Output State: **t is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, _ is t, n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is an integer, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is len(a) - 1, l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is m plus b[s-1] plus the integer division of bd[s] times ql by ad[s], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], nothing is printed, stdin contains 0 inputs, and an empty line is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all test cases. The loop counter `_` is equal to the total number of test cases `t`. The variables `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `l`, `ql`, `m`, and `s` have the same values as in the last iteration of the loop. The input has been fully consumed, and an empty line has been printed for each test case.
