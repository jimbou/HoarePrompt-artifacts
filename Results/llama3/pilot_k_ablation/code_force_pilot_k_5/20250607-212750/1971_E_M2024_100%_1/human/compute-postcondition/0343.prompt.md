Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least `len(a)` integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(a) + len(b) - 1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1]` - `b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `v` now contains `len(a)` integers, where each integer is the division of the corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`. The variable `i` has reached `len(a) - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is at least 1, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(a) + len(b) - 1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is 1, l is 0, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], nothing is printed, t is at least 1, stdin contains -1 inputs, and m is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is at least 2, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(a) + len(b) - 1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is 1, l is 1, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is an integer equal to b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], nothing is printed, t is at least 1, stdin contains -1 inputs, and this is printed: m (where m is an integer equal to b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `l`, `m`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `ql` is decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`. The value of `m` is increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`. The stdin contains -1 inputs if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, otherwise it contains -2 inputs, and the value of `m` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n, k, q, a, ad, bd, v, t are unchanged, i is 1, m is increased by the value of b[s - 1] and then further increased by the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, ql is decreased by the value of a[s - 1], l is increased by 1, and the value of m is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n`, `k`, `q`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `t` are unchanged, `i` is 1, `m` is increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `ql` is decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2, and the value of `m` which is 0 is printed, `m` is 0, `ql` is an integer from stdin, `s` is an integer, and the value of `m` which is 0 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
