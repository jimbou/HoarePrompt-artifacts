Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing three integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `v` now contains three elements: the initial 0, the ratio of the first elements of `ad` and `bd`, and the ratio of the second elements of `ad` and `bd`.
