Postcondition: ***n, k, q, a, ad, bd, v, t are unchanged, i is 1, m is increased by the value of b[s - 1] and then further increased by the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, ql is decreased by the value of a[s - 1], l is increased by 1, and the value of m is printed. If a[s] is equal to ql, stdin contains -1 inputs, the value of b[s] is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, stdin contains -2 inputs.***
