Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `q` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `ad` is unchanged, `bd` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `m` is increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `t` is unchanged, `ql` is decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`, `l` is increased by 1, stdin contains -1 inputs if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, otherwise it contains -2 inputs, and the value of `m` is printed, and the value of `b[s]` is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
