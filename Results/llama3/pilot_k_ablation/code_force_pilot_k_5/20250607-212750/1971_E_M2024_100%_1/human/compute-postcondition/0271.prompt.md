Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is an integer, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is len(a) - 1, l is q - 1, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is m plus b[s-1] plus the integer division of bd[s] times ql by ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and nothing is printed, t is at least 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: a list of at least k+1 integers and a list of at least k+1 integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
