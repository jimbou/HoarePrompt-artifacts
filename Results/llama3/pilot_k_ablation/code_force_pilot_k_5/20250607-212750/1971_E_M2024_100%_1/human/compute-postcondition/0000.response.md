Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 10^5 and k <= n <= 10^9. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is: the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^4. The rest of the input remains the same, with each test case containing four lines of input, and the constraints on the values of n, k, and q still apply.
