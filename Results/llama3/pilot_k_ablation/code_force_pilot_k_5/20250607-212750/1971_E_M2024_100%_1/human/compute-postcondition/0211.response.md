Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is 1, l is 0, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), m is 0, and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

The code block modifies the values of `m`, `i`, `ql`, and `s`. The first line sets `m` to 0. The second line sets `i` to 1. The third line assigns the integer value of the input to `ql`. The fourth line assigns the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)` to `s`, which is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order. The value of `ql` is now an integer such that `ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1]` (q times), and the value of `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`. No other variables are affected.
