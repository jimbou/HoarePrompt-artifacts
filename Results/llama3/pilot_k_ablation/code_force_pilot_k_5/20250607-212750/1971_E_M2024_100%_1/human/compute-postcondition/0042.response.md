Output State: **t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, _ is 0, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain the same, but the loop will continue with the next iteration.
