Output State: **`n`, `k`, `q`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `t` are unchanged, `i` is 1, `m` is increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `ql` is decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2, and the value of `m` is printed, `m` is 0, `ql` is an integer from stdin, `s` is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The value of `m` has been increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`. The value of `s` is still the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order. The value of `ql` has been decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`. The value of `l` is still 2. The value of `m` has been printed. The value of `m` is now 0. The value of `ql` is still an integer from stdin. The value of `s` is still an integer.
