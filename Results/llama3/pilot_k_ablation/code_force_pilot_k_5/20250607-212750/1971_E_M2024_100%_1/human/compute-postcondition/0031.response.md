Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing four integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ad[3] / bd[3], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list, where `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `v` now contains four integers: 0, the ratio of the first two elements of `ad` and `bd`, the ratio of the second two elements of `ad` and `bd`, and the ratio of the third two elements of `ad` and `bd`.
