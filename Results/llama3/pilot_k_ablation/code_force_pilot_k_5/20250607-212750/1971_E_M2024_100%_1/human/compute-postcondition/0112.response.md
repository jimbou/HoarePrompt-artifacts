Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing 2 integers 0, ad[i] / bd[i], `i` is 1, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`, where `i` is 1. The value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` is calculated as the division of the `i-th` element of the list `ad` by the `i-th` element of the list `bd`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
