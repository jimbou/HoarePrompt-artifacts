Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers that must have at least 5 elements, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing four integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], and a[5] - a[4], `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three lines of input. The first line contains q integers, i is 6**

In this output state, the value of `ad` has been updated by appending the difference between the 5th and 4th elements of list `a`. The value of `i` has also been incremented to 6. The other variables remain unchanged.
