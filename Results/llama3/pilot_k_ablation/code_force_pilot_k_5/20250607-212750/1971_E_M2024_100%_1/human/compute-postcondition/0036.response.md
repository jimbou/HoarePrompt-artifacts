Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `v` will contain `k+1` integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining `k` integers are the result of dividing the corresponding elements in the `ad` list by the corresponding elements in the `bd` list. The value of `i` will be equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
