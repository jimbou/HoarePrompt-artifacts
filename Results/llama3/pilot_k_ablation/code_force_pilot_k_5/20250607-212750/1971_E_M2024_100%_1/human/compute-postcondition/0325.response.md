The only variable in the loop head is variable  l, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is not specified, `q` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `l` must be increased by 1. 
State: **The values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `m`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `ql` is decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`. The value of `m` is increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`. The stdin contains -1 inputs if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, otherwise it contains -2 inputs, and the value of `m` is printed, `l` is increased by 1**
