Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least `k+1` integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(a) + 2` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) + 1` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1]` - `b[len(b) - 2]`, `b[len(b)]` - `b[len(b) - 1]`, `b[len(b) + 1]` - `b[len(b)]`, `b[i]` - `b[i - 1]`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `ad[1]` / `bd[1]`, `ad[2]` / `bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1]` / `bd[len(a) - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) + 2`, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `bd` has been appended with a new element, which is the difference between the `i-th` element of `b` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
