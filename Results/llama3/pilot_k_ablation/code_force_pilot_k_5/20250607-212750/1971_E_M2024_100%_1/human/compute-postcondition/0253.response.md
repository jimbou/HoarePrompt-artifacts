Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q must be greater than 4, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is 1, l is 4, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is m plus b[s-1] plus the integer division of bd[s] times ql by ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

The code modifies the values of ql and m. The first line subtracts a[s-1] from ql, effectively shifting the value of ql to be within the range of a[s-1] and a[s]. The second line adds b[s-1] to m. The third line adds the integer division of bd[s] times ql by ad[s] to m. The other variables remain unchanged.
