The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `b` is a list of at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `b` must be a list of at least 4 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least `k+1` integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `k+5` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[k]` - `b[k-1]`, `b[i]` - `b[i - 1]`, `b[i+1]` - `b[i]`, `b[i+1]` - `b[i]`, `b[i]` - `b[i - 1]`, `v` is a list containing `k+2` integers 0, `ad[1]` / `bd[1]`, `ad[2]` / `bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k]` / `bd[k]`, `ad[k+1]` / `bd[k+1]`, `i` is 4, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer such that `ql` = `ql` - `a[s - 1]` - `a[s - 1]` - ... - `a[s - 1]` (`q` times), `m` is an integer such that `m` = `m` + `b[s - 1]` + `b[s - 1]` + ... + `b[s - 1]` (`q` times) + `bd[s]` * `ql` // `ad[s]` + `bd[s]` * `ql` // `ad[s]` + ... + `bd[s]` * `ql` // `ad[s]` (`q` times), and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `_` is equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than `t`.**
