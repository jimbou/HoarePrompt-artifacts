The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be a list of at least 3 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(a)` + `len(b)` - 1 integers, `ad` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `ad[2]` / `bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1]` / `bd[len(a) - 1]`, `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `ad[1]` / `bd[1]`, `ad[2]` / `bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1]` / `bd[len(a) - 1]`, `i` is 2, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, nothing is printed, `t` is at least 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, and nothing is printed.**
