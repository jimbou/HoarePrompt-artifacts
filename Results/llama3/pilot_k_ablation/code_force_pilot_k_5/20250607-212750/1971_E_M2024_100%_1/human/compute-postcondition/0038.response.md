Output State: **t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, _ is 0, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code block executes as follows: The first line assigns the value 0 to `m`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `i`. The third line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ql`. The fourth line uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for `ql` in the sorted list `a` and assigns the result to `s`. The value of `s` is such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`. No other variables are affected.
