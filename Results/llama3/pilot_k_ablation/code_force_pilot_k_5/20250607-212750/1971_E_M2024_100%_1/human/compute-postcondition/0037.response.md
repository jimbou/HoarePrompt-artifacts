The only variable in the loop head is variable `l` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `l` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to 0.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `l` is 0**
