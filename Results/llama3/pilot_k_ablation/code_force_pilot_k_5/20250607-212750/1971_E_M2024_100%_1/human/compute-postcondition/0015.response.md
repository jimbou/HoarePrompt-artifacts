Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing two integers 0 and b[1] - b[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between the second element of `b` and the first element of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
