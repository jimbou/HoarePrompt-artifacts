Output State: **t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, _ is 0, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is q, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), m is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and this is printed: m (where m is the updated value of m after the calculation m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times)).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `l` is now equal to `q`, indicating that the loop has executed `q` times. The value of `ql` has been updated to be the result of subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it `q` times. The value of `m` has been updated to be the result of adding `b[s - 1]` to it `q` times, and adding the result of dividing `bd[s] * ql` by `ad[s]` to it `q` times. The value of `s` remains an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`. The updated value of `m` is printed.
