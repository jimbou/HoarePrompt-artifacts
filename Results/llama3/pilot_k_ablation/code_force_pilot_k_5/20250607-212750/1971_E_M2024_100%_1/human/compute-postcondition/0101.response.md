The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `b`. If `i` is less than the length of the list `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and the length of the list `b` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least 3 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+2 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], b[k+1] - b[k], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 2, l is q, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), m is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]**
