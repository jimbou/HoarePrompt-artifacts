Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is q, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), m is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and nothing is printed**

The code first reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `q`, respectively. Then, it reads `k+1` integers from the input and assigns them to the list `a`, starting from index 1. Similarly, it reads `k+1` integers from the input and assigns them to the list `b`, starting from index 1. The lists `ad` and `bd` are initialized with a single element, 0. The code does not modify the values of `i`, `l`, `ql`, `m`, or `s`, nor does it print anything.
