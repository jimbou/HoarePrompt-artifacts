Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `b` is a list of at least `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)+1` integers 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `a[i+1] - a[i]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]`, `i` is 4, `l` is `q - 1`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `t` is at least 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the list `ad` has been updated to include the difference between the current element and the previous element of list `a` at index `i`, which is 4. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
