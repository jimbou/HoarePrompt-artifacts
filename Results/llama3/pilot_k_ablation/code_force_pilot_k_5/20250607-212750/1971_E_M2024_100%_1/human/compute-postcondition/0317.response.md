Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is at least 2, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(a) + len(b) - 1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is 1, l is 2, ql is an integer equal to the input, m is 0, s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], nothing is printed, t is at least 1, stdin contains -2 inputs.**

The code block has the following effects on the program state:

1. `m = 0` resets the value of `m` to 0.
2. `i = 1` resets the value of `i` to 1.
3. `ql = int(input())` reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ql`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1.
4. `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` finds the insertion point for `ql` in the sorted list `a` to maintain sorted order. This assigns an integer value to `s` such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`.

The final state includes all the variables and their values as specified in the initial state, with the following changes:

* `m` is now 0.
* `i` is now 1.
* `ql` is now an integer equal to the input.
* `s` is now an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`.
* `stdin` contains -2 inputs.

All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
