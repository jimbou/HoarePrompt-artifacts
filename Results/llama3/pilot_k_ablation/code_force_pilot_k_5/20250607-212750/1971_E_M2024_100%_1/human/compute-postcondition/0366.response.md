The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(b)`. If `i` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `len(b)` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `len(b)` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least `len(a)` integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]`, `i` is 4, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`, nothing is printed, `t` is at least 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, and nothing is printed.**
