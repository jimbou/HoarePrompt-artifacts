Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+2 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], a[i] - a[i - 1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and nothing is printed, `_` is equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than `t`.**

The code appends the difference between the current element and the previous element of list `a` to the list `ad`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
