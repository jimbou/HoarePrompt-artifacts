Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing len(a) integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], i is 1, l is 1, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q - 1 times), m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], m is 0, i is 1, ql is an integer read from stdin, s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `l`, `ql`, `m`, and `s` are updated according to the code snippet. The value of `m` is reset to 0, and the value of `i` is set to 1. The value of `ql` is read from stdin, and the value of `s` is determined by the bisect_left function, which returns the insertion point for `ql` in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
