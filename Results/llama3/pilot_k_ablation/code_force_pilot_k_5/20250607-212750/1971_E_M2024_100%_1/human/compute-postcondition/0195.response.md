Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least `k+1` integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(b)` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1]` - `b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing `k+1` integers 0, `ad[1]` / `bd[1]`, `ad[2]` / `bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k]` / `bd[k]`, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer such that `ql` = `ql` - `a[s - 1]` - `a[s - 1]` - ... - `a[s - 1]` (`q` times), `m` is an integer such that `m` = `m` + `b[s - 1]` + `b[s - 1]` + ... + `b[s - 1]` (`q` times) + `bd[s]` * `ql` // `ad[s]` + `bd[s]` * `ql` // `ad[s]` + ... + `bd[s]` * `ql` // `ad[s]` (`q` times), and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `_` is equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than `t`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `bd` now contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `b`, and the loop counter `i` has reached the length of list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
