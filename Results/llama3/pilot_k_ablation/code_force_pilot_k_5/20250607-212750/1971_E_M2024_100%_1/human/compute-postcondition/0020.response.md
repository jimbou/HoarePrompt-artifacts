The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and list b. If i is less than len(b) the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3, b is a list of at least 4 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time i is 4 and for the loop to execute again b must be a list of at least 5 integers.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 5 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing six integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3], and b[5] - b[4], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 4**
