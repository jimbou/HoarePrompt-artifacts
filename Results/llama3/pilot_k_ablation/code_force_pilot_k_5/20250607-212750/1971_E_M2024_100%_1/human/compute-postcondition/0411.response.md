Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the value of `m`, which is an integer equal to the sum of `b[s-1]` and the integer division of `(bd[s] * ql)` by `ad[s]`. 

Since `m` is printed followed by a space, the output will be the value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **m (where m is the updated value) followed by a space**
