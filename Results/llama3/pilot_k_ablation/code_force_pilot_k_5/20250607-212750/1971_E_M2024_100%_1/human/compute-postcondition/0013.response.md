Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three lines of input. The first line contains q integers, i is k+1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ad` will contain `k+1` integers, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `k+1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `k` times. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
