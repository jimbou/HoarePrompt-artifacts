Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(a) + len(b) - 1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1]` - `b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing 2 integers 0 and `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `i` is 1, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `v` now contains two integers: 0 and the result of dividing `ad[1]` by `bd[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
