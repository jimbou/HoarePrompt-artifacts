Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is 1, `l` is 4, `ql` is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1], `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and `m` (where `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]) and `b[s]` are printed, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration is continued. The values of all variables remain the same, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
