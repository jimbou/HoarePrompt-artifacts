Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 5 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+7 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], a[i] - a[i - 1], a[i+1] - a[i], a[i+1] - a[i], a[i+1] - a[i], a[i] - a[i - 1], a[i] - a[i - 1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is 5, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and nothing is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ad` has been appended with a new element, which is the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
