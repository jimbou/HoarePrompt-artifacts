Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 0, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

The provided code snippet modifies the values of `ql` and `m`. The first line subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`, effectively decreasing `ql` by the value of the element at index `s - 1` in list `a`. The second line increments `m` by the value of `b[s - 1]`, adding the element at index `s - 1` in list `b` to `m`. The third line further increments `m` by the product of `bd[s]` and the integer division of `ql` by `ad[s]`, effectively adding the result of this calculation to `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
