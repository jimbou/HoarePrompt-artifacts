Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 5 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing seven integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3], b[5] - b[4], and b[4] - b[3], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 4**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the list `bd` now contains seven integers instead of six, with the additional integer being the difference between `b[4]` and `b[3]`.
