Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is k, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a` and `b`, and the list `v` contains the result of the division of each corresponding element in `ad` and `bd`. The value of `i` is now equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has finished iterating. The values of `l`, `ql`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 0, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and the value of m which is equal to m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 1, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], m is 0, i is 1, ql is the input integer, and s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and this is printed: m (where m is an integer equal to m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 2, ql is an integer equal to ql - a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]. If a[s] is equal to ql, then the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. The value of m, which is equal to b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 2, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 3, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is an integer equal to the sum of b[s-1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and this is printed: m (where m is the sum of b[s-1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s])

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 3, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 4, ql is an integer equal to ql - a[s-1], m is an integer equal to m + b[s-1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and the value of m is being printed, where m is an integer equal to m + b[s-1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
