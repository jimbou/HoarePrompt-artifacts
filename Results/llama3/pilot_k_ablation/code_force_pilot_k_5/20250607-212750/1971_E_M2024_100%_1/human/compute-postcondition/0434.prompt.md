Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 10^5 and k <= n <= 10^9. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, _ is 0, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is q, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), m is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and nothing is printed

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
