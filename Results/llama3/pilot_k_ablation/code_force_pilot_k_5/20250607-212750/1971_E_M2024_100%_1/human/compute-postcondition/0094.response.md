The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `a` has at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+5 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], a[i] - a[i - 1], a[i+1] - a[i], a[i+1] - a[i], a[i+1] - a[i], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is 4, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1] (q times), `m` is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1] (q times) + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] (q times), and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and nothing is printed.**
