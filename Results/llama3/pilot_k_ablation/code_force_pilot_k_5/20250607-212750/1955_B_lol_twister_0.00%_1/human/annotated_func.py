#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given sorted list of integers can be arranged in a specific pattern. It takes four parameters: an integer n greater than or equal to 2, integers c and d greater than or equal to 1, and a sorted list l of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1. The function returns 'no' if the difference between the last and first elements of the list is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), or if the middle element of the list (when n is odd) is not equal to the average of the first and last elements, or if any pair of elements at equal distances from the start and end of the list are not equal. Otherwise, it returns 'yes'.
