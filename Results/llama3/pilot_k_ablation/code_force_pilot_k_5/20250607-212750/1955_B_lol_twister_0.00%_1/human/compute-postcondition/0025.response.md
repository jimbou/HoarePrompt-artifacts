Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 4. If the kth element of `l` is not equal to the (-k)th element from the end of `l`, the function returns the string 'no'. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
