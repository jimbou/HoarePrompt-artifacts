To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `r`. The loop will execute if `r` is at least 1, since `range(r)` will generate at least one value for `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0**
