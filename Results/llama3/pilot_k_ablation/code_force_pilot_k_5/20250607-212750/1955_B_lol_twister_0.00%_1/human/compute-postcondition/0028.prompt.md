You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1.
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns the string 'no'.
    #State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1. The difference between the last and the first element of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns the string 'NO'.
        #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 divided by 2. The current value of n is an odd number. The value of the element at index r in list l is equal to a divided by 2.
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 divided by 2. If n is an odd number, the value of the element at index r in list l is equal to a divided by 2.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is `r`. If the kth element of `l` is not equal to the (-k)th element from the end of `l`, the function returns the string 'no'. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns the string 'yes'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'no'.

Case_2: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 divided by 2. The current value of n is an odd number. The value of the element at index r in list l is equal to a divided by 2.

Case_3: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is `r`. If the kth element of `l` is not equal to the (-k)th element from the end of `l`, the function returns the string 'no'. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Case_4: The program returns the string 'yes'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
