The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `r`. If `k` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, `r` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `r` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 4**
