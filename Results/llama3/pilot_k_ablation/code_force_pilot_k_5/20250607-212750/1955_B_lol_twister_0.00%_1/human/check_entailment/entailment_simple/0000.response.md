Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the problem description. The program first sorts the list and checks if the difference between the last and first elements is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). If not, it returns 'no'. If the difference is correct, it calculates the sum of the first and last elements and checks if the middle element (if n is odd) is equal to half of this sum. If not, it returns 'NO'. If the middle element is correct, it checks if the first half of the list is equal to the reversed second half of the list. If not, it returns 'no'. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes'.

The program correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks all necessary conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
