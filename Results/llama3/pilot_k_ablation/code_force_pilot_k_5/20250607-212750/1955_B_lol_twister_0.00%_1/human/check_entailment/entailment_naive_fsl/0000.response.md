Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly verify if a progressive square can be constructed from the given array elements. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array is equal to (n-1) * (c+d), and if the middle element (if n is odd) is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum elements. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that a progressive square can be constructed.

A counterexample is when n = 3, c = 2, d = 3, and the array is [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]. The program will return 'yes', but a progressive square cannot be constructed from these elements.

The correct approach would be to generate the progressive square based on the given parameters n, c, and d, and then check if all elements in the generated square are present in the given array. If any element is missing, return 'no'. Otherwise, return 'yes'.
