Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1.
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns the string 'no'.
    #State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1. The difference between the last and the first element of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns the string 'NO'.
        #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 divided by 2. The current value of n is an odd number. The value of the element at index r in list l is equal to a divided by 2.
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 divided by 2. If n is an odd number, the value of the element at index r in list l is equal to a divided by 2.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is `r`. If the kth element of `l` is not equal to the (-k)th element from the end of `l`, the function returns the string 'no'. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns the string 'yes'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given sorted list of integers can be arranged in a specific pattern. It takes four parameters: an integer n greater than or equal to 2, integers c and d greater than or equal to 1, and a sorted list l of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1. The function returns 'no' if the difference between the last and first elements of the list is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), or if the middle element of the list (when n is odd) is not equal to the average of the first and last elements, or if any pair of elements at equal distances from the start and end of the list are not equal. Otherwise, it returns 'yes'.
