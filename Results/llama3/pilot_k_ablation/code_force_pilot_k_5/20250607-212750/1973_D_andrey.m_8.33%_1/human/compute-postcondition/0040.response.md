Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means that it will exit the innermost loop or if statement that it is currently inside. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does change the control flow of the program. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that we have broken out of the innermost loop or if statement.
