Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(...func_1(1, m) + 1, m)... + 1, m)` (with `k` iterations of `func_1`), `j` is `k-1`, and the current value of `p` is equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is decremented by 1, and the value of `p` is still equal to `n`. The function `func_2(m)` is executed, but its effect on the state is not specified, so we assume it does not change any of the variables.
