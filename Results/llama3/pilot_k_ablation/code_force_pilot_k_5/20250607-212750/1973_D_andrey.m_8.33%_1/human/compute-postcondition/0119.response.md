The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `k` is at least `j` and at most `n`. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 5 and at most `n`.
State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 5 and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 5, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is greater than or equal to `n`.**
