To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The only object in the loop head is `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 2.

The state of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) remains unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 2, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, m)`**
