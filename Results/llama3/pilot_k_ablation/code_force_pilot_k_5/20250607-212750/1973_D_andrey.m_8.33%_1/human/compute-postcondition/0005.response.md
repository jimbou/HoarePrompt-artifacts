To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is used to ignore the loop variable, so we don't need to worry about its value.

The current state is:

* `t` is an integer greater than 1
* `_` is 1 (but we can ignore this value since it's not used)
* The function `func_3()` has been executed (this is not relevant to the loop state)

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `_` is still within the range of `t`. Since `_` is currently 1, we need to increment it to 2 for the loop to execute again.

So, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2**

Note that we didn't change the value of `t`, since it's not modified by the loop. We only incremented the value of `_` to 2, which is the next value in the range of `t`.
