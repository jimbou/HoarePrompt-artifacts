Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
