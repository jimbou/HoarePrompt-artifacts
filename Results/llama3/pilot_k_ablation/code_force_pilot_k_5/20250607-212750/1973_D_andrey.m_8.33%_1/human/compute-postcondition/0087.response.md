Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 2, m)`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 2, m)`, which is the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `p + 1` and `m`, where `p` was previously equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
