Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    r = func_1(1, i * n)
    if r <= n:
        assert r == n
        max_val = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, `r` is equal to `func_1(1, n * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, `r` is equal to `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, `r` is equal to `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is set to `n-2`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `r` is equal to `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` and `max_val` is equal to `n-3`. Otherwise, `max_val` is either 0 or `n-3` depending on whether `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` is greater than `n` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is at least 4, i is equal to n-4, k is a positive integer, stdin is empty. If r is less than or equal to n, max_val is equal to n-4. Otherwise, max_val is either 0 or n-3 depending on whether func_1(1, (n-3) * n) is greater than n or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
