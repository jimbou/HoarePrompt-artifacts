Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(...func_1(1, m) + 1, m)... + 1, m)` (with `k` iterations of `func_1`), `j` is `k`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `p` is the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly to the initial value of `p` (which is 0) and the value of `m`, with the number of iterations equal to the value of `k`. The variable `j` is equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. If the final value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the loop; otherwise, no action is taken.
