Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is 3. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
