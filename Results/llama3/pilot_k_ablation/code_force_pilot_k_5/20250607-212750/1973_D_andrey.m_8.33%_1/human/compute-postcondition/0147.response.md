Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at most n, i is equal to n // k - 4, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is equal to 0, j is equal to k, and p is equal to func_1(p + 1, m).**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of j has reached k, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of p has been updated to func_1(p + 1, m), which is the result of the last iteration of the loop. The values of the other variables, n, k, i, max_val, and m, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
