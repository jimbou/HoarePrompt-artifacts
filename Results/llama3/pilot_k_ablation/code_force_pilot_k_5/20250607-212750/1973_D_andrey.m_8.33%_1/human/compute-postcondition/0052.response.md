Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer, i is equal to n // k - 1, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is 0, p is 0, j is k - 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Since `i` is equal to `n // k - 1` and `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `m` becomes 0 because `max_val` is either 0 or a value that makes `i * max_val` equal to 0. The second line assigns the value 0 to `p`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state.
