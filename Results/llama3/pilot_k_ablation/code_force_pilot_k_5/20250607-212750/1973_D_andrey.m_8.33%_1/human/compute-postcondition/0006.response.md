Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `func_3` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The only change is that the function `func_3` has been executed, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its specific effects on the program state.
