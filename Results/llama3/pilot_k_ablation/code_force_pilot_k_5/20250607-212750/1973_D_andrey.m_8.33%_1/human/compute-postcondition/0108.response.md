Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 2, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus 1, and `m` as arguments, and then calling `func_1` again with the result of the first call plus 1, and `m` as arguments.
