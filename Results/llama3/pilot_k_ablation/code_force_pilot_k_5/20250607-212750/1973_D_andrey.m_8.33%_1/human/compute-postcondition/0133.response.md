Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
