Postcondition: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(...func_1(1, m) + 1, m)... + 1, m)` (with `k` iterations of `func_1`), `j` is `k`. The current value of `p` is equal to `n`.**
