Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 2, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`**

The value of `p` is updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`, where `p` was previously equal to `func_1(1, m)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
