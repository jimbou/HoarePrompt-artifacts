To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4, and `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5.

The state of `k` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 5, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)`**
