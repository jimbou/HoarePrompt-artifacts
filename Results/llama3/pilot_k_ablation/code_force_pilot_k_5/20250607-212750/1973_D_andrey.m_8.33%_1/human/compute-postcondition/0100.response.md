Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at most n, i is equal to n // k - 3, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is equal to i * max_val, j is equal to k, and p is equal to 0.**

The code modifies the values of `m` and `p`. The first line reassigns the value of `m` to be equal to `i * max_val`, which is the same as its initial value. The second line sets the value of `p` to 0, overwriting its initial value. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `j` remain unchanged.
