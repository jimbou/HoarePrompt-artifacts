Output State: **n is at least 4, i is equal to n-4, k is a positive integer, r is equal to func_1(1, (n-4) * n), max_val is equal to n-4, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `max_val` has been updated to `n-4`, which is the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.
