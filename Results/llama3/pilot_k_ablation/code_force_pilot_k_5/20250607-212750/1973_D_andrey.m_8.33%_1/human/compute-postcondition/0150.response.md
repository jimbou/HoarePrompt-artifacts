Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and performs the following actions:**

*   It iterates from n down to 1 to find the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, and stores this value in max_val. If no such i is found, max_val remains 0.
*   It then iterates from n // k down to 1 to find a value m (which is a multiple of max_val) such that func_1(p + 1, m) equals n after k iterations of func_1, starting from p = 0. If such a value m is found, it calls func_2(m) and returns.
*   If no such value m is found after iterating from n // k down to 1, it calls func_2(-1) and returns.

**The function's purpose is to find a specific value m that satisfies a certain condition involving the func_1 function, and then calls func_2 with this value or -1 if no such value is found.**
