Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is at least 5, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement and continue executing the code outside of it.
