Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(1, m)`, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `max_val`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `p` is updated to be the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `1` and `m`, where `m` is `i` times `max_val`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 1.
