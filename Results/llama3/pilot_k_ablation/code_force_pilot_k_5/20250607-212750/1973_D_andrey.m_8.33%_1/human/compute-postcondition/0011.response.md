Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_3()` has been executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (it is still an integer greater than or equal to 0), the variable `_` now holds the value of `t-1` (since the loop iterates `t` times and `_` is incremented each time), and the function `func_3()` has been called and executed `t` times.
