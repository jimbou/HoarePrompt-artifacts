To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`. To execute the loop again, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n // k - 3`.

The state of `n` and `k` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to `k`, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + k - 1, m)`**
