According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is at least `k`, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `k` is a positive integer, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, and `p` is 0. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `k` is at least 1 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`n` is at least `k`, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1**
