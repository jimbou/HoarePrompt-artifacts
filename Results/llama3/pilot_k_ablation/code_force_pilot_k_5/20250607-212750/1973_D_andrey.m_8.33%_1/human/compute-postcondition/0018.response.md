The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-4` and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 0 so `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is equal to `n-4`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `r` is equal to `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` and `max_val` is equal to `n-3`. Otherwise, `max_val` is either 0 or `n-3` depending on whether `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` is greater than `n` or not.**
