Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is equal to `func_1(1, m)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
