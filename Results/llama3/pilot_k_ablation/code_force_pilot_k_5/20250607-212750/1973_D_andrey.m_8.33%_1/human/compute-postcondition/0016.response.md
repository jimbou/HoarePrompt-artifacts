Output State: **n is at least 2, i is equal to n-3, k is a positive integer, r is equal to func_1(1, (n-3) * n), max_val is equal to n-3.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `max_val`. Since `i` is equal to `n-3`, `max_val` becomes `n-3`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state is preserved for all variables except `max_val`, which is updated to `n-3`. The value of `r` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is still a positive integer, and `n` is still at least 2. The `stdin` remains empty.
