Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 3, `p` is either greater than or equal to `n` or updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus 1, and `m` as arguments, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.
