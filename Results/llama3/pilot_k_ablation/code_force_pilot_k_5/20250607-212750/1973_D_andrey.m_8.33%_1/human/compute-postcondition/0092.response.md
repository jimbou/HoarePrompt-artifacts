Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 4, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 3, m)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` retain their initial values, and the relationship between them remains the same. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
