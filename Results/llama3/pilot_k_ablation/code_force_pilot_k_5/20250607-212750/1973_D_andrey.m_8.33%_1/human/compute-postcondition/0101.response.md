To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 1, and `p` is equal to 0**
