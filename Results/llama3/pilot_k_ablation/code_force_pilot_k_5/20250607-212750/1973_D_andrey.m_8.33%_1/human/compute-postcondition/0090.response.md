To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, and `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4. The value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 4, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 2, m)`**
