Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 1, `p` is equal to `func_1(1, 0)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
