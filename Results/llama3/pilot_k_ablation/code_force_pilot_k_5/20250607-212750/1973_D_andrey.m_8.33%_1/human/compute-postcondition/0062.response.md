To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is a positive integer and at least 1.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes at least 3. The value of `k` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is at least 3, `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`**
