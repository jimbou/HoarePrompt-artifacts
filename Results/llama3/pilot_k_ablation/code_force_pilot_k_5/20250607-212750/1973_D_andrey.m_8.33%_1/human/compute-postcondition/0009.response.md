The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `t` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `_` is 4, and the function `func_3` has been executed twice**
