Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
