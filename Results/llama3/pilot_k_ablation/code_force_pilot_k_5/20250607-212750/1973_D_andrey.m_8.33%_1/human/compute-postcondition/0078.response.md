Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, m)`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `1` and `m`, where `m` is equal to `i * max_val`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
