Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is equal to `k`, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` (with `k` iterations of `func_1`), and the function `func_2(-1)` has been executed and returned a value.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function `func_2(-1)` has been executed and returned a value. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.
