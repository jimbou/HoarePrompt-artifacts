Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 4, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, which is indicated by the additional information "and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement."
