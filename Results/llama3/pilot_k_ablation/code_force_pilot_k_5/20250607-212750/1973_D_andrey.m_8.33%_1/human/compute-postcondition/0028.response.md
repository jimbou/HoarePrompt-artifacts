Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(1, m)`, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `p` is still greater than or equal to `n`.
