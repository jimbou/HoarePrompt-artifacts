Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to `func_1(p + 1, m)`, where `p` was previously `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
