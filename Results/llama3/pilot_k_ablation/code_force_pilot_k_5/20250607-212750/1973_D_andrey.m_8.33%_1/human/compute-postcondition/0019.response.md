Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is equal to `n-4`, `k` is a positive integer, `r` is equal to `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`, `max_val` is either 0 or `n-3` depending on whether `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` is greater than `n` or not, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`, which is a result of the function call with arguments `1` and `(n-4) * n`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `max_val` is still dependent on the comparison of `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` with `n`, but its possible values are now either 0 or `n-3`. The stdin remains empty.
