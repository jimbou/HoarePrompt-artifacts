Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 2, m)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` retain their initial values and relationships, and no new assignments or changes are made to these variables. The only effect of the `break` statement is to exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
