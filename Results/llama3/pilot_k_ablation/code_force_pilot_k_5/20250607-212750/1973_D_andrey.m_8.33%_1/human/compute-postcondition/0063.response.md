Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is at least 3, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, 0)` which is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`**.

The code assigns a new value to `p` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. Since `m` is 0, the function call is equivalent to `func_1(p + 1, 0)`. The value of `p` is updated to the result of this function call. The other variables remain unchanged.
