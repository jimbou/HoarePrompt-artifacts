Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, `r` is equal to `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)`, `max_val` is either 0 or `n-3` depending on whether `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` is greater than `n` or not.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)`, which is the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `1` and `(n-3) * n`. The value of `max_val` depends on whether `r` is less than or equal to `n` or not. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is set to `n-3`, otherwise it remains 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
