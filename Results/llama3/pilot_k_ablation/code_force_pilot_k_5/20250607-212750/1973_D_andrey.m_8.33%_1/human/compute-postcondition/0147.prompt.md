Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at most n, i is equal to n // k - 4, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is equal to 0, j is equal to k, and p is equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    p = func_1(p + 1, m)
    if p >= n:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 1, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, 0)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 4, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 5, `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
