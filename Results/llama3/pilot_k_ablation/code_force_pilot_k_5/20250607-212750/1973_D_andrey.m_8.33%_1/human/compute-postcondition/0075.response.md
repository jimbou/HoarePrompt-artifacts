To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n // k` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 1.

The other variables in the loop head are `n` and `k`. Since `n` is at least `k`, we can't adjust `n` without knowing its exact value. However, we can adjust `k` to ensure that the loop can execute again.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, we can set `k` to a value that ensures `n // k - 1` is greater than 0.

Let's assume `k` is a positive integer and at least 1. To ensure that `n // k - 1` is greater than 0, we can set `k` to a value that is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`
* `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`
* `n` is at least `k`
* `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`
* `m` is 0
* `j` is equal to `k`
* `p` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is equal to `k`, and `p` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`**
