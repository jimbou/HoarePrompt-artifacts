Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
