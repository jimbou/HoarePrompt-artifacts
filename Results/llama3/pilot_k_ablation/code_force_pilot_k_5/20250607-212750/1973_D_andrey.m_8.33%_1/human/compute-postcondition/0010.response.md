Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `_` is 4, and the function `func_3` has been executed three times**

The code calls the function `func_3`, which has already been executed twice in the initial state. After executing the code, the function `func_3` has now been executed three times. The values of the variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them.
