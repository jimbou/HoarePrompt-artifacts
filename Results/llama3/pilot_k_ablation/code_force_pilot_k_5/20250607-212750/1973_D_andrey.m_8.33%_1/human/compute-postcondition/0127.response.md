Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 1, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, 0)`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` (which is 1, since `p` was initially 0) and `m` (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
