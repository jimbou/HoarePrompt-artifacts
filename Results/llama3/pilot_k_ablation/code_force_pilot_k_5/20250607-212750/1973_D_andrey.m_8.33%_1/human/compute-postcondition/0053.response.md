To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1 (since the range starts from 1) and `j` is initialized to a value that will allow the loop to start. Since `j` is initialized to `k - 1` before the loop, we need to adjust `j` to be at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `p` is 0, `j` is at least 1**
