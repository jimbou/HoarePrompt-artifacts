Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0)` is updated to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0) + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still at least `k`, `k` is still a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is still equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is still either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is still equal to 0, `j` is still equal to 3, and `p` is now equal to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0) + 1` which is one more than its previous value.
