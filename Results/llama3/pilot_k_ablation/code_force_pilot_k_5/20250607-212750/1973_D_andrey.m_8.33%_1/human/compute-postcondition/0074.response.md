Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at least 1, i is equal to n // k - 1, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is 0, j is equal to k, and p is either greater than or equal to n or less than n.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of j has reached k. The value of p is either greater than or equal to n, in which case the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement, or less than n, in which case the loop completed all its iterations without breaking out. The values of n, k, i, max_val, and m remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
