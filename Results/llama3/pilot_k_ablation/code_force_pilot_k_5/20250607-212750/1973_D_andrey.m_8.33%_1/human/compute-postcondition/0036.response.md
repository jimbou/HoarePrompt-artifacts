Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged. However, we exit the innermost loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
