The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(1, m)`, `j` is 2**
