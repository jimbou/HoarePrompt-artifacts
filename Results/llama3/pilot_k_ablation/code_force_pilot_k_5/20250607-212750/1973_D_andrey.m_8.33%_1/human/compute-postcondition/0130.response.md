Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 1, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, 0)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`.***
