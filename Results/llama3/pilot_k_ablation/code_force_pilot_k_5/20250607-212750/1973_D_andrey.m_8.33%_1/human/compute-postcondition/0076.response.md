Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at most n, i is equal to n // k - 2, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is equal to i * max_val, j is equal to k, and p is 0**

The code modifies the values of `m` and `p`. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`, making `m` equal to the product of `i` and `max_val`. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `p`, making `p` equal to 0. No other variables are affected.
