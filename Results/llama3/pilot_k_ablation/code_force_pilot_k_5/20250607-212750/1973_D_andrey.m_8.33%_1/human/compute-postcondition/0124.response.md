To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement. The loop head is `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):`.

From the given state, we know that `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1 (since the step is -1). Therefore, `i` should be `n // k - 4`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n` and `k`. Since `n` is at least `k` and `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, we can't adjust these variables. They remain the same.

The other variables (`max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`) are not in the loop head, so we can't adjust them.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to `k`, and `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is greater than or equal to `n`.**
