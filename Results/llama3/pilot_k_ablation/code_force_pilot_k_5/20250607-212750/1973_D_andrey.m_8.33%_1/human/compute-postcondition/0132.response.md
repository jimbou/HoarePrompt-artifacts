Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, and `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0)`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to `func_1(func_1(1, 0) + 1, 0)`, which is the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus one as the first argument and `m` (which is 0) as the second argument. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
