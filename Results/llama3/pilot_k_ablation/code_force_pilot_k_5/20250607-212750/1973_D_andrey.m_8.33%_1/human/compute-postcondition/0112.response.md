Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 3, `p` is either greater than or equal to `n` or updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus 1, and `m` as arguments.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus 1, and `m` as arguments. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `p` is now either greater than or equal to `n` or the result of the function call.
