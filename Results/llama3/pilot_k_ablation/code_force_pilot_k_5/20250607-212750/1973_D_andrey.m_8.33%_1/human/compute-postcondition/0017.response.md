Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `r` is equal to `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` and `max_val` is equal to `n-3`. Otherwise, `max_val` is either 0 or `n-3` depending on whether `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)` is greater than `n` or not.***
