To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1**
