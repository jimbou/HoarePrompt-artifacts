To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the loop statement, `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be equal to 2.

The value of `k` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, and `p` is equal to `func_1(1, 0)`**
