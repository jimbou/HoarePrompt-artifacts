Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0 (since the loop iterates from `n` down to 1), `k` is still a positive integer, and `stdin` is still empty. The value of `max_val` is either 0 (if `func_1(1, i * n)` is always greater than `n` for all `i` from `n` down to 1) or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`.
