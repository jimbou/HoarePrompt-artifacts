Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the function `func_3()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The only change is that the function `func_3()` has been executed, but since we don't have any information about what this function does, we can't determine its effect on the program state.
