Output State: **n is at least k, i is equal to n // k, k is a positive integer, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is i times max_val, p is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Since `i` is equal to `n // k` and `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `m` is either 0 or a multiple of `n // k`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `p`. 

The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `max_val` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` is not relevant as it is empty. The final state includes the new variables `m` and `p` with their assigned values, as well as the unchanged variables from the initial state.
