Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 1, and the current value of `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variable values.
