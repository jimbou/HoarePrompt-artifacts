Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `func_3()` has been called and executed, but its return value is not assigned to any variable.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The function `func_3()` is called and executed, but its return value is not assigned to any variable, so it does not affect the state of the program.
