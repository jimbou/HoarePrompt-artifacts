According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and the loop counter `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 3, and `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `_` is 3, and the function `func_3` has been executed.**
