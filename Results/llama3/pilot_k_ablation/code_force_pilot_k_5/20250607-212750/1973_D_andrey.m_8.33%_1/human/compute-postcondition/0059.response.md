Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `p` is now dependent on the result of the function `func_1`, which is not specified in the initial state.
