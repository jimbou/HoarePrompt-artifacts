Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 5 and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 5, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is greater than or equal to `n` and also equal to `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m), m)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their previous values as specified in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
