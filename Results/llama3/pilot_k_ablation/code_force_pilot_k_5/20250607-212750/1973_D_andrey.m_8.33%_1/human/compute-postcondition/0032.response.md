Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which does not change the values of any variables. However, it does exit the innermost loop or if statement that it is directly inside. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
