Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 4, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is greater than or equal to `n`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `p` is now greater than or equal to `n`, as it was before, but its exact value has been updated based on the result of the function call.
