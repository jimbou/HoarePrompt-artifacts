Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.
