Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is at least 5, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `p` and `n` is still applicable, meaning that if the new value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
