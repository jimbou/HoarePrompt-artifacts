To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n // k` must be greater than 0, because the loop needs to execute at least once. This implies that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
2. `i` is initialized to `n // k`, which means it must be greater than 0. This is already ensured by the previous point.
3. The loop iterates from `n // k` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time. This means that `n // k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`
* `i` is equal to `n // k`, which is greater than 0
* `k` is a positive integer (no change needed)

The other variables (`stdin`, `max_val`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `k` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`**
