Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at most n, i is equal to n // k - 2, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is equal to i * max_val, j is equal to k, and p is equal to func_1(func_1(1, m) + k - 1, m). If p is greater than or equal to n, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `j` is now equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The value of `p` is the result of the function `func_1` called with the arguments `func_1(1, m) + k - 1` and `m`. If the result of this function call is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.
