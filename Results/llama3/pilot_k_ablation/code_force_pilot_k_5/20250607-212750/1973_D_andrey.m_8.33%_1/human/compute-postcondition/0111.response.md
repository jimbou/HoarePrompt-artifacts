To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3. The value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables, `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is equal to 3, `p` is either greater than or equal to `n` or updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus 1, and `m` as arguments, and then calling `func_1` again with the result of the first call plus 1, and `m` as arguments.**
