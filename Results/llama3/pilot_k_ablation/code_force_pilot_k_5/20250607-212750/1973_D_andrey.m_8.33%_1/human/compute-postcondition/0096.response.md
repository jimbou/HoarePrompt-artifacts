Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is equal to `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `i * max_val`, `j` is 5, `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 4, m)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the current loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
