Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer and at most n, i is equal to n // k - 3, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n, m is equal to i * max_val, j is equal to k, and p is equal to func_1(p + 1, m) which is greater than or equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `j` has reached `k`. The value of `p` is the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `p` plus 1, and `m` as arguments, which is greater than or equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged.
