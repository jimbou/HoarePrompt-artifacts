Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 5, `p` is equal to `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`, which is a new value based on the previous value of `p` and the function `func_1`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
