Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at most `n`, `i` is equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is equal to `k`, and `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)` (with `k` iterations of `func_1`).**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `i` has reached 0, which is the lower bound of the loop. The values of `n`, `k`, and `max_val` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `m` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished its last iteration. The value of `j` is equal to `k`, indicating that the inner loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `p` is the result of applying `func_1` to `p + 1` and `m` for `k` iterations, which is the final value of `p` after the loop completes.
