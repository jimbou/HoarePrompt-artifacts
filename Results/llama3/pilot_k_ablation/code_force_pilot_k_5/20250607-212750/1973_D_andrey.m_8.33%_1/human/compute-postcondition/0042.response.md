The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 5, `i` is equal to `n // k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is 5**
