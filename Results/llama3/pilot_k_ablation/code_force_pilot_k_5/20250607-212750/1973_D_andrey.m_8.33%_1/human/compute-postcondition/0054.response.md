Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is equal to `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `p` is `func_1(1, 0)`, `j` is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to `func_1(1, 0)`, which is the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
