Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. `func_1(l, x)`: This function takes two positive integers `l` and `x` as input, prints them to the console in the format '? l x', waits for user input, and returns the user's input as an integer. This function is used to query the hidden array and get the smallest positive integer `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`, or `n+1` if no such `r` exists.

2. `func_2(m)`: This function prints the largest value `m` such that there exists a sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` satisfying the given conditions, and then reads and returns an integer input from the user. This function is used to output the answer.

3. `func_3()`: This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and performs the following actions:
   - It finds the maximum value `max_val` such that there exists a sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` satisfying the given conditions.
   - It iterates over possible values of `i` from `n // k` to `1` and calculates `m = i * max_val`.
   - For each `m`, it queries the hidden array using `func_1` to find the smallest positive integer `p` such that `f(1, p) = m`.
   - If `p == n`, it means that the sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` satisfies the given conditions, and it outputs the answer using `func_2(m)`.
   - If no such `m` is found, it outputs `-1` using `func_2(-1)`.

4. `func_4()`: This function reads an integer `t` from standard input and executes `func_3()` that many times.

The program correctly implements the interactive game described in the problem statement. It uses `func_1` to query the hidden array, `func_2` to output the answer, and `func_3` to find the largest value `m` such that there exists a sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` satisfying the given conditions. The program also handles the case where no such `m` exists and outputs `-1` in that case.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.
