Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value m such that you can split the array into exactly k subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to m.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest possible value of m. It first finds the maximum possible value of m by calling func_1(1, i * n) in a loop from n to 1. If the returned value r is less than or equal to n, it means that the maximum possible value of m is i, and the program breaks the loop.

Then, the program iterates from n // k to 1 and checks if the current value i multiplied by the maximum possible value max_val is a valid value of m. It does this by calling func_1(p + 1, m) in a loop from 1 to k and checks if the returned value p is equal to n. If it is, the program calls func_2(m) to print the answer and returns.

If the program cannot find a valid value of m, it calls func_2(-1) to print -1 as the answer.

The program uses sys.stdout.flush() to flush the output buffer after printing each query or answer, which is necessary to ensure that the output is printed immediately.

The program also uses assert statements to check if the returned value r is equal to n when the maximum possible value of m is found. This is a good practice to ensure that the program is working correctly.

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the binary search approach to solve the problem.
