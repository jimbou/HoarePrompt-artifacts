Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. 

`func_1` is used to make a query to the judge system. It takes two parameters `l` and `x` and prints a query in the format `? l x`. It then reads the response from the judge system and returns it.

`func_2` is used to submit the answer to the judge system. It takes one parameter `m` and prints the answer in the format `! m`. It then reads the response from the judge system and asserts that it is 1.

`func_3` is the main function that solves the problem. It first reads the input `n` and `k` from the judge system. It then iterates from `n` to 1 and makes a query to the judge system to find the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, n) = max_val * n`. 

After finding `max_val`, it iterates from `n // k` to 1 and makes queries to the judge system to find the largest value `m` such that `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m`. If it finds such a value `m`, it submits the answer to the judge system using `func_2`. If it cannot find such a value `m`, it submits -1 as the answer.

`func_4` is the main function that reads the number of test cases `t` from the judge system and calls `func_3` for each test case.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value `m` such that `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m`. This approach ensures that the program makes at most `2 * n` queries to the judge system, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is correct and should be able to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
