Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case when the maximum value `max_val` is not found in the first iteration of the loop in `func_3()`. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct value of `m` and will incorrectly output `-1`.

For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 2`. The hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will first try to find the maximum value `max_val` by calling `func_1(1, i * n)` for `i` ranging from `5` to `1`. However, since `max_val` is not found in the first iteration, the program will not be able to find the correct value of `m` and will incorrectly output `-1`.

To fix this issue, the program should continue to iterate until it finds the correct value of `max_val` or until it has tried all possible values of `i`.
