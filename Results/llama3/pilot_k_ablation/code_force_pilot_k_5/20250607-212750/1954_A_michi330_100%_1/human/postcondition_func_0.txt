This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, m, and k. It then determines whether a certain condition is met, specifically whether n is less than or equal to k or n minus the ceiling of n divided by m is less than or equal to k. If the condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
