Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` correctly checks whether Bob can make all parts have the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and printing the corresponding result.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
