Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if it's possible for Bob to make all parts have the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` is correct because it calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color, assuming that Alice paints the ribbon in the most efficient way possible to prevent Bob from making all parts have the same color.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and scenarios, including edge cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` are 1.
