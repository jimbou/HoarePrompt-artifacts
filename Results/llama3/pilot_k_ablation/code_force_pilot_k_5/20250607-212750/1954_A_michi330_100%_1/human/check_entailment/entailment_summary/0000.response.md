Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks whether Bob can make all parts of the ribbon have the same color by repainting at most k parts. If this condition is true, it means that Bob can make all parts have the same color, so the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it means that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the program prints 'Yes'.

The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` is correct because it calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with a different color to prevent Bob from making all parts have the same color. By subtracting this value from n, the program effectively checks whether Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts have the same color.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases where n is less than or equal to k, in which case Bob can always make all parts have the same color by repainting all parts.

Correctness: **True**
