Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. Additionally, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than `k`, and 'Yes' is printed**
