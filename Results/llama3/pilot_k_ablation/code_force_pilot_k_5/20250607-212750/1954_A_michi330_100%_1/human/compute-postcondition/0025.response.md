Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 3, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and stdin contains `t-7` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the next three integers from the input, and the stdin now contains `t-7` lines, each containing three integers. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
