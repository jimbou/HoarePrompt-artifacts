Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. The current value of `n` is either less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, and 'NO' is printed**
