The only variable in the loop head is `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `itest` and `t`. If `itest` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1, so `itest` is 1 and `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers.**
