The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into three parts, and assigns the integer values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively.

In the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, and stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= `m`, `k` <= `n` <= 50).

After executing the code, the first line from stdin is read, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged.

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and one line is read from stdin, the remaining number of lines in stdin is `t-1`.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers.**
