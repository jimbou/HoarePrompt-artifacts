To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `itest` is not defined, so we need to initialize it to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
