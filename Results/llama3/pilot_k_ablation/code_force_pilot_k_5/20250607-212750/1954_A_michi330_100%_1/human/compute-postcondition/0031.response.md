The only variables in the loop head are variables  itest and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `itest` and `t`. If `itest` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 3, `t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1 (because of the step 1 in the range function) and `t` remains the same.
State: **`t` is an integer between 4 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and stdin contains `t-8` lines, each containing three integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**
