Output State: **`t` is an integer between 4 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and stdin contains `t-9` lines, each containing three integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t` and `itest` remain the same. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the next three integers from the input. The stdin now contains `t-9` lines, each containing three integers. The conditions that `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n` still hold.
