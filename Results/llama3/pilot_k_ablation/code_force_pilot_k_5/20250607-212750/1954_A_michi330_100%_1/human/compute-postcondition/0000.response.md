The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
