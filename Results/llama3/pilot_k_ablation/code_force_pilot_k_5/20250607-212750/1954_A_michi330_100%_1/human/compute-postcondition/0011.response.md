Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to be the three integers read from the input, which are between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers, since one line has been read and processed.
