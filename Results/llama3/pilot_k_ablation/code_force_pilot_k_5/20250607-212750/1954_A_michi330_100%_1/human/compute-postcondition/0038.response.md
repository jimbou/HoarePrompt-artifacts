Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains 0 lines. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `itest` will have reached the value of `t-1`, which is the last iteration of the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will have been assigned the values of the last three integers from the input, and the standard input will be empty, containing 0 lines. The loop will have printed either 'NO' or 'Yes' for each iteration, depending on the conditions specified in the loop body.
