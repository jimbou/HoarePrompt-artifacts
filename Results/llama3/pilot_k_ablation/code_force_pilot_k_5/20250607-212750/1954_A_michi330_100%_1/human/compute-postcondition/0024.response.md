To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `itest` is less than `t`. Since `itest` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to increment `itest` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 3, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-6` lines, each containing three integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**
