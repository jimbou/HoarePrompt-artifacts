Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the integers read from the input, which are between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers, as one line has been read to update the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
