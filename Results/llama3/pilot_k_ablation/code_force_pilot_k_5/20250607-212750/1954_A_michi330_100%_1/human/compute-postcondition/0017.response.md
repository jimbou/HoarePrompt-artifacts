The only variable in the loop head is `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `itest` and `t`. If `itest` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1 (since the step is 1) and `t` must be greater than 1. Since `t` is already greater than 1, no change is needed for `t`. However, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**
