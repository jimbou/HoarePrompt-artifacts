Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 4 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` and `k` are less than or equal to `n`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and stdin contains `t-9` lines, each containing three integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.***
