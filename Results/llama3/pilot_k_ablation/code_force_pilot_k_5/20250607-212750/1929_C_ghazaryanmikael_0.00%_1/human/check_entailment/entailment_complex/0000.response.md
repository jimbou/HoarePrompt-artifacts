Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2.  It initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will be used to calculate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win.
3.  The program then enters a loop that runs `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses allowed. In each iteration, it calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to bet to guarantee a win in the next round, which is `s // (k - 1) + 1`. This is because if Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will have `s` coins left, and he needs to bet at least `s // (k - 1) + 1` coins to guarantee a win in the next round.
4.  After the loop, the program checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum amount `s`. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
