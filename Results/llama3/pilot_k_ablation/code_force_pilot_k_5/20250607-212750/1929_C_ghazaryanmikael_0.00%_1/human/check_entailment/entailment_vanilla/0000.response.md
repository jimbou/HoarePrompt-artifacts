Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described above. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that contains the main logic.
2. The function iterates over the number of test cases specified in the input.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input, representing the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively.
4. The program initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will be used to calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee a win.
5. The program then enters a loop that runs `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses. In each iteration, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee a win by adding the current value of `s` divided by `(k - 1)` (rounded up to the nearest integer) plus 1 to `s`. This is done using the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
6. After the loop, the program checks if the initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum number of coins `s`. If it is, the program prints "YES", indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct because it accurately models the problem's constraints and requirements. The loop calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee a win by simulating the worst-case scenario, where Sasha loses `x` times in a row. The final check ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover this minimum amount.

Correctness: **True**
