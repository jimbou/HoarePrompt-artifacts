Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + 2 * (`s // (k - 1) + 1`), `i` is at least 4, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 2 + 2 * (`s // (k - 1) + 1`), which is a more specific lower bound than the initial state. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
