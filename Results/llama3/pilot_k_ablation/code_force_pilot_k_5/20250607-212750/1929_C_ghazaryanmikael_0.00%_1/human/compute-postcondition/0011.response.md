Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `i` is 4, `s` is either 2 + 2/(k-1) + 1 + (2 + 2/(k-1) + 1)//(k-1) + 1 + (2 + 2/(k-1) + 1 + (2 + 2/(k-1) + 1)//(k-1) + 1)//(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or 3 + 3/0 + 1 + (3 + 3/0 + 1)//(1-1) + 1 + (3 + 3/0 + 1 + (3 + 3/0 + 1)//(1-1) + 1)//(1-1) + 1 (if `k` is 1), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: `k` remains an integer, `x` remains an integer greater than 4, `a` remains an integer, `i` remains 4, and `s` is updated to be either the original value of `s` plus the integer division of the original value of `s` by `k-1` plus 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or the original value of `s` plus the integer division of the original value of `s` by `1-1` plus 1 (if `k` is 1). The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
