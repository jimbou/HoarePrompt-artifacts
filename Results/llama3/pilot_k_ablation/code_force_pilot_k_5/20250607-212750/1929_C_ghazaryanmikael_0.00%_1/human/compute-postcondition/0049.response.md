The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to  `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**
