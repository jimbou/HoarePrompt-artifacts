Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is at least 3, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' still depends on the value of `a` being greater than or equal to the updated value of `s`.
