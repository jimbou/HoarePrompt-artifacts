Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the values provided by the input, which are integers. The value of `s` is reset to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin still contains at least one test case less than before, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
