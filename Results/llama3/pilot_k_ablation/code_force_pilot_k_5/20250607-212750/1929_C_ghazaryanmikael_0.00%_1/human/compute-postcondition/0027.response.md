Output State: **k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is either 1 (if k is 1) or s is increased by s // (k - 1) + 1 (x-1) times (if k is greater than 1), i is x, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + x/(k-1) + 1 (if k is greater than 1) or x + x/0 + 1 (if k is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `k` remains unchanged as an integer.
- The value of `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged as an integer.
- The value of `s` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, `s` remains 1. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `(x-1)` times.
- The value of `i` is equal to `x`.
- The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by at least one.
- The program prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + x/(k-1) + 1` (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x + x/0 + 1` (if `k` is 1), otherwise it prints 'NO'.
