Based on the initial state, the print statement will print 'YES' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it will print 'NO'.

The value of `s` is determined by the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, `s` is 1. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x-1` times.

The value of `a` is compared to the value of `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

Output: **'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'NO' (where s is either 1 if k is 1, or s is increased by s // (k - 1) + 1 (x-1) times if k is greater than 1, and a is an integer)**
