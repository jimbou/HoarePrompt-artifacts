Output: **k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is at least x + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), i is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s, int(input()) is greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s, where 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' is printed if a is less than s**
