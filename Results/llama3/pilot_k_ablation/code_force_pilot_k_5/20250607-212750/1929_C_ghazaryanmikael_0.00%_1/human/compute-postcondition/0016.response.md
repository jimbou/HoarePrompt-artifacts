Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is 0, i is x, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + x/(k-1) + 1 (if k is greater than 1) or x + x/0 + 1 (if k is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `k`, `x`, and `a`, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. Then, it initializes `s` to 0, overwriting its previous value. The values of `i` and the print statement remain unchanged.
