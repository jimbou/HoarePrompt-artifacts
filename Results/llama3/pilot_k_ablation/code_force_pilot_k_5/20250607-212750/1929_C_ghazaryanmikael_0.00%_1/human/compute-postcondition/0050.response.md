Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value, which was `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case less than before.
