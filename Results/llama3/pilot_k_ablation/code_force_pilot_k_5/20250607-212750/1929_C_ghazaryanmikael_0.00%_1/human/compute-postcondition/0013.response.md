Based on the initial state, the code will print either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the value of `a` and `s`.

The value of `s` is determined by the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` is calculated as `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1. If `k` is 1, `s` is calculated as `x` + `x`/0 + 1, which would result in a division by zero error. However, since `k` is an integer and `x` is an integer, and `s` is either `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), we can assume that `k` is greater than 1 to avoid the division by zero error.

Therefore, `s` is `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1.

The value of `a` is an integer.

The `print` statement will print 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'NO' otherwise.

Output: **YES if a is greater than or equal to x + x/(k-1) + 1, NO otherwise**
