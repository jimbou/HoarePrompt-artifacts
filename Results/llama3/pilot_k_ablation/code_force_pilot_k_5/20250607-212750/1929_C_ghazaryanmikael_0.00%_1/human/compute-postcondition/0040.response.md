The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4, `x` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least 5, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 5.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 5, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + 2 * (`s // (k - 1) + 1`), `i` is at least 5, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`**
