Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`, int(input()) is greater than 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 1, as it is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is still based on `a >= s`, but now `s` has a new value. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by at least one, and the input integer is still greater than 1.
