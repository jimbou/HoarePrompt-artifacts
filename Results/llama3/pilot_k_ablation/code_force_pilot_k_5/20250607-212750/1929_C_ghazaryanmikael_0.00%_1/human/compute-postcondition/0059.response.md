Output: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x` times, `i` is equal to `x`, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`**
