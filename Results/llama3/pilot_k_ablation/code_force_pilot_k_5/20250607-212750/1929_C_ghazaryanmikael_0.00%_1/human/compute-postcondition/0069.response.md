Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` twice, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` twice, and all other variables remain unchanged. The program has also printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison between `a` and `s`. The input stream has at least one less test case than before.
