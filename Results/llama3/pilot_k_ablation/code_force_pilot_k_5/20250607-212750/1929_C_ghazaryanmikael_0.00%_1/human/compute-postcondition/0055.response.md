The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `x` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 4.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**
