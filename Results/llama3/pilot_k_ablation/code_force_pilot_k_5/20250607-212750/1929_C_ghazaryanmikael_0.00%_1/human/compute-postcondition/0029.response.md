Output: **k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is either 1 (if k is 1) or s is increased by s // (k - 1) + 1 (x-1) times (if k is greater than 1), i is x, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + x/(k-1) + 1 (if k is greater than 1) or x + x/0 + 1 (if k is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s**
