To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `x` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes at least 3. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `x` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`, int(input()) is greater than 1, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1**
