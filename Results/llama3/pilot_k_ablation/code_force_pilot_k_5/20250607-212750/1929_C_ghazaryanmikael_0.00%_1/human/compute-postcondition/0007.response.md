Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is either 2 + 2/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or 3 + 3/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated based on the initial value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` is now 2 plus 2 divided by `k-1` plus 1. If `k` is 1, `s` is now 3 plus 3 divided by 0 plus 1, which is undefined in standard arithmetic. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
