Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has processed at least one test case from the input, and the result of the comparison between `a` and `s` has been printed as either 'YES' or 'NO'.
