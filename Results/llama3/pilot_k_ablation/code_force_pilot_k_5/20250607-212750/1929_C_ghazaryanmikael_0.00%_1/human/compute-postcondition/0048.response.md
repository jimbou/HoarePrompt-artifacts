Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to  `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case less than before.
