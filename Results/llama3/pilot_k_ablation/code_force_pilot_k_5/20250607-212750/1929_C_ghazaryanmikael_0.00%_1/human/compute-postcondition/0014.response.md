Output: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is either `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` otherwise 'NO' is printed**
