Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.**

The code increments the value of `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The initial state already specifies that `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, so the value of `s` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case less than before, and the printing of 'YES' or 'NO' is still dependent on the comparison between `a` and `s`.
