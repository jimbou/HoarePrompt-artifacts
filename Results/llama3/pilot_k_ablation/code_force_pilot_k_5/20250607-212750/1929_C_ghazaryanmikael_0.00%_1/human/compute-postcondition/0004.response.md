To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
