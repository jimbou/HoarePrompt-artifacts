Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` three times, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` three times, and the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case less than before, and the print statement condition remains the same.
