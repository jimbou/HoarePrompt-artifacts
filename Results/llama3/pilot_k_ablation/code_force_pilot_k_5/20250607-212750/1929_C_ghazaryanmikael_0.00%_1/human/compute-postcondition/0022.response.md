Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is either 1 (if `k` is 1) or `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` (if `k` is greater than 1) and then increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` twice, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` again, in addition to the previous increase. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has still printed 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed.
