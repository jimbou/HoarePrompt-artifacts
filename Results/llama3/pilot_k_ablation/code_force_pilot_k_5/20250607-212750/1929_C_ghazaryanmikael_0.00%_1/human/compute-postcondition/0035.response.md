Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`, int(input()) is greater than 1, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' and the input from stdin are still valid.
