Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers k, x, and a. It calculates a value s by repeatedly adding s // (k - 1) + 1 to itself x times. The function then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to the calculated value s, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
