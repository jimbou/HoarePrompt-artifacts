To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`**
