Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x` times, `i` is equal to `x`, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `k` remains an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop will execute 0 times if `x` is 0), `a` remains an integer (as it is not affected by the loop), `s` is the result of repeatedly adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself `x` times, and `i` is equal to `x` (since the loop iterates `x` times). The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing at least one test case less than before.
