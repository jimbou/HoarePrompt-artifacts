The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and stdin. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If stdin contains at least one test case, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain at least one test case.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is either `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), `i` is `x`, stdin contains at least one test case, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` otherwise 'NO' is printed**
