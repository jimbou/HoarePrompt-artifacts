Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` `x` times, `i` is `x`, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except for the following changes:

*   The value of `s` will be increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times.
*   The value of `i` will be equal to `x`.
*   The number of test cases in stdin will be reduced by at least one.
*   The program will print 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`, or 'NO' if `a` is less than the final value of `s`.
