Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is either `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `s` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` will be the sum of `x` and the result of `x` divided by `k-1` plus 1. If `k` is 1, `s` will be the sum of `x` and the result of `x` divided by 0 (which is undefined in mathematics but in this context, it means the loop will not execute) plus 1. The value of `i` will be equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times. The state of the input stream remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
