The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `x` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**
