Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x, and a, where k is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), x is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is either `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is either 1 (if k is 1) or s is increased by s // (k - 1) + 1 (x-1) times (if k is greater than 1), i is x, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + x/(k-1) + 1 (if k is greater than 1) or x + x/0 + 1 (if k is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is at least x + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), i is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s, int(input()) is greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s, where 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' is printed if a is less than s

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x` times, `i` is equal to `x`, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` `x` times, `i` is `x`, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s` , and this is printed: 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s or 'NO' if a is less than s




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
