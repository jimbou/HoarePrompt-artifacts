Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `i` is 3, `s` is either 2 + 2/(k-1) + 1 + (2 + 2/(k-1) + 1)//(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or 3 + 3/0 + 1 + (3 + 3/0 + 1)//(1-1) + 1 (if `k` is 1), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
