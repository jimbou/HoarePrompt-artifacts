The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is either 1 (if k is 1) or s is increased by s // (k - 1) + 1 (x-1) times (if k is greater than 1), i is x, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + x/(k-1) + 1 (if k is greater than 1) or x + x/0 + 1 (if k is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition a >= s, int(input()) is greater than 1**
