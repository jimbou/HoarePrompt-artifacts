To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `x` is greater than 1, it remains the same.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is either 1 (if `k` is 1) or `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` (if `k` is greater than 1) and then increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` twice, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**
