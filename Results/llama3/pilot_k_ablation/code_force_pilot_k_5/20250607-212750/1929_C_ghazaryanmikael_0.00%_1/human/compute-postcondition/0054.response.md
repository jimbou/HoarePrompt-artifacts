Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least one test case less than before**

In natural language, the output state is: `k` remains an integer, `x` is still greater than 3, `a` is still an integer, `s` is updated to be equal to its previous value plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is still 3. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by at least one.
