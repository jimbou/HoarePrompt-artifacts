Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `s` is either 1 (if `k` is 1) or `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` four times (if `k` is greater than 1), `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be either 1 (if `k` is 1) or `s` increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` four times (if `k` is greater than 1). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' also remains the same.
