Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 5, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + 2 * (`s // (k - 1) + 1`) + (`s // (k - 1) + 1`), `i` is at least 5, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the condition `a >= s`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has increased by the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1`, which is at least 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is still based on the comparison between `a` and the updated value of `s`.
