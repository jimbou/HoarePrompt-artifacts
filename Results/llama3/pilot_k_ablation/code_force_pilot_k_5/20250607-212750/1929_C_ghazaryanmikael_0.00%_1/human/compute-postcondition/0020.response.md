Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is either 1 (if `k` is 1) or `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` (if `k` is greater than 1) and then increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` again, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` + `x`/(k-1) + 1 (if `k` is greater than 1) or `x` + `x`/0 + 1 (if `k` is 1), otherwise 'NO' is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value, which was either 1 (if `k` is 1) or already increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` (if `k` is greater than 1). The other variables remain unchanged, and the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition involving `a`, `x`, and `k`.
