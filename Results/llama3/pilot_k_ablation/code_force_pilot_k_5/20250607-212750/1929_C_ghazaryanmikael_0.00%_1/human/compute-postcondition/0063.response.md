Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case less than before, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is increased by the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus 1. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by at least one. The program has printed either 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to the new value of `s`, or 'NO' if `a` is less than the new value of `s`.
