The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 2, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, stdin is empty. If 'B' is in x, the difference between the index of the last occurrence of 'B' and the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in x is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.**
