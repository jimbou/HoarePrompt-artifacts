Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a list of characters that contains the character 'B', start is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' in x, end is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' in x**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `start` and `end` based on the list `x`. The first line finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the list `x` and assigns it to `start`. The second line finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `x` by reversing the list and finding the index of 'B' from the end, then subtracts 1 to get the correct index in the original list, and assigns it to `end`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `x` also remains unchanged, but its contents are used to determine the values of `start` and `end`.
