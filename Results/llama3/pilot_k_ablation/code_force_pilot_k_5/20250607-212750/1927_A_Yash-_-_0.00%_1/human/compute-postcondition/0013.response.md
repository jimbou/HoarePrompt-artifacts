Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, start is an integer equal to the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in x, end is an integer equal to the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in x.**

Explanation: The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `start` and `end`. The first line finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the list `x` and assigns it to `start`. The second line finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `x` by reversing the list and finding the index of 'B' from the end, then subtracts 1 to get the correct index in the original list. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
