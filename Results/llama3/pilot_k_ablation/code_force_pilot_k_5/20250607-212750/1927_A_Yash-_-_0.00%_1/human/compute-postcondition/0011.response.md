To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t` and `x` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `x` is a list of characters. If 'B' is in x, the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.**
