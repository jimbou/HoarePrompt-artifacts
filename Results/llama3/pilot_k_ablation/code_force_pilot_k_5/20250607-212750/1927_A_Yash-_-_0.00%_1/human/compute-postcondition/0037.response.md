The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the list `x` to the variable `start`. The second line assigns the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the list `x` to the variable `end`. The last occurrence of 'B' is found by reversing the list `x` and finding the index of 'B' in the reversed list, then subtracting this index from the length of the list `x` and subtracting 1.

Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 4, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, start is the index of the first 'B' in x, end is the index of the last 'B' in x**
