Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, stdin is empty.**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `t`, overwriting its previous value. Then, it assigns the list of characters from the input string to `x`, replacing its previous value. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. After the code executes, stdin is empty because both input operations have been consumed.
