Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 3, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, stdin is empty.**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of `n`, `i`, or `x`. The second line assigns a list of characters equal to the input string to `x`. This line does not affect the state of `n`, `i`, or `t`.

The initial state of `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, and this value is not modified by the code. The initial state of `i` is 3, and this value is also not modified by the code. The initial state of `t` is an integer equal to the input value, and this value is updated by the first line of the code. The initial state of `x` is a list of characters equal to the input string, and this value is updated by the second line of the code.

Since 'B' is not mentioned in the initial state or the code, the difference between the index of the last occurrence of 'B' and the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `x` is not relevant to the output state. Therefore, the output state only includes the updated values of `t` and `x`, as well as the unchanged values of `n` and `i`.
