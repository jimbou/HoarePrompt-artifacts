Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, i is equal to n, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, stdin is empty. If 'B' is in the list x of characters, the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x of characters is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The variable 'i' is now equal to 'n', indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable 't' still holds the input value, and 'x' still holds the input string. The standard input 'stdin' is empty, indicating that all input values have been processed. The loop body has printed the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list 'x' if 'B' is present, otherwise, it has printed 0.
