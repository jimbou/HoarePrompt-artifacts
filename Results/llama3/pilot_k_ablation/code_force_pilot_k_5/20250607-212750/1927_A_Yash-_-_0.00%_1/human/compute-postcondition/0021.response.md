Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 2, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string, start is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in x, end is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in x.**

The code snippet assigns the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the list `x` to the variable `start`. It then assigns the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `x` to the variable `end`. The index of the last occurrence is calculated by finding the index of 'B' in the reversed list `x[::-1]` and subtracting it from the length of `x` minus 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
