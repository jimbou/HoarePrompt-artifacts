Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 4, t is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of characters equal to the input string**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of `t`. The second line assigns a list of characters from the input string to `x`. This line also does not affect the state of `x` because the input string is already equal to `x`.

The values of `n` and `i` are not modified by the code snippet, so they remain the same. The state of `t` and `x` is also unchanged because the input value and string are already equal to their respective values.

Therefore, the final output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to any variables.
