To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, we can conclude that `n` is indeed at least 1.

However, we also need to consider the state of `i`, which is the loop variable. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start. In this case, `i` should be 0, since the loop iterates over the range of `n` starting from 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `i` is 0**

Note that the state of `stdin` and the test cases it contains is not relevant to the execution of the loop, as the loop only depends on the value of `n`.
