The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

After executing the code, the value of `n` is assigned the value of the first integer in the stdin, which is t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The remaining input in stdin is still there, which includes t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases where t is equal to n, each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
