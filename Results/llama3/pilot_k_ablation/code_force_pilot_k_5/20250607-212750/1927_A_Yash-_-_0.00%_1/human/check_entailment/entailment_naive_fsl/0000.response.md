Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly solves the problem by finding the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string and calculating the length of the segment that needs to be painted white. The program handles the case where there are no 'B's in the string by printing 0. The program also handles the case where the string only contains 'B's by printing the length of the string.

The program uses the `index` method to find the first occurrence of 'B' and the `[::-1]` slicing to reverse the string and find the last occurrence of 'B'. The `len(x) - x[::-1].index('B') - 1` expression correctly calculates the index of the last 'B' in the original string.

The program does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It correctly handles strings of length 1, strings with only 'B's, strings with only 'W's, and strings with a mix of 'B's and 'W's.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and handles all possible cases according to the problem description.
