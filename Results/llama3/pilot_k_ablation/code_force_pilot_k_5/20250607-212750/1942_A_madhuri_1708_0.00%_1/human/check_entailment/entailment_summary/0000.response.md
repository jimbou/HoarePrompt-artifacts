Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where k is 1 and where k is greater than 1. When k is 1, it prints a list of numbers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted. When k is greater than 1, it checks if n equals k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k repeated k times, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted. If n is not equal to k, it prints -1, indicating that there is no array that satisfies the condition.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where n equals k equals 1, and it prints [1] as expected.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
