Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of n and k from the input.

If k is 1, the program prints a list of numbers from 1 to n, which is a valid solution because only one cyclic shift is sorted (the original array itself).

If k is greater than 1, the program checks if n equals k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k repeated k times, which is a valid solution because all k cyclic shifts are sorted (since the array is identical when rotated). If n is not equal to k, it prints -1, indicating that no valid solution exists.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. When k is 1, the program provides a valid solution by printing a list of numbers from 1 to n. When k is greater than 1, the program correctly identifies the cases where a valid solution exists (n equals k) and prints the correct output. In cases where no valid solution exists (n is not equal to k), the program correctly prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
