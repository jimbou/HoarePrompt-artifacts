Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n = 3 and k = 1. According to the problem description, the program should output a valid array a that satisfies the given conditions. However, the program outputs the array [0, 1, 2] which does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted. In this case, all three cyclic shifts of the array [0, 1, 2] are sorted, not just one.

The program only checks if k is greater than or equal to 2, and if so, it outputs either an array of all k's or -1. However, it does not handle the case when k is 1 correctly. It simply outputs an array of numbers from 0 to n-1, which does not satisfy the problem's conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
