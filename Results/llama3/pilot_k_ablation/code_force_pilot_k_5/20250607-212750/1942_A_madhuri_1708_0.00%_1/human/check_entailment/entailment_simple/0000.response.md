Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts. The program iterates through each test case, reading the values of n and k from the input.

If k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k elements, all of which are equal to k. This is because when n equals k, the only way to have k sorted cyclic shifts is to have all elements equal, resulting in k sorted shifts. If n is not equal to k, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

If k is less than 2, the program simply prints a list of numbers from 0 to n-1. This is because when k is 1, we can always find a valid array by having the elements in increasing order, resulting in exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly handles the edge cases where n equals k and where k is 1. The output format is also correct, printing either a list of numbers or -1 as required.

Correctness: **True**
