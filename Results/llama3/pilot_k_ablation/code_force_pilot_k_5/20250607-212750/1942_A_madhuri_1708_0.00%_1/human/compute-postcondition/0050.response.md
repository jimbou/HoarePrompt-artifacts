The `print(*[k for j in range(k)])` statement will print a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`. The value of `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

Since `k` is being printed `k` times, the output will be a list of `k` identical elements, each equal to `k`.

Output: **[k, k, k, ..., k] (where k is the value of k, repeated k times)**
