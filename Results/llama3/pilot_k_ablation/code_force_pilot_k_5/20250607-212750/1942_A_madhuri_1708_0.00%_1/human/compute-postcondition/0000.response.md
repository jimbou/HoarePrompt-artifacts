The only objects in the loop head are variables  s and open(0). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the open(0).  If the open(0) has at least 2 lines the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed  the open(0) must have at least 2 lines and the s is the second line.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), open(0) has at least 2 lines, s is the second line**
