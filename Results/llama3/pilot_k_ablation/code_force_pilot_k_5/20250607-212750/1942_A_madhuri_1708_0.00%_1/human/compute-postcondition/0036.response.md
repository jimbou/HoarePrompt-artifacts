Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is 1, the numbers from 0 to n-1 are printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, if `n` equals `k`, the value of `k` is printed `k` times. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
