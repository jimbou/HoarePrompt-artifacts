Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to n-1 is being printed, and either a list of k elements, all of which are k, or -1 is printed, depending on whether `n` equals `k` or not.***
