Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes each line containing two integers n and k, and prints a list of numbers or -1 based on the values of n and k. If k is 1, it prints a list of numbers from 0 to n-1. If k is greater than 1, it prints a list of k repeated k times if n equals k, otherwise it prints -1. The function continues processing input lines until all lines have been read from stdin, resulting in a series of lists or -1 values as output.**
