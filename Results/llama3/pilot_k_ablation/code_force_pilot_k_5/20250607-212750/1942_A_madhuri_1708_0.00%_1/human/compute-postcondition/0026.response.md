The only object in the loop head is variable  s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If the stdin has at least 2 lines the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-3 lines, each containing two integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-2 lines, each containing two integers.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-2 lines, each containing two integers.**
