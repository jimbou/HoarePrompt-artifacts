Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-3 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is being printed.**
