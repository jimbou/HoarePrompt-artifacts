Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-3 lines, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the second line of the input, which contains two integers. The stdin now contains one less line, as the second line has been read and processed. The rest of the input remains unchanged.
