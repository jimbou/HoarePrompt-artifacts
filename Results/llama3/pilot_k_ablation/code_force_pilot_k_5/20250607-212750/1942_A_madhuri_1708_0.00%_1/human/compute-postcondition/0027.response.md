Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values obtained from the input string `s`, which is split into two integers using the `split()` method and then converted to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
