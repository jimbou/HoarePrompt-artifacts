The only object in the loop head is variable  s and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 2 lines the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least 2 lines and s is the second line.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-2 lines, each containing two integers, s is the second line.**
