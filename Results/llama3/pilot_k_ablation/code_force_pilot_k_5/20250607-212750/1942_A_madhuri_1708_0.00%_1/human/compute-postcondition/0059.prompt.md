Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[j for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is 2 or more, if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are equal to `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to n-1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-3 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is 1, the numbers from 0 to n-1 are printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, if `n` equals `k`, the value of `k` is printed `k` times. Otherwise, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to n-1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to n-1 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
