Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the two integers read from the first line of the input. The range of `n` and `k` is still between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), and `k` is still between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers, since one line has been read and processed.
