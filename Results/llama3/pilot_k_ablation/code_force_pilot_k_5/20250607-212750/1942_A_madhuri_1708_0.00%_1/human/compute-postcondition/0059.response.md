Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the final state after all iterations. The loop has processed all the input lines, and the output is a series of lists or -1 values, depending on the values of `n` and `k` in each input line. The stdin contains no more lines, and the loop has terminated.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has completed its execution, having processed all the input lines provided in the stdin. The output is a collection of lists or -1 values, determined by the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop has finished its iterations, and the program has moved on to the next stage of execution.
