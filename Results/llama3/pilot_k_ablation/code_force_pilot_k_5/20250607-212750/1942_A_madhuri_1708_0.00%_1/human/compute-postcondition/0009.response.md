Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers. The current value of `k` is 2 or more. If `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are equal to `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.***
