The code prints a list of `k` elements, each of which is the value of `k`. In other words, it prints a list where the value `k` is repeated `k` times.

Since `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), the value of `k` can be any integer in this range.

Output: **[k, k, k, ..., k] (where k is an integer between 1 and n, repeated k times)**
