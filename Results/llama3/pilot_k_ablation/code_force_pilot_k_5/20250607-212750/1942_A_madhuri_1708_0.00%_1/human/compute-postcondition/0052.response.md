Based on the precondition, the code will print -1 if k is less than 2 or if n is not equal to k when k is greater than or equal to 2. Since the value of k is not specified, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **-1 (if k is less than 2 or if n is not equal to k when k is greater than or equal to 2)**
