The code prints a list of `k` elements, where each element is equal to `k`. Since `k` is equal to `n` and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), the value of `k` is also between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). However, it's also given that `k` is between 2 and `n` (inclusive), so the minimum value of `k` is 2.

Since `k` is equal to `n` and both `n` and `k` are 2 or more, the minimum value of `k` is 2. The list will contain `k` elements, each equal to `k`.

Output: **[k, k, k, ..., k] (where k is equal to n and is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), and the list contains k elements)**
