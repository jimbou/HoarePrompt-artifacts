The only object in the loop head is the file object `open(0)`, which is an iterator over the lines of the standard input. The loop will execute again if there are more lines to read from the standard input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least `t` lines.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to n-1 is being printed.**
