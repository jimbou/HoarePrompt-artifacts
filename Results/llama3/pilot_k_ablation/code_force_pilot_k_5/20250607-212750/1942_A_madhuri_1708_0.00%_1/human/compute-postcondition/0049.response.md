Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to n-1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the integers read from the first line of stdin, which contains two integers. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers. The conditions for printing a list of `k` elements, -1, or a list of integers from 0 to n-1 are still valid, but now `n` and `k` have specific values.
