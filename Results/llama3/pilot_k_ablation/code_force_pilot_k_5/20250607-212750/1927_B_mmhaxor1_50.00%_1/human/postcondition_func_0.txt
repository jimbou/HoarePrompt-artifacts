This function generates a string by mapping each number in the input list 'a' to a character in the string 'sam' based on the frequency of each number in 'a' modulo 27. The function takes a list of non-negative integers 'a' and a positive integer 'n' as input, where each integer in 'a' is less than its index. It returns a string 'res' containing the mapped characters.
