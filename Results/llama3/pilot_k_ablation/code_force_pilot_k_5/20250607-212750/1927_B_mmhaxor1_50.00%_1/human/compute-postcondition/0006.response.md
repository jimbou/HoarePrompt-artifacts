Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 1 except for a[i] which is mapped to 3, res is a string containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam plus the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam plus the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam, i is 2**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of a_map[a[i]] to beg. Since a_map[a[i]] is 2, beg becomes 2. The second line appends the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam to res. Since a_map[a[i]] is 2, the character at index 2 % 27 of sam is appended to res. The third line increments a_map[a[i]] by 1, making a_map[a[i]] equal to 3. No other variables are affected.
