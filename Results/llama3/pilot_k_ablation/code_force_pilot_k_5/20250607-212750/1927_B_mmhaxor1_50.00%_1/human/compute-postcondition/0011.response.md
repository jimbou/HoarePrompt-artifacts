Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to the number of times each key appears in a, res is a string containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam for each i, i is n-1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the initial state.
* The list `a` remains the same as the initial state.
* The string `sam` remains the same as the initial state.
* The dictionary `a_map` has keys from 0 to n-1, where each key is mapped to the number of times it appears in the list `a`.
* The string `res` contains the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` of `sam` for each `i`.
* The variable `i` has the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
