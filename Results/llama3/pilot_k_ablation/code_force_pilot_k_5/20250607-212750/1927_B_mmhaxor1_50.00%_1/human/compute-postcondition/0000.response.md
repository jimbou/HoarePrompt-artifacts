Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 0, res is an empty string.**

The code initializes three new variables: `sam`, `a_map`, and `res`. The variable `sam` is assigned a string of lowercase English letters. The variable `a_map` is created as a dictionary with keys ranging from 0 to `n-1` (since `n` is a positive integer), and all values are initialized to 0. The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables.
