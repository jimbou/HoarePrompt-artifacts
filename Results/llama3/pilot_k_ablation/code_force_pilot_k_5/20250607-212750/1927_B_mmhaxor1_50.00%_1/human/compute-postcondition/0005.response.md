The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 1 except for a[i] which is mapped to 2, res is a string containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam plus the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam, i is 2**
