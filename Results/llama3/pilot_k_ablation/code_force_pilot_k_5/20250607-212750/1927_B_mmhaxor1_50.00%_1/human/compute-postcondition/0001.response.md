To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we can set `i` to 0.

The other variables `a`, `sam`, `a_map`, and `res` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 0, `res` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
