Output State: **The program returns a string 'res' containing characters from 'sam' at indices calculated from the frequency of each number in list 'a' modulo 27, where 'sam' is a string of lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', 'a' is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, 'a_map' is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to the number of times each key appears in 'a', and 'n' is a positive integer.**
