To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 1 except for a[i] which is mapped to 3, `res` is a string containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam plus the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam plus the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 of sam, `i` is 3**
