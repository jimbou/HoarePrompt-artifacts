Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program sorts the array in ascending order, which ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The program then calculates the sum of these differences, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, the length of each array, and the array elements from standard input, and prints the maximum beauty of each array to standard output.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and leaving the standard input empty.

Correctness: **True**
