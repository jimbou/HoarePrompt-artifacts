Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved, as the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when the elements are in ascending order.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
* When there are only two elements, the beauty is the difference between the two elements.
* When there are multiple elements, the beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in ascending order.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or contains only one element, by not attempting to calculate the beauty in these cases.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
