Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements themselves.

3. The array elements are sorted in ascending order using the `sorted` function. This is the key step in solving the problem, as the maximum beauty of the array is achieved when the elements are arranged in ascending order.

4. The program then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension. This sum represents the maximum beauty of the array.

5. Finally, the program prints the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the code is clean and efficient. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
