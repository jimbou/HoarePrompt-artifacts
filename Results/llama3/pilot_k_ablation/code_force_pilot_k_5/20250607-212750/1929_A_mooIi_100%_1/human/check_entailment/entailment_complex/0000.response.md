Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive integers, and prints this sum for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It sorts the array in ascending order, which ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The sum of these differences is then calculated and printed for each test case.

The program also handles the input and output correctly. It reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements from standard input, and prints the result for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
