Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array is achieved when the smallest element is at the beginning and the largest element is at the end. By sorting the array, the program ensures that the smallest element is subtracted from the next smallest element, the next smallest element is subtracted from the next smallest element, and so on, resulting in the maximum possible beauty.

The program uses a list comprehension to calculate the sum of the differences, which is a concise and efficient way to perform the calculation.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
