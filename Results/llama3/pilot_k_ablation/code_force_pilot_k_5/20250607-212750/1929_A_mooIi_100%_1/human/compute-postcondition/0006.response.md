The code prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. Since `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the differences between consecutive elements will be non-negative integers.

The expression `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` calculates the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in the list `ar`. This is done for all elements in the list, starting from the second element (at index 1) up to the last element (at index `n-1`).

The `sum` function then adds up all these differences.

Since the list `ar` is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements will be non-negative, and the sum of these differences will be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output will be a non-negative integer representing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **a non-negative integer representing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
