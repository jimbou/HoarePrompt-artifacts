The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 3, and the input is unknown but must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 4, and for the loop to execute again, the input must be greater than 4.
State: **n is an integer, ar is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is 4, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is printed, and the input must be greater than 4**
