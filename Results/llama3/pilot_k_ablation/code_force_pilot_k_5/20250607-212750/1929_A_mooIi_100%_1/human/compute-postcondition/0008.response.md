The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than t the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 2 and stdin contains t-2 test cases.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 2, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed**
