Output State: **n is an integer greater than 4, ar is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is 4, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is printed**.

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer greater than 4, as specified by the input. The list `ar` has been updated to a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, as specified by the input. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 4. The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` has been printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables.
