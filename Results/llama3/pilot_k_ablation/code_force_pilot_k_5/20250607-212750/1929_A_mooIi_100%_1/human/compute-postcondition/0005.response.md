Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1**

The code consists of two lines. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` was initially an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, its value is updated to the newly read integer, which is also between 2 and 100 inclusive. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list to `ar`. Since `ar` was initially a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, its value is updated to the newly read and sorted list, which is also a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 1. Stdin initially contained `t` test cases, and after reading two lines (one for `n` and one for `ar`), it now contains `t-1` test cases.
