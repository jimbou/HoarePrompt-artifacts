Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
    print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 test cases, _ is 2, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is an integer, ar is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is 3, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer greater than 4, ar is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is 4, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is printed, and this is printed: the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
