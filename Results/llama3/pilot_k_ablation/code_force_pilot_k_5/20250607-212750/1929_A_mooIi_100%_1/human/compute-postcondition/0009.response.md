Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 test cases, _ is 2, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, its value is updated to the input value, which is also an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers from the input to `ar`. Since `ar` was previously a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, its value is updated to the sorted list of integers from the input, which is also a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

The value of `_` remains unchanged as 2. The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` is still being printed.

Stdin initially contained `t-2` test cases. After the first line of the code is executed, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. After the second line of the code is executed, stdin contains `t-4` test cases.
