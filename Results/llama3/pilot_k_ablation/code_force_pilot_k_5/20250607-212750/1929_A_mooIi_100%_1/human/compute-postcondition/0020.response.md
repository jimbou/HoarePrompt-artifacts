Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t-1, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions are true:

* The variable `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
* The variable `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
* The standard input (`stdin`) contains 0 test cases, meaning that all test cases have been processed.
* The loop variable `_` has reached the value `t-1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases.
* The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` is printed.

In other words, the loop has finished executing all its iterations, and the output is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` for each test case.
