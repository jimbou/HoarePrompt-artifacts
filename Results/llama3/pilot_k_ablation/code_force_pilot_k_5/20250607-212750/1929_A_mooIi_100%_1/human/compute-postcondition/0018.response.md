The code prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `n` is an integer greater than 4, the sum of the differences will be calculated for all consecutive pairs of elements in the list, starting from the second element (at index 1) up to the nth element.

Output: **the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
