The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the expression `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
