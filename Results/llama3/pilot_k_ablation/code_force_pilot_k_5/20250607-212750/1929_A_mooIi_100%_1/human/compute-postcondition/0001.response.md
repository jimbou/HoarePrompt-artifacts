Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, this value is within the specified range. The second line assigns a sorted list of `n` integers to `ar`. Since each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, this list is also within the specified range. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
