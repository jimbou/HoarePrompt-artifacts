The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least t test cases the loop executes again for the t-th time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has t-1 test cases, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least t test cases and the _ is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t` test cases, `_` is 1, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` is printed**
