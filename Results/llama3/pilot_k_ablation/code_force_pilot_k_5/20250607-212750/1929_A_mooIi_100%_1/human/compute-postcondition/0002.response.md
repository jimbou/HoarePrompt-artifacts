The code prints the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. Since `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the differences between consecutive elements will be positive integers.

The expression `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` calculates the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in the list `ar`. This is done for all elements in the list except the first one (since we start the range from 1).

The `sum` function then adds up all these differences.

Output: **the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
