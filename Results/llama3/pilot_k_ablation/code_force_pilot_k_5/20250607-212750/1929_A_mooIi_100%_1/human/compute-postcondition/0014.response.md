The code prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar`. Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the differences between consecutive elements will be positive integers. The sum of these differences will be the total difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `ar`.

Output: **the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar (which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar)**
