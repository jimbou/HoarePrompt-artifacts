The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains t-5 test cases, after this line, stdin contains t-6 test cases. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers from stdin to `ar`. Since `ar` was previously a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, the new list `ar` will also be a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, but its length may change based on the input. Stdin is now empty so we dont include it in the output state. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 3. The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` is not affected by the code and remains the same.

Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is 3, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar is being printed, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list ar**
