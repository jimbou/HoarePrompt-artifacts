Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(array, index)`: This function applies the operation to the array at the specified index.

2. `func_2(arrayForSuccess)`: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.

3. `func_3(inputarray)`: This function is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the array zero. It first checks if the array is already all zeros. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the index of the maximum element in the array (excluding the first and last elements), applies the operation at that index, and checks if the resulting array is all zeros. If the loop runs 100 times without finding a solution, it returns 'NO'.

However, there are several issues with the program:

* The loop in `func_3` runs a fixed number of times (100), which is not sufficient to guarantee a solution for all possible inputs. The loop should run until a solution is found or it is proven that no solution exists.

* The program does not handle the case where the array has less than 3 elements. In such cases, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should return 'NO'.

* The program does not check if the array elements are non-negative integers. If the array contains negative numbers or non-integers, the operation may not be applicable, and the program should return 'NO'.

* The program does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros. In such cases, the program should return 'YES' immediately.

* The program uses a global variable `answers` to store the results, which is not necessary and can lead to bugs if the program is used in a multi-threaded environment.

* The program does not follow the standard Python naming conventions for functions and variables.

* The program does not include any error handling or input validation.

* The program does not provide any documentation or comments to explain its purpose, usage, or logic.

* The program does not include any test cases to verify its correctness.

Correctness: **False**
