Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(array, index)`: This function applies the operation to the array at the specified index.

2. `func_2(arrayForSuccess)`: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.

3. `func_3(inputarray)`: This function is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the array equal to zero. It first checks if the array is already all zeros using `func_2`. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements), applies the operation at that index using `func_1`, and checks again if the array is all zeros using `func_2`. If the array is all zeros, it appends 'YES' to the answers list. If the loop counter reaches 100 without the array becoming all zeros, it appends 'NO' to the answers list.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- The loop in `func_3` has a fixed limit of 100 iterations. This means that if the array cannot be made all zeros within 100 iterations, the function will incorrectly conclude that it's impossible to make the array all zeros.

- The program does not handle the case where the input array has less than 3 elements. According to the problem statement, the array should have at least 3 elements.

- The program does not check if the input array is valid (i.e., if all elements are non-negative integers).

- The program does not handle the case where the input array is empty.

- The variable `answers` is not defined anywhere in the program.

- The program does not print the results. It only appends them to the `answers` list.
