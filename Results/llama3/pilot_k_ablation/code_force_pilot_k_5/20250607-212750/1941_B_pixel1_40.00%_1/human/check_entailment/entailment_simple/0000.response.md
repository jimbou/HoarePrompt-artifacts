Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ `i` ≤ `n - 1`) and assigning `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, and `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`.

The program uses three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` applies the operation to the array at a given index. `func_2` checks if all elements in the array are zero. `func_3` is the main function that iteratively applies the operation to the array until it either makes all elements zero or reaches a maximum number of iterations (100).

The program's logic is correct. It first checks if the initial array is already all zeros using `func_2`. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the maximum value in the array (excluding the first and last elements), applies the operation at that index using `func_1`, and checks again if the array is all zeros using `func_2`. If the array is all zeros, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If the loop reaches its maximum iterations without making the array all zeros, it appends 'NO' to the answers list.

However, there is a potential issue with the program's logic. The loop in `func_3` has a fixed maximum number of iterations (100), which might not be sufficient for all possible input arrays. A more robust approach would be to continue the loop until no more operations can be applied, i.e., until the maximum value in the array (excluding the first and last elements) is less than 2.

Despite this potential issue, the program's logic is generally correct, and it should produce the correct output for most input arrays.

Correctness: **True**
