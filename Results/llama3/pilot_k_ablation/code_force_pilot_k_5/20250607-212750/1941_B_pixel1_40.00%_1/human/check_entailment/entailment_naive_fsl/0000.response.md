Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation should subtract 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtract 2 from the element at index i. However, the program does not correctly handle the case when the element at index i is 1. In this case, the operation should result in the elements at indices i-1 and i+1 being decremented by 1, and the element at index i being set to -1. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, consider the input array [1, 1, 1]. The program will output 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because the operation can be applied to make all elements zero.
