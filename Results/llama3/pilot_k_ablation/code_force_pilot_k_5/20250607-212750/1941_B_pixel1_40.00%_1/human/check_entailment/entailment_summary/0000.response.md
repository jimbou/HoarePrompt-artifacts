Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Func_1 decreases the values of three consecutive elements in a list by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, starting from the element at the specified index, and returns the modified list. This function correctly implements the operation described in the problem.

Func_2 checks if all elements in the input list are equal to 0 and returns True if so, otherwise returns False. This function correctly checks if the array has been reduced to all zeros.

Func_3 determines whether a given list of integers can be modified to meet a certain condition (func_2) by iteratively replacing the maximum value in the list (excluding the first and last elements) with a new value (using func_1). If the condition is met within 100 iterations, the function returns 'YES'. If the condition is not met after 100 iterations or if the maximum value in the list is negative, the function returns 'NO'. If the condition is met before the loop starts, the function returns 'YES' immediately.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not handle the case where the input array has less than 3 elements. In this case, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should return 'NO'.

2. The program does not handle the case where the input array contains negative numbers. In this case, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should return 'NO'.

3. The program uses a loop counter to limit the number of iterations to 100. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that the array can be reduced to all zeros. A more robust approach would be to check if the array is still changing after each iteration, and if not, return 'NO'.

4. The program does not handle the case where the input array is already all zeros. In this case, the program should return 'YES' immediately.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input array contains non-integer values. In this case, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should return 'NO'.

6. The program does not handle the case where the input array is empty. In this case, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should return 'NO'.

Correctness: **False**
