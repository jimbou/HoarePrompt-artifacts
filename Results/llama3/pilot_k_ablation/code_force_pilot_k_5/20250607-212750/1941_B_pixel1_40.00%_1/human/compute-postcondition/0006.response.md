The code snippet assigns values to three variables: `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`. The `length` variable is assigned the length of the `inputarray`, which is at least 3. The `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` variables are initialized to -1.

Since the code does not modify the `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, or `loop_counter`, their values remain unchanged.

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1**
