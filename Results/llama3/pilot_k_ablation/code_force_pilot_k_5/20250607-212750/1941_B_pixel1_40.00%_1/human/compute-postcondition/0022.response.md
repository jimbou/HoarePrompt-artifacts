Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 4. If the element at index 4 in inputarray is greater than or equal to the highestNumber, then highestIndex is 4 and highestNumber is a non-negative integer. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
