To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop condition. The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes 4.

The loop condition is `range(1, length - 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. Since `length` is greater than 5, we know that `length - 1` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `length` must still be greater than 5, but we can refine this to `length` must be at least 6, since `elementIndex` is now 4.

The other variables in the state (`inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`length` is at least 6, `elementIndex` is 4, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `highestNumber` is the current highest number, `highestIndex` is 3**
