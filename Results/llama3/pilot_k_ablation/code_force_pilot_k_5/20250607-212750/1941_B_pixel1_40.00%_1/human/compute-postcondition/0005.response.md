To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `while loop_counter != 100:`. This loop will execute as long as `loop_counter` is not equal to 100.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative.
- `func_2(inputarray)` is False.
- `loop_counter` is 1.

The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`. For the loop to execute the first time, `loop_counter` must not be equal to 100. Since `loop_counter` is already 1, which is not equal to 100, no adjustment is necessary for `loop_counter` to meet the loop's condition for the first iteration.

However, to strictly adhere to the task's requirement of ensuring the loop can certainly execute one time based on the loop condition alone, we acknowledge that `loop_counter` being 1 already satisfies the condition for the first iteration. The state of `inputarray` and the result of `func_2(inputarray)` do not affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, as they are not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that ensures the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, focusing only on the loop head variable, remains unchanged from the given state because `loop_counter` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, and `loop_counter` is 1.**
