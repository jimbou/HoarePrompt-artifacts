Output State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `highestNumber` variable holds the maximum value in the `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, and the `highestIndex` variable holds the index of this maximum value. The `elementIndex` variable is set to the second last index of the `inputarray`. The other variables remain unchanged.
