To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement. The loop head contains the variable `elementIndex`, which is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 1 (since it started from 1 and was not incremented yet). For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be incremented to 2.

The other variables in the state, such as `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged, `elementIndex` is 2**
