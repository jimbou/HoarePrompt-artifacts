Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 6, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 6, elementIndex is 5, highestIndex is 5, highestNumber is the value of inputarray at index 5.**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, which is 5. Then, it assigns the value of `inputarray` at index `elementIndex` (which is 5) to `highestNumber`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
