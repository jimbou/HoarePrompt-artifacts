Output State: **highestIndex is 1, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[1], inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 3, and elementIndex is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `highestIndex` has been updated to 1, and the value of `highestNumber` has been updated to the current value of `inputarray[1]`, which is greater than or equal to the previous value of `highestNumber`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `length`, and `elementIndex`.
