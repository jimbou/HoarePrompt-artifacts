Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 6, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 6, elementIndex is 5. If the value of inputarray at index 5 is greater than or equal to the highestNumber, then highestIndex is 5 and highestNumber is the value of inputarray at index 5.***
