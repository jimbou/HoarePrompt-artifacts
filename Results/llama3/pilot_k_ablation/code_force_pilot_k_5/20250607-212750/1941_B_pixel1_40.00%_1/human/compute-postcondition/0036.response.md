Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 2 and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[2]`. Otherwise, `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.***
