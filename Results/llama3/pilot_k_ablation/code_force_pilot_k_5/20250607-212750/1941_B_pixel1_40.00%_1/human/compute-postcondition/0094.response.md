To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `length` is at least 4
* `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative
* `func_2(inputarray)` is False
* `loop_counter` is less than 100
* `elementIndex` is 2
* If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 2 and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[2]`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the objects in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`.

For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes 3.

The state of `length` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`length` is at least 4, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `elementIndex` is 3**
