Postcondition: ***length is greater than 5, elementIndex is 3, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is set to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
