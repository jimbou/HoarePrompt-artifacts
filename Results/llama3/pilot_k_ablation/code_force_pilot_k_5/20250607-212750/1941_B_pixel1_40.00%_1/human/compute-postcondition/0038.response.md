Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 4, elementIndex is 3, highestIndex is 3, and highestNumber is inputarray[3].**

In this output state, the code snippet has modified the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The value of `highestIndex` is now 3, which is the same as the value of `elementIndex`. The value of `highestNumber` is now `inputarray[3]`, which is the value of the element at index 3 in the `inputarray`. All other variables remain unchanged.
