Output State: **length is at least 4, elementIndex is 2, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestNumber is inputarray[2], highestIndex is 2**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, making `highestIndex` equal to 2. Then, it assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`, making `highestNumber` equal to the value of the element at index 2 in `inputarray`. No other variables are affected.
