To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `elementIndex`, `length`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if `elementIndex` is within the range from 1 to `length - 2` (exclusive).
2. Since `elementIndex` is currently `length - 2`, we need to adjust `length` to be at least 3 to ensure `elementIndex` is within the valid range.


The other variables (`highestNumber`, `highestIndex`, `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, and `loop_counter`) are not directly related to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.


State: **`length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100**
