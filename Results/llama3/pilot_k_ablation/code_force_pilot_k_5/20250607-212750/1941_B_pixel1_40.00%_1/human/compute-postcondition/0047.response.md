The only variable in the loop head is variable loop_counter, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable loop_counter.  If loop_counter is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, loop_counter is 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time loop_counter must be less than 100.
State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements), and highestNumber is the value of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements).**
