To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables in the loop head: `elementIndex`, `length`. The loop will execute if `length` is at least 3, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `length - 1`. Since `length` is already defined as the length of `inputarray`, and `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, we don't need to adjust `length`. However, we do need to adjust `elementIndex` to be within the range.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `elementIndex` is 1**
