Output State: **length is at least 5, elementIndex is 4, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestIndex is 4, highestNumber is inputarray[4].**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, making `highestIndex` equal to 4. It also assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`, making `highestNumber` equal to `inputarray[4]`. The values of `length`, `elementIndex`, `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, and `loop_counter` remain unchanged.
