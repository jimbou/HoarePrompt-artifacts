Output State: **length is at least 3, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is equal to elementIndex, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to be equal to `inputarray[elementIndex]`. The value of `highestIndex` is updated to be equal to `elementIndex`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
