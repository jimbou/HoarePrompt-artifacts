Output State: **length is greater than 5, elementIndex is 3, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestIndex is 3, highestNumber is equal to the value of inputarray[3]**.

In this output state, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the introduction of two new variables: `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The value of `highestIndex` is set to 3, which is the value of `elementIndex`. The value of `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`, which is the value of the element at index 3 in the `inputarray`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
