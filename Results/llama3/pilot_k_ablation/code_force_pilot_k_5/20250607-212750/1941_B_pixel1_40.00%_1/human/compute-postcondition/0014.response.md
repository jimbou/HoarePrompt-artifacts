State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, otherwise `highestNumber` is unchanged, `highestIndex` is 2 if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, otherwise `highestIndex` is unchanged, `elementIndex` is 2**
