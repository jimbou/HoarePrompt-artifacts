Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, and `loop_counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while loop_counter != 100:
    length = len(inputarray)
    highestNumber = -1
    highestIndex = -1
    for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
        if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
            highestIndex = elementIndex
            highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
    if highestNumber < 0:
        answers.append('NO')
        return
    newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
    if func_2(newArray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestIndex is the index of the maximum element in inputarray[1:length-1], highestNumber is the maximum element in inputarray[1:length-1] and is larger or equal to 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements), and highestNumber is the value of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray[1:length-1], highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray[1:length-1], inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
