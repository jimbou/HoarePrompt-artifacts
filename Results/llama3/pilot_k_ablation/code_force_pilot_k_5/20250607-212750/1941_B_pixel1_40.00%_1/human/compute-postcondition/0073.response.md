Output State: **length is greater than 4, elementIndex is 2, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestIndex is 2, highestNumber is equal to the value of inputarray[2].**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` becomes 2. The value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is assigned to `highestNumber`, making it equal to the value of `inputarray[2]`. No other variables are affected.
