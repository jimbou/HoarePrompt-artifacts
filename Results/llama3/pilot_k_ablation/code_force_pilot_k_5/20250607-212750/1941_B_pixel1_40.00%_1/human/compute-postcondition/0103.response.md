Output State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray[1:length-1], highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray[1:length-1], inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `highestNumber` variable will hold the maximum value in the `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, and the `highestIndex` variable will hold the index of this maximum value. The `elementIndex` variable will be set to the second last index of the `inputarray`. The other variables remain unchanged.
