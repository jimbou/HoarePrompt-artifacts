Output State: **length is at least 5, elementIndex is 3, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestNumber is inputarray[3], highestIndex is 3**

The code block consists of two lines that modify the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The first line assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, and the second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` becomes 3, and `highestNumber` becomes the value of `inputarray[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
