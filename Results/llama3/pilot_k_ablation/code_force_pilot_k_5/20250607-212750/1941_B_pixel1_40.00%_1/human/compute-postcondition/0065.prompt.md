Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2
Code of the loop:
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
        highestIndex = elementIndex
        highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 1, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 2, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is updated to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *length is at least 5, elementIndex is 3, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to inputarray[3] and highestIndex is updated to 3. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *length is at least 5, elementIndex is 4, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to inputarray[4] and highestIndex is updated to 4. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *length is at least 6, elementIndex is 5, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 5, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to inputarray[5] and highestIndex is updated to 5. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
