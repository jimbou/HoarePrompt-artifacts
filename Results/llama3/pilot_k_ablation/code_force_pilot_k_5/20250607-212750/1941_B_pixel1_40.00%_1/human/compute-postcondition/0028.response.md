The variable in the loop head is loop_counter, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable loop_counter. If loop_counter is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, loop_counter is 1, which is not equal to 100, so the loop can certainly execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestIndex is the index of the maximum element in inputarray[1:length-1], highestNumber is the maximum element in inputarray[1:length-1] and is larger or equal to 0**
