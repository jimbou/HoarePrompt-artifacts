Output State: **length is at least 6, elementIndex is 4, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestNumber is inputarray[4], highestIndex is 4**

The code snippet modifies the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The first line assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 4) to `highestIndex`, making `highestIndex` equal to 4. The second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` (which is `inputarray[4]`) to `highestNumber`, making `highestNumber` equal to the value of the element at index 4 in `inputarray`. All other variables remain unchanged.
