Output State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2**

The code snippet consists of three lines, each assigning a value to a variable. The first line assigns the length of the inputarray to the variable length. The second line assigns -1 to the variable highestNumber. The third line assigns -1 to the variable highestIndex. 

After executing the entire code block, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex are updated to -1. The value of length remains the same as the number of elements in inputarray. The other variables in the initial state, including inputarray, func_2(inputarray), loop_counter, and elementIndex, are not affected by the code and retain their original values.
