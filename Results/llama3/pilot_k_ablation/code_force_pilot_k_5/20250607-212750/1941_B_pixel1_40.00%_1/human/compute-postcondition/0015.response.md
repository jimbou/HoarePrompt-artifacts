Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestNumber is the value of inputarray[2], highestIndex is 2, elementIndex is 2**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` becomes 2. The second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` becomes the value of `inputarray[2]`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, and `length` remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the updated values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`.
