Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, and `elementIndex` is 1. If the value of `inputarray` at index 1 is greater than or equal to the current highest number, then `highestIndex` is 1 and `highestNumber` is equal to the current value of `inputarray[1]`. Otherwise, the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.***
