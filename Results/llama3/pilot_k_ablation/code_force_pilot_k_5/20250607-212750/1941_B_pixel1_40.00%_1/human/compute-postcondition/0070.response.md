Output State: **length is greater than 3, elementIndex is 1, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is 1, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100.**

The code assigns the current value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, making `highestIndex` equal to 1. It also assigns the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`, making `highestNumber` equal to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. No other variables are affected.
