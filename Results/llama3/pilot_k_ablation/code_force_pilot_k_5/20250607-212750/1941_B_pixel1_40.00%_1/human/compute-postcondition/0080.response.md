Postcondition: **`length` is at least 6, `elementIndex` is 4, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[4]` and `highestIndex` is updated to 4. Otherwise, no changes are made to `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`.**
