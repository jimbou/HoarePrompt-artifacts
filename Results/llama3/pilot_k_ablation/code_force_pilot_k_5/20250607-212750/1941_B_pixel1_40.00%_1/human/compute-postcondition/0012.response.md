Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestNumber is inputarray[2], highestIndex is 2, elementIndex is 2**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, making `highestIndex` equal to 2. It also assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`, making `highestNumber` equal to the value of the third element in `inputarray`. No other variables are affected.
