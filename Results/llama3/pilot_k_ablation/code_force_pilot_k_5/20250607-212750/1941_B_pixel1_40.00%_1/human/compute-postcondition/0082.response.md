Output State: **length is at least 7, elementIndex is 5, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestNumber is inputarray[5], highestIndex is 5**

The code snippet modifies the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The first line assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 5) to `highestIndex`, updating its value. The second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` (which is `inputarray[5]`) to `highestNumber`, updating its value as well. All other variables remain unchanged.
