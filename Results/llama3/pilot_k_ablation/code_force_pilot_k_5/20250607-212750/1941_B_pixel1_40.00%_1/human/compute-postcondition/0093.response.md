Postcondition: ***`length` is at least 4, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 2 and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[2]`.***
