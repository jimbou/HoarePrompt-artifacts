To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 2 and `length` is greater than 4. To execute the loop again, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 3. The value of `length` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still greater than 5 (since `elementIndex` is now 3).

State: **`length` is greater than 5, `elementIndex` is 3, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` is set to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
