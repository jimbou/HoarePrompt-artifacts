Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 4, elementIndex is 4. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is 4 and highestNumber is inputarray[4].***
