To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elementIndex`, `length`. The loop will execute if `length` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `length - 1`). 

State: **`length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `elementIndex` is 1**
