Output State: **loop_counter is 100, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, elementIndex is length - 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter has reached 100, the input array remains a list of integers of length at least 3 with all non-negative elements, and the function func_2 still returns False for the input array. The length of the input array, the highest number and its index in the array (excluding the first and last elements), and the element index all retain their values from the previous iterations.
