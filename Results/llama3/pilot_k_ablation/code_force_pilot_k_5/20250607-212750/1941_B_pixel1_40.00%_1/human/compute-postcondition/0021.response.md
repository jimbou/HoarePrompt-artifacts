The code snippet assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 4, `highestIndex` becomes 4. The value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is a non-negative integer, so `highestNumber` becomes that non-negative integer.

Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 4, highestIndex is 4, highestNumber is a non-negative integer**
