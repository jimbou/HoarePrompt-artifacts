State: **length is at least 5, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 5, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is 5. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is 5 and highestNumber is inputarray[5]**
