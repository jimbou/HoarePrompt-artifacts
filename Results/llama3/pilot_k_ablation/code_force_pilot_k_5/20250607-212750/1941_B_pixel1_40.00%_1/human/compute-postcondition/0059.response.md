To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`.

The only variables in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `elementIndex` and `length`. If `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 3, and `length` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be increased by 1, so it becomes 4. The value of `length` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, it must be at least 5.

State: **length is at least 5, elementIndex is 4, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to inputarray[4] and highestIndex is updated to 4. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.**
