According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `elementIndex` and `length`. If `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 4, `length` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be increased by 1, so `elementIndex` is 5, and `length` must be greater than 5.

State: **length is at least 6, elementIndex is 5, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 5, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestNumber is inputarray[4], highestIndex is 4**
