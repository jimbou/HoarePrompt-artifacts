Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestIndex is -1, highestNumber is -1**

The code snippet reassigns the values of `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`. The first line reassigns the value of `length` to the length of `inputarray`, which is already the case in the initial state, so this line does not change the value of `length`. The second and third lines reassign the values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` to -1, respectively. 

The values of `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, and `loop_counter` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `length` also remains the same, as it was already equal to the length of `inputarray`. 

The only changes are the values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`, which are now -1.
