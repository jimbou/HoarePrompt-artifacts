Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestIndex is the index of the maximum element in inputarray[1:length-1], highestNumber is the maximum element in inputarray[1:length-1].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `highestIndex` variable holds the index of the maximum element in the subarray `inputarray[1:length-1]`, and the `highestNumber` variable holds the value of this maximum element. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
