Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum element in `inputarray[1:length-1]`, `highestNumber` is the maximum element in `inputarray[1:length-1]`, which is less than 0, and `answers` contains the string 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'NO'.
