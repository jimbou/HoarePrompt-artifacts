Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `elementIndex` is 1. The current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`***
