Output State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2**

The loop iterates over the elements of the inputarray, starting from the second element (index 1) and ending at the second last element (index length - 2). In each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the highestNumber found so far. If it is, it updates the highestNumber and highestIndex accordingly. After the loop finishes, the highestNumber will be the maximum value in the inputarray excluding the first and last elements, and the highestIndex will be the index of this maximum value. The other variables remain unchanged.
