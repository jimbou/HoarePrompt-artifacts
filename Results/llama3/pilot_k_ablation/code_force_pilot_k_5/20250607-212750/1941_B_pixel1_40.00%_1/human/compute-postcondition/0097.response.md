The only variables in the loop head are variables  elementIndex and length, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `elementIndex` and `length`. If `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 3, `length` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be increased by 1, so `elementIndex` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `length` must be at least 5.
State: **`length` is at least 5, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 5, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `elementIndex` is 4. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 4 and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[4]`.**
