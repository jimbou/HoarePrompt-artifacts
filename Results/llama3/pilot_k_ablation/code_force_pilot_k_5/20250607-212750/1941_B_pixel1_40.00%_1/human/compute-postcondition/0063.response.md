The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `elementIndex` is 5, `highestIndex` becomes 5. The second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 5, `highestNumber` becomes the value of the 5th element in `inputarray`.

Output State: **length is at least 6, elementIndex is 5, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 5, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, highestNumber is inputarray[5], highestIndex is 5**
