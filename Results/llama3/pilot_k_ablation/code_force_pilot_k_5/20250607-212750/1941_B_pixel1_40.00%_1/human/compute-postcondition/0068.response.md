The only variables in the loop head are variables  elementIndex and length, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `elementIndex` and `length`. If length is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, elementIndex is length - 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `elementIndex` is 1 and length is greater than 3.
State: **`length` is greater than 3, `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100**
