To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 1, and `length` is at least 3.

To execute the loop again, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The value of `length` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `length` must be at least 4 (since `elementIndex` is now 2, and the loop condition is `elementIndex < length - 1`).

The other variables in the state (`inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 2, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `highestNumber` is the current highest number, `highestIndex` is 1**
