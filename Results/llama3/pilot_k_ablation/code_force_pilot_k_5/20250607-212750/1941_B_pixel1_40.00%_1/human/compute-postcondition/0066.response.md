The only variable in the loop head is loop_counter, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable loop_counter.  If loop_counter is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, loop_counter is less than 100, So for the loop to be executed one more time loop_counter must be less than 100.
State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in inputarray excluding the first and last elements, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2**
