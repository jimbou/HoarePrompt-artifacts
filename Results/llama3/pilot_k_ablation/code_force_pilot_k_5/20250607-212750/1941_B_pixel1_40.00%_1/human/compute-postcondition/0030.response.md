To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `elementIndex`, `length`, and the implicit state of the range object created by `range(1, length - 1)`.

Given the initial state, we know that `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute, the range object must have at least one element, which means `length - 1` must be greater than 1. This implies that `length` must be at least 3.

Since `elementIndex` is the loop variable, it will take on the values in the range object. For the loop to execute, `elementIndex` must be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 1.

The other variables in the initial state (`inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `highestIndex` is -1, `highestNumber` is -1, `elementIndex` is 1**
