Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 3. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is 3 and highestNumber is the value of inputarray[3]. Otherwise, highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.***
