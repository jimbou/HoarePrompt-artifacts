Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 3, highestIndex is 3, and highestNumber is the value of inputarray[3].**

The code snippet assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` becomes 3, and `highestNumber` becomes the value of `inputarray[3]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
