The code snippet consists of three lines, each assigning a value to a variable. The first line assigns the length of `inputarray` to `length`. Since `length` is already defined as the number of elements in `inputarray`, this line does not change the value of `length`. The second line assigns -1 to `highestNumber`, which was previously the maximum value in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements. The third line assigns -1 to `highestIndex`, which was previously the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements.

Output State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100, elementIndex is length - 2**
