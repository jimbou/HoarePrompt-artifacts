Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `answers` has one more element 'NO' appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is: The loop counter remains at 100, the input array remains unchanged with at least 3 non-negative integers, the function func_2 still returns False for the input array, the length of the input array remains the same, the highest number and its index in the input array excluding the first and last elements remain unchanged, the element index remains at the second last position, and the answers list now has an additional 'NO' appended to it.
