Output State: **length is at least 3, elementIndex is 1, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is 1, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100.**

The code assigns the current value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, which is 1, and assigns the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 1 and `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` becomes equal to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. No other variables are affected.
