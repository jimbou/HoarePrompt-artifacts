To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop condition.

The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `elementIndex` is within the range from 1 to `length - 2` (since the upper bound in `range()` is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 3, and `length` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1, and `length` must remain at least 4.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 4**

Note that we didn't change the state of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` because they are not part of the loop head, and their values are not affected by the loop iteration.
