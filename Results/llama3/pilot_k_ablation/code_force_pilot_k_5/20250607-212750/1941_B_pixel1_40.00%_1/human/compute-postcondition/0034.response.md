To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are:

* `elementIndex`
* `length`

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:

* `elementIndex` is 1
* `length` is at least 3

To adjust the states for the next iteration:

* `elementIndex` should be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2
* `length` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head

The other variables (`inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged**
