Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1
Code of the loop:
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
        highestIndex = elementIndex
        highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is updated to elementIndex. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` is `elementIndex`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 3. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is 3 and highestNumber is the value of inputarray[3]. Otherwise, highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 4. If the element at index 4 in inputarray is greater than or equal to the highestNumber, then highestIndex is 4 and highestNumber is a non-negative integer. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
