The only variables in the loop head are variables `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `elementIndex` and `length`. If `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 4, `length` is at least 6. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be increased by 1, so `elementIndex` is 5, and `length` must be greater than 6.
State: **`length` is at least 7, `elementIndex` is 5, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[4]`, `highestIndex` is 4**
