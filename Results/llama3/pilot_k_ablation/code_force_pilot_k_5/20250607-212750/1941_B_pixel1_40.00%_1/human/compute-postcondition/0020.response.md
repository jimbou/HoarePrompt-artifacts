To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 3 and `length` is at least 4.

To execute the loop again, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 4. The value of `length` remains the same, which is at least 4.

State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 4, elementIndex is 4**
