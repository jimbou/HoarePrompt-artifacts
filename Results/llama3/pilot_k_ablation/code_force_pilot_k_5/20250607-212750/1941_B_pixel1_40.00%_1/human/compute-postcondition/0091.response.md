The only variable in the loop head is variable  elementIndex, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `elementIndex` and `length`. If `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be increased by 1, so `elementIndex` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `length` must be at least 4.
State: **`length` is at least 4, `inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `elementIndex` is 2**
