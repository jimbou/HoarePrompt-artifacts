Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`.***
