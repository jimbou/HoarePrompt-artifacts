Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, `func_2(inputarray)` is False, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` and is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` is `elementIndex`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.***
