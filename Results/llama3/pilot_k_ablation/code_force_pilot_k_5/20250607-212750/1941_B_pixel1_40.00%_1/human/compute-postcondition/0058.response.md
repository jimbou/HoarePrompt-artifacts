Postcondition: ***length is at least 5, elementIndex is 3, inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 4, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is less than 100. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to inputarray[3] and highestIndex is updated to 3. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.***
