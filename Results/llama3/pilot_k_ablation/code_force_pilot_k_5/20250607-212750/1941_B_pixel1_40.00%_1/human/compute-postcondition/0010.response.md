Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is updated to elementIndex. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber and highestIndex remain unchanged.***
