Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers of length at least 3, all elements are non-negative, func_2(inputarray) is False, loop_counter is 1, length is the length of inputarray and is at least 3, highestNumber is the value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is elementIndex, elementIndex is 1.**

The code assigns the current value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` becomes the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. The values of `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, and `length` remain unchanged.
