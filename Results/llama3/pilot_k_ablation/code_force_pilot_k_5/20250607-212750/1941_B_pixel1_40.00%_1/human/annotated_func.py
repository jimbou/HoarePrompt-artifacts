#Overall this is what the function does:Decreases the values of three consecutive elements in a list by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, starting from the element at the specified index, and returns the modified list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if all elements in the input list 'arrayForSuccess' are equal to 0 and returns True if so, otherwise returns False.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of integers can be modified to meet a certain condition (func_2) by iteratively replacing the maximum value in the list (excluding the first and last elements) with a new value (using func_1). If the condition is met within 100 iterations, the function returns 'YES'. If the condition is not met after 100 iterations or if the maximum value in the list is negative, the function returns 'NO'. If the condition is met before the loop starts, the function returns 'YES' immediately. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns nothing.
