Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing a tuple with the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 0, `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, and `char` is the first character of `s` which is either "(" or ")"**.

In this output state, the list `positions` now contains a tuple with the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`. The balance is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character of `s` is an opening parenthesis "(" or not. The position is 0, which is the index of the first character in `s`. The character is the first character of `s`, which is either "(" or ")". The other variables remain unchanged.
