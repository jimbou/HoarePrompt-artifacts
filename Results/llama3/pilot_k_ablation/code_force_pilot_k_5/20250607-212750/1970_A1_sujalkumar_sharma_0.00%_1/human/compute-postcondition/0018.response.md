To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `char`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 4 characters, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character in the string. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and `char` becomes the fourth character in the string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 4 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing four tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, the third tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the third parenthesis in `s`, and the fourth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fourth parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 3, `char` is the fourth character in the string, and `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or decreased by 1 if `char` is ')'**
