Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is the length of s, balance is 0, positions is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if char == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1
    positions.append((balance, i, char))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing a tuple with the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 0, `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, and `char` is the first character of `s` which is either "(" or ")"

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, and the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 1. If the second character of `s` is "(", then `balance` is either 2 or 0 and `char` is "(". If the second character of `s` is ")", then `balance` is either 0 or -2 and `char` is ")"

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 3 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, and the third tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the third parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in the string, and `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or decreased by 1 if `char` is ')'.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 4 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing five tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, the third tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the third parenthesis in `s`, the fourth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fourth parenthesis in `s`, and the fifth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fifth parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 3, `char` is the fourth character in the string, and `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or remains the same as its previous value if `char` is ')'.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 5 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing six tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, the third tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the third parenthesis in `s`, the fourth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fourth parenthesis in `s`, the fifth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fifth parenthesis in `s`, the sixth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fifth parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 4, `char` is the fifth character in the string, and `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or remains the same as its previous value if `char` is ')'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
