Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 4 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing four tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, the third tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the third parenthesis in `s`, and the fourth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fourth parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 3, `char` is the fourth character in the string, and `balance` is either decreased by 1 from its previous value if `char` is ')', or remains the same if `char` is '('**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `balance` variable has been decreased by 1 if the fourth character in the string is ')', or remains the same if the fourth character is '('. The other variables remain unchanged.
