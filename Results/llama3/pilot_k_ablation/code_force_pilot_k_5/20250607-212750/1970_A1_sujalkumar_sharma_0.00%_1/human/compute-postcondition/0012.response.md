Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, and the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 1. If the second character of `s` is "(", then `balance` is either 2 or 0 and `char` is "(". If the second character of `s` is ")", then `balance` is either 0 or -2 and `char` is ")"**

In this output state, the list `positions` has been updated to include the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`. The balance is either 2 or 0 if the second character is "(", or 0 or -2 if the second character is ")". The position is 1, and the character is either "(" or ")" depending on the second character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
