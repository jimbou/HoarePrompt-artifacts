Functionality: **This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input and returns a string consisting of the same characters, sorted by their balance and then by their position in descending order. The function processes the input string, tracking the balance of parentheses and their positions, and then sorts the characters based on this information. The resulting string contains the same characters as the input, but in a sorted order.**
