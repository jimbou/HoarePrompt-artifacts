Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 5 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing six tuples: the first tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the first parenthesis in `s`, the second tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the second parenthesis in `s`, the third tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the third parenthesis in `s`, the fourth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fourth parenthesis in `s`, the fifth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fifth parenthesis in `s`, the sixth tuple contains the balance, position, and character of the fifth parenthesis in `s`, `i` is 4, `char` is the fifth character in the string, and `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or remains the same as its previous value if `char` is ')'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains the same, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the list `positions` now contains six tuples, each representing the balance, position, and character of the first six parentheses in `s`, the value of `i` is still 4, the value of `char` is still the fifth character in `s`, and the value of `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or remains the same as its previous value if `char` is ')'.
