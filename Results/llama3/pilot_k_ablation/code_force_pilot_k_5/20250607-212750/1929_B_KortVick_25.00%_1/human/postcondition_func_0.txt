The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a square grid size (n) and a minimum number of diagonals (k) that should have at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition for each test case, based on whether k is even or odd. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
