Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program uses a simple mathematical approach to calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored based on the value of k.

The program first checks if k is even and if k // 2 is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints k // 2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints ceil(k / 2). This approach is based on the observation that if k is even, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is k // 2, but if k // 2 is odd, one additional cell needs to be colored to cover the remaining diagonal.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. The use of the ceil function to round up the division result when k is odd ensures that the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is always calculated correctly.

Correctness: **True**
