Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.

The program first checks if k is even and k // 2 is odd. If this condition is true, it prints k // 2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints ceil(k / 2).

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

- If k is even and k // 2 is odd, it means that k is of the form 4m + 2, where m is an integer. In this case, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is m + 1, which is equal to k // 2 + 1.
- If k is not of the form 4m + 2, then the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is ceil(k / 2).

This approach is correct because it covers all possible cases for k and provides the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in each case.

Correctness: **True**
