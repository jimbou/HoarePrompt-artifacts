Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.

The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid n and the minimum number of diagonals k.

The program then checks if k is even and if k/2 is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints k/2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling of k/2.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If k is even, it means that we need to color at least k/2 diagonals. Since each diagonal has two cells, we need to color at least k/2 cells.
* If k/2 is odd, it means that we cannot color exactly k/2 diagonals, because each diagonal has two cells. In this case, we need to color one more cell to cover the remaining diagonal, hence k/2 + 1.
* If k is odd, it means that we need to color at least (k+1)/2 diagonals. Since each diagonal has two cells, we need to color at least (k+1)/2 cells. The ceiling function is used to round up to the nearest integer, because we cannot color a fraction of a cell.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

Correctness: **True**
