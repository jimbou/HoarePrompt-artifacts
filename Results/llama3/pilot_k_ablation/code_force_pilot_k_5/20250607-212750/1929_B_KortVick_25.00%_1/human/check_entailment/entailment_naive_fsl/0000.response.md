Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 9, the program outputs 5, but the correct answer is 6. This is because the program does not consider the case where k is greater than 2n - 2, in which case the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is n.

The program only checks if k is even or odd, and if k // 2 is even or odd, but it does not consider the case where k is greater than 2n - 2. In this case, the program outputs ceil(k / 2), which is not correct.

To fix this, the program should also check if k is greater than 2n - 2, and if so, output n.
