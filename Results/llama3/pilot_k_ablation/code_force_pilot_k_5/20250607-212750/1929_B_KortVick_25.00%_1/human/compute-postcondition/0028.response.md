The code prints the ceiling of the value of `k` divided by 2.
Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k` divided by 2 will be a value between 0.5 and 2n - 1 (inclusive).
The ceiling function will round this value up to the nearest integer.
Output: **the ceiling of the value of k divided by 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 inclusive)**
