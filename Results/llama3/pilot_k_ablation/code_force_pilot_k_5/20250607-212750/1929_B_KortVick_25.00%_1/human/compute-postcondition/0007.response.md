The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `k`.

Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), and either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, we can deduce the following:

*   If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a decimal value, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round up to the nearest integer.
*   If `k` is even, `k / 2` will be an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be equal to `k / 2`.

However, since `k // 2` is even when `k` is even, we know that `k` is a multiple of 4 when it is even. Therefore, `k / 2` will always be an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **k / 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, and k is either odd or a multiple of 4)**
