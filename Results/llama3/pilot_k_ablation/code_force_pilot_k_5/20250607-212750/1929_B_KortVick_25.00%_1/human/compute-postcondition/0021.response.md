The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `k`. Since `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, the exact value of `k` is not known. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the ceiling of half of the second integer from the input.

Output: **The ceiling of half of the second integer from the input**
