Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-3`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are still within their respective ranges. The values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values from the input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
