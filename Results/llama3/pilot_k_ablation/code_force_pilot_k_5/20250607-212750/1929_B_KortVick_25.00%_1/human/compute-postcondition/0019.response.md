The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive).

Output: **an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive), where n is the first integer from the input**
