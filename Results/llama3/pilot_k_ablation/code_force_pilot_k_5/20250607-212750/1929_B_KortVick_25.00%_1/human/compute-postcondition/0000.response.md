Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), where the number of lines is `t-1`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` that satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. The values of `n` and `k` are not yet assigned to any variables, but they are still present in the stdin.
