The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `k`. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k` will be divided by 2 and the ceiling of the result will be printed.

Output: **The ceiling of half of the value of k (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 inclusive)**
