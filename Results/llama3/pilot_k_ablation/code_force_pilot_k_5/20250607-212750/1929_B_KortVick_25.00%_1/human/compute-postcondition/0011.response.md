Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin. The number of lines in stdin is reduced by 1, as one line is consumed by the input operation. The range of values for `n` and `k` remains the same, but the specific values are updated based on the input.
