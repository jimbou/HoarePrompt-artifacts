Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-4`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
