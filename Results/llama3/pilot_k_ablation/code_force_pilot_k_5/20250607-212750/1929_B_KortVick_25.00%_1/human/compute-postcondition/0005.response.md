The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the result of dividing `k` by 2 and adding 1. Since `k` is even, `k // 2` will be an integer, and adding 1 to it will result in an odd number.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`. The current value of `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, and the value of `k // 2 + 1` is being printed, which is an odd number**
