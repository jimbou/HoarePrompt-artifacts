Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-4`. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.***
