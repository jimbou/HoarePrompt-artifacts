The code accepts two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive) and `k` is between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive). The number of lines of input is `t-1`, where `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `k` are assigned to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`.**
