The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive).

Output: **The ceiling of the division of k by 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^8)**
