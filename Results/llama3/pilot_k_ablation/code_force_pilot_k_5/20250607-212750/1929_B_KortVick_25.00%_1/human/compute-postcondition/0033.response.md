The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2, plus 1.

Based on the precondition, `k` is an integer between 1 and `4n - 2` (inclusive). Since `n` is an integer between 2 and `10^8` (inclusive), the maximum value of `k` is `4 * 10^8 - 2`.

When `k` is divided by 2, the result is an integer between 0 and `2 * 10^8 - 1` (inclusive). Adding 1 to this result gives an integer between 1 and `2 * 10^8`.

Therefore, the output will be an integer between 1 and `2 * 10^8`.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^8**
