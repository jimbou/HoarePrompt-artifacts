The code prints the ceiling of the integer division of `k` by 2.
Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), and either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, the ceiling of `k / 2` will be an integer between 1 and 2n - 1 (inclusive).
Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`. Additionally, either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, and the ceiling of the integer division of `k` by 2 is being printed, which is an integer between 1 and 2n - 1 (inclusive)**
