Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), where the number of lines is `t-1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed, which is an odd number. Otherwise, either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, and the ceiling of the integer division of `k` by 2 is printed, which is an integer between 1 and 2n - 1 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is being printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k/2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`. If `k` is even and the integer division of `k` by 2 is odd, then the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-3`. If `k` is even and `k` divided by 2 is odd, then the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the smallest integer not less than `k` divided by 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-4`. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
