The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2. Where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive).
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`, and the ceiling of k/2 is being printed**
