Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-2`. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed, which is an odd number. Otherwise, either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, and the ceiling of the integer division of `k` by 2 is printed, which is an integer between 1 and 2n - 1 (inclusive).***
