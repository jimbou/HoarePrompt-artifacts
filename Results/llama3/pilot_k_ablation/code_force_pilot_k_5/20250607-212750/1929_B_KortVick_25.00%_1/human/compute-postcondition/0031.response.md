The only variable in the loop head is variable  `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 998 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where the number of lines is `t-3`. If `k` is even and `k` divided by 2 is odd, then the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the smallest integer not less than `k` divided by 2 is printed.**
