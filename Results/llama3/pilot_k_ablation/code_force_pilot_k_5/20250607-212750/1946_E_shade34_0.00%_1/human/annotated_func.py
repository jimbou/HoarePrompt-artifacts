#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.

        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer and the value 0 is also an integer and equals 0.

    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second value returned by the function `func_1` when called with arguments `b` and `a`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`. `c` is the first value returned by the same function call.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and the negative of the result of subtracting 1 from the integer division of a by b. Since a is a multiple of b, the integer division of a by b is equal to a/b. Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing 1 and the negative of (a/b - 1).
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` is a calculated value where `c` is also a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer not less than `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the result in reverse order. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -(a/b - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing the second value returned by func_1 and the first value minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second value returned by func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and the return value 'c' of function func_1(b, 1000000007), modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' as input and returns the product of 'a' and the result of function func_1(b, 1000000007), modulo 1000000007. The function does not modify the input variables 'a' and 'b'. The output is a non-negative integer.
