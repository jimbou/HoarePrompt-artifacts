Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `1000000007`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`. The values of `c` and `d` are now dependent on the output of the function `func_1` for the given inputs.
