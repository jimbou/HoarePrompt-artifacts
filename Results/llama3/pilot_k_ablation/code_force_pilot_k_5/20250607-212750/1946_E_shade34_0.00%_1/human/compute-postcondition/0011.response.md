Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` is a calculated value where `c` is also a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer not less than `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.**
