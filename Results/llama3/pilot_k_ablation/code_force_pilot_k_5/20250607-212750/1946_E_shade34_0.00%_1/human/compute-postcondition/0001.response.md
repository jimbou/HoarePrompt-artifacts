Output State: **The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and the return value 'c' of function func_1(b, 1000000007), modulo 1000000007.**

In this output state, 'a' is a non-negative integer, and 'c' is the return value of function func_1(b, 1000000007), where 'b' is also a non-negative integer. The result of the multiplication of 'a' and 'c' is then taken modulo 1000000007.
