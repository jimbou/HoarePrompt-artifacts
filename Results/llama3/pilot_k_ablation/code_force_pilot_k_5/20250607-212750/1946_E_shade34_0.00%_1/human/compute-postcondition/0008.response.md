Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and the negative of the result of subtracting 1 from the integer division of a by b. Since a is a multiple of b, the integer division of a by b is equal to a/b. Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing 1 and the negative of (a/b - 1).**
