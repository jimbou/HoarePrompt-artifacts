Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is not less than `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are returned values from `func_1(b, a % b)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`, and assigns the returned values to `c` and `d`, respectively. The values of `c` and `d` are now determined by the output of `func_1`, but their exact values are unknown without knowing the implementation of `func_1`. The conditions that `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b` are still valid, as the code does not change these relationships.
