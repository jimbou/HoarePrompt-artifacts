Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums, but the provided code does not implement this logic. It appears to be implementing a different problem, possibly related to modular arithmetic.

The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to finding modular inverses or performing modular arithmetic operations. However, there is no clear connection between these functions and the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

To correctly solve the problem, the code would need to be rewritten to take into account the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. Without this logic, the program is incorrect.
