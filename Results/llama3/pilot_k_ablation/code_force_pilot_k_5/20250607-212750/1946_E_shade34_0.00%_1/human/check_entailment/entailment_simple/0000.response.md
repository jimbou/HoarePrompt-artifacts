Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program uses the mathematical concept of combinations and modular arithmetic to efficiently calculate the result.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0, indicating that there are no valid permutations.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums. For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of combinations of the remaining elements and multiplies it with the result. For each prefix maximum, it calculates the number of combinations of the remaining elements and multiplies it with the result.

The program uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse, which is used to calculate the combinations. The `func_2` function is used to calculate the combinations.

The program correctly handles the case where the input values are large by using modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
