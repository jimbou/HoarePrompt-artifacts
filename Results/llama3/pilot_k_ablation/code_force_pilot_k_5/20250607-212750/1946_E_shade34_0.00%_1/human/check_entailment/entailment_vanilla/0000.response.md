Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Function 1, `func_1(a, b)`, is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b`. This function is used to handle the case where `a` is not coprime with the modulus `1000000007`.

Function 2, `func_2(a, b)`, is used to calculate the modular multiplication of `a` and the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

The main logic of the program is not provided, but based on the given functions, it seems that the program is designed to calculate the number of permutations using the modular arithmetic.

However, without the main logic of the program, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the program.

But, assuming that the main logic of the program is correct and it uses the provided functions correctly, the program should be able to calculate the correct number of permutations.

Therefore, based on the provided functions, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
