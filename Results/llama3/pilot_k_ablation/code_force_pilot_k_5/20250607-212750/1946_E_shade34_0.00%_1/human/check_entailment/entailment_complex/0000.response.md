Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Function func_1 is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'b' modulo 1000000007. This function uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are then used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse.

Function func_2 uses the result of func_1 to calculate the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and the modular multiplicative inverse of 'b' modulo 1000000007.

The main program calculates the number of suitable permutations by iterating over the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and using func_2 to calculate the product of the factorial of the remaining elements and the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of the current element.

The program correctly handles the cases where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match, or where the prefix maximums or suffix maximums are not in increasing order. In these cases, the program prints 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem, and the functions func_1 and func_2 are correctly implemented to perform the necessary calculations.

Correctness: **True**
