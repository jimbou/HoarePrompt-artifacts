Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first calculates the factorial of numbers up to 200002 and stores them in the `facts` list. This is done to efficiently calculate the binomial coefficients later.

2. The program then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

3. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums from the input.

4. The program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, indicating that there are no suitable permutations.

5. If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function. This function calculates the binomial coefficient `n-1 choose x-1` for each suffix maximum `x`, where `n` is the length of the permutation. The binomial coefficient is calculated using the `func_1` function, which calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.

6. The program then calculates the number of suitable permutations for the prefix maximums in a similar way.

7. Finally, the program prints the total number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are correctly implemented based on their execution summaries. The `func_1` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the extended Euclidean algorithm, and the `func_2` function calculates the binomial coefficient using the `func_1` function.

Overall, the program correctly implements the algorithm to calculate the number of suitable permutations based on the given problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.
