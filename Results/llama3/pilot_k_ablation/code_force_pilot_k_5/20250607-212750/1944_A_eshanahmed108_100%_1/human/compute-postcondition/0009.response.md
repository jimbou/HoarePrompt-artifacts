Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers input from the stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Since one test case has been processed, the number of test cases remaining in the stdin is reduced by 1.
