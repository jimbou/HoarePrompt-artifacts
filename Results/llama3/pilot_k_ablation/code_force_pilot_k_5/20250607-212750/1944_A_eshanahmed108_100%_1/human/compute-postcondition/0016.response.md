The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`.  If the `int(input())` is greater than 0 the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `n` and `k` are integers that were previously in stdin and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and this is printed: n if n - k > 1 else 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is 4.
State: **`_` is 4, `n` and `k` are integers that were previously in stdin and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and this is printed: n if n - k > 1 else 1**
