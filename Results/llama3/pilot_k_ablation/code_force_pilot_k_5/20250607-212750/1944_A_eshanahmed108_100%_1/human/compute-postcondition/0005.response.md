Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 1, and the value of `n` if `n - k > 1` otherwise 1 is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the integers read from the input, and the value of `_` remains 1. The condition `n - k > 1` is still being evaluated, and if true, the value of `n` is being printed; otherwise, 1 is being printed. The stdin now contains one less test case.
