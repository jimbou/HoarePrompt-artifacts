The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is greater than 1, otherwise it prints 1. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `n` or 1.

Output: **n if n - k > 1, otherwise 1 (where n and k are integers)**
