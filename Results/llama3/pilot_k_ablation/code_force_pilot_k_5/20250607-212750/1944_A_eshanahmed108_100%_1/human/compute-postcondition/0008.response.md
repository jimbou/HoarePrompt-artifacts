The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, and the number of test cases is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 2, and the number of test cases must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 2, and the value of `n` if `n - k > 1` otherwise 1 is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**
