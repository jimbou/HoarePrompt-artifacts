Output State: **`_` is 4, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 4. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the next two integers from the input, which were previously in stdin. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, the number of test cases is reduced by 1 after reading `n` and `k`.
