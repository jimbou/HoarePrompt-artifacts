The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() function must return at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input() function must return at least 1, _ is 0**
