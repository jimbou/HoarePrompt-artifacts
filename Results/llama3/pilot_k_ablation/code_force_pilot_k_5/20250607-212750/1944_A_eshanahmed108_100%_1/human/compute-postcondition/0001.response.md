Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are integers because `map(int, input().split())` converts the input to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but since one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, there is one less test case remaining. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
