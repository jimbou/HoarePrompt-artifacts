The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is greater than 1, otherwise it prints 1. Since `n` and `k` are integers that were previously in stdin, their exact values are not provided. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `n` or 1, depending on the condition `n - k > 1`.

Output: **n if n - k > 1, otherwise 1 (where n and k are integers that were previously in stdin)**
