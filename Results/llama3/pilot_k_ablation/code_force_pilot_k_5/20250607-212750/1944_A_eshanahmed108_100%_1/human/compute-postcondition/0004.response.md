To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable that takes on the values in the range generated by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer
* `k` is an integer
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `_` is 0, and the value of `n` if `n - k > 1` otherwise 1 is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what values `_` can take on in the next iteration. Since `_` is an iteration variable, it will take on the next value in the range generated by `int(input())`.

However, we don't have any information about the specific values in the range or how they are generated. All we know is that `_` will take on the next value in the range.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `_`. Since `_` is an iteration variable, it will increment by 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `_` is 1, and the value of `n` if `n - k > 1` otherwise 1 is being printed**
