To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ls` is a list of n-3 integers, `last` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `other` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `last` and `other` which is between 2 and 2*10^9 is being printed**
