Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500, i is 4, stdin contains t-6 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100, ls is a list of n-6 integers, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is between 2 and 2*10^9**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, from `t-5` to `t-6`, as one test case is consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 100, as it is assigned the value of the input. The list `ls` is updated to contain `n-6` integers, as one integer is popped from the list and assigned to `last`, and another integer is popped and assigned to `other`. The values of `last` and `other` are updated to integers between 1 and 10^9, and their sum remains between 2 and 2*10^9.
