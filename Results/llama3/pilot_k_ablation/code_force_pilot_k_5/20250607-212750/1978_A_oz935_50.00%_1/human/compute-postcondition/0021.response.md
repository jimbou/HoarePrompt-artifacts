Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500, t is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to t, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100, ls is an empty list, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is between 2 and 2*10^9, and the sum of last and other is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the number of test cases initially provided, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `t`, there will be no more test cases left in the standard input, the list `ls` will be empty, and the variables `last` and `other` will hold the last and second-largest numbers of the last test case, respectively. The sum of `last` and `other` will be printed, and this sum will be between 2 and 2*10^9.
