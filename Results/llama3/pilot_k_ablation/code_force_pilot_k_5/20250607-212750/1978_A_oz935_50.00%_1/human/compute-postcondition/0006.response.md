Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500, t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100, ls is a list of n-3 integers, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is printed**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of i also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin contains t-2 test cases as one test case has been processed by the code. The value of n is an integer between 2 and 100 as it is assigned the value of the first integer in the test case. The list ls contains n-3 integers as the last two integers have been popped from the list. The value of last is an integer between 1 and 10^9 as it is assigned the value of the last integer in the list. The value of other is an integer between 1 and 10^9 as it is assigned the value of the largest integer in the sorted list. The sum of last and other is printed as the output of the code.
