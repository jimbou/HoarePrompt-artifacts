The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500, t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n-2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n-2 (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), n is an integer between 2 and 100, ls is a list of n-2 integers, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is printed**
