The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ls` is a list of `n-4` integers, `last` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `other` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `last` and `other` is being printed, where the sum is between 2 and 2*10^9**
