Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500, t is greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100, ls is a list of n-4 integers, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `n = int(input().strip())`: This line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer between 2 and 100, its value is updated to the newly read integer. Stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.

2. `ls = input().split()`: This line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `ls`. Since `ls` was previously a list of `n-3` integers, its value is updated to the newly read list. Stdin is now empty.

3. `last = int(ls.pop())`: This line removes the last element from `ls` and assigns it to `last`. Since `last` was previously an integer between 1 and 10^9, its value is updated to the popped integer. `ls` now contains `n-4` integers.

4. `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())`: This line sorts `ls` in ascending order, removes the last element, and assigns it to `other`. Since `other` was previously an integer between 1 and 10^9, its value is updated to the popped integer. `ls` remains unchanged.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the values of `n`, `ls`, `last`, and `other` updated according to the operations performed by the code.
