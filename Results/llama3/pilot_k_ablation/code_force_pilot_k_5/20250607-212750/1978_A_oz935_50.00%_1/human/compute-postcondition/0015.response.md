Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the sum of the variables `last` and `other`.

The value of `last` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `other` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9. The sum of `last` and `other` is between 2 and 2*10^9.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of these two integers, which is a value between 2 and 2*10^9.

Output: **a value between 2 and 2*10^9 (which is the sum of last and other)**
