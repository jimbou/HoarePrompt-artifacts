To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `t` is an integer between 3 and 500.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `t` is not changed by the loop, its value remains the same.

State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500, i is 4, stdin contains t-5 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100, ls is a list of n-5 integers, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is between 2 and 2*10^9**
