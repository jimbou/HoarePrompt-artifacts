Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1.**

The code reads the entire standard input into the `data` variable, which becomes a list of strings, each representing a line from the input. The first line of the input is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. The `test_cases` list is initialized as an empty list. The `idx` variable is set to 1, indicating that it will be used to index into the `data` list, starting from the second line (since indexing starts at 0). The `input` variable is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, which is a function that reads the entire standard input as a string.
