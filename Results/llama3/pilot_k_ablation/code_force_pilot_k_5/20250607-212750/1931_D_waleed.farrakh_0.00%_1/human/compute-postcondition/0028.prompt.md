Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results`, and the first element of the `results` list which is `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`, and the second element of the `results` list which is `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`, and the third element in the `results` list which is `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in `results`, and the fourth element of the results list which is `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 5 elements, `result` is the fifth element in `results`, and the fifth element of the `results` list which is `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
