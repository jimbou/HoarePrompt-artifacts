Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 3 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 3, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 3, num is the third positive integer in arr, and count is 1 plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively.**

Here is a natural language description of the output state:

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with the exception of the `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `count` variables. The `mod_x` dictionary now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is 3, indicating that the remainder of `num` divided by `x` has been encountered three times. Similarly, the `mod_y` dictionary now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is 3, indicating that the remainder of `num` divided by `y` has been encountered three times. The `count` variable has been incremented by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y` respectively, which is 9 (3*3).
