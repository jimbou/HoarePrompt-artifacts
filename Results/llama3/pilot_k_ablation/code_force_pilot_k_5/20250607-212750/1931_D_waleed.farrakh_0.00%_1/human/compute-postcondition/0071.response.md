Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the `results` list contains the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `test_cases` list has been exhausted, and the loop variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are no longer defined. The dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` are also no longer defined, as they were local to the loop body. The variable `count` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body. The variable `num` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body. The variable `rem_x` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body. The variable `rem_y` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the `results` list contains the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for each tuple in `test_cases`. The loop variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are no longer defined, and the dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` are also no longer defined. The variable `count` is no longer defined, and the variable `num` is no longer defined. The variables `rem_x` and `rem_y` are no longer defined.
