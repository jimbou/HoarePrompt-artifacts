Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable test_cases will contain a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. The values of n, x, y, and arr are positive integers. The variable t is a positive integer, and the variable data is a list of strings. The variable idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, where t is the number of iterations of the loop.
