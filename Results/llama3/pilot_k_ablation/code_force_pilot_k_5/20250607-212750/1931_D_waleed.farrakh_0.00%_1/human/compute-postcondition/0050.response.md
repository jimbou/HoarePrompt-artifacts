Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 3 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 3, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 3, num is the third positive integer in arr, and count is the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively.**

In this output state, the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` have been updated to reflect the new remainders when `num` is divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The value of `count` has also been updated to include the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the new remainders. All other variables remain unchanged.
