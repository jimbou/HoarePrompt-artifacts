To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `result` and `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the third element in `results`, and it is being printed. This means that the loop has already executed three times.

For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least four elements, and `result` must be the fourth element in `results`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `test_cases` remains the same (a list of tuples)
* `t` remains the same (a positive integer)
* `data` remains the same (a list of strings)
* `idx` remains the same (an integer equal to 2t + 1)
* `results` must have at least 4 elements
* `result` is the fourth element in `results`

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in `results`**
