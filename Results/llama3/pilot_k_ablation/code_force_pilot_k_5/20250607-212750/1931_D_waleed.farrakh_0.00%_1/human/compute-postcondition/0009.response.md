The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 5.
