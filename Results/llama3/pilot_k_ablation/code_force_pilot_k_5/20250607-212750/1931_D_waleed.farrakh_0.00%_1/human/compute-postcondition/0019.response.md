The only variable in the loop head is variable `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If the `results` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in the `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `results` must have at least 3 elements and the `result` is the third element in the `results`.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
