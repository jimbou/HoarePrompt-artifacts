Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 4 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 4, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 4, num is the fourth positive integer in arr, and count is 1 plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively.**

The code block calculates the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y`, increments the count by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for these remainders, and updates the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for these remainders. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged.
