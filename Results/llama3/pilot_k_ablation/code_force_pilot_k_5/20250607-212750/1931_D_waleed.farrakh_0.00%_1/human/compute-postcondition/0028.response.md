Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with a certain number of elements, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial state of the variables `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, and `idx` remains unchanged. However, the `results` list has been fully traversed, and all its elements have been printed. The number of elements in `results` is not specified, as it depends on the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.
