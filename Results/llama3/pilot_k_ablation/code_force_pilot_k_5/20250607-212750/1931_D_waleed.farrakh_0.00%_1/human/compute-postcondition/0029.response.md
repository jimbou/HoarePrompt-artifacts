Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. The results are then printed to the console. The function does not modify the input test cases or any other external state.**
