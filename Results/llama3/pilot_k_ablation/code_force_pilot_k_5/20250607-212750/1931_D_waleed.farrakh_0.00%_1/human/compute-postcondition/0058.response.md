Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, x is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, y is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, arr is a list containing at least n positive integers from the second tuple in test_cases, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is an empty dictionary, mod_y is an empty dictionary, num is the last positive integer in arr, and count is 0.**

The code initializes `count` to 0 and resets `mod_x` and `mod_y` to empty dictionaries. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
