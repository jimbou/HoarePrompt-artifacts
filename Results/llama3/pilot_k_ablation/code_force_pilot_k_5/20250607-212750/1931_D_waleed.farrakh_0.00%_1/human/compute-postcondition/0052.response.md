Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 4 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 4, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 4, num is the fourth positive integer in arr, and count is the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively**

The code modifies the values of `rem_x`, `rem_y`, `count`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`. The first line calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `rem_x`. The second line calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `rem_y`. The third line increments `count` by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The fourth line updates the value of `mod_x` for the remainder of `num` divided by `x` to be the current value plus 1. The fifth line updates the value of `mod_y` for the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to be the current value plus 1.
