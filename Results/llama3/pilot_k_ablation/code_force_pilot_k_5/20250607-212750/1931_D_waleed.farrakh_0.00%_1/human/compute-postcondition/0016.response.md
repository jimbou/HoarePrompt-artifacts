To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `result` and `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the first element in `results`, and it is being printed. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next element in `results`.

So, we adjust the state of `result` to be the second element in `results`, and the state of `results` remains the same, but with the first element already processed.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
