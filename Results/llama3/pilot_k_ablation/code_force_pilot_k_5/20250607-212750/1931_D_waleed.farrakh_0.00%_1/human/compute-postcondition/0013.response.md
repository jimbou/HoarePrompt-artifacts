According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, so we can adjust `results` to have at least 1 element. The variable `result` is also in the loop head, so we can adjust it to be the first element in `results`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
