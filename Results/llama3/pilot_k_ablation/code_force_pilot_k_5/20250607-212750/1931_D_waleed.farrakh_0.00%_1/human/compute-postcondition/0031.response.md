To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Since `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, we need to adjust its state to be the first element in `arr` for the loop to start. We also need to adjust the state of `count` to be 1, as it will be incremented in the loop body.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least one positive integer, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is 1**
