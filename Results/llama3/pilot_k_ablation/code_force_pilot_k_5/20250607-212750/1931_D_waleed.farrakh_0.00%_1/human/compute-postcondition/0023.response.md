Based on the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the fourth element in the `results` list.

Since the exact value of the fourth element in the `results` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of the fourth element in the `results` list.

Output: **the fourth element in the results list**
