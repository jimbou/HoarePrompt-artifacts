Output State: **The program returns the list `results` containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for each tuple in `test_cases`.**

In this output state, the list `results` contains the calculated sums of products for each tuple in `test_cases`. The values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are no longer defined, but their products have been accumulated in the `results` list. The loop variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are no longer defined, as they were local to the loop body. The dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` are also no longer defined, as they were local to the loop body. The variables `count`, `num`, `rem_x`, and `rem_y` are no longer defined, as they were local to the loop body.
