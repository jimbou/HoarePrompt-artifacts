To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for num in arr:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the list `arr`. The current state is:

* `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples
* `n` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`
* `x` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`
* `y` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`
* `arr` is a list containing at least 3 positive integers from the second tuple in `test_cases`
* `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively
* `mod_x` is a dictionary with a key of `num % x` and a value of 1
* `mod_y` is a dictionary with a key of `num % y` and a value of 1
* `num` is the fourth positive integer in `arr`
* `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively
* `rem_x` is `-num % x`
* `rem_y` is `num % y`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the list `arr`. Since `num` is currently the fourth positive integer in `arr`, the next element would be the fifth positive integer in `arr`.

Therefore, the adjusted state would be:

* `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples (no change)
* `n` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases` (no change)
* `x` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases` (no change)
* `y` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases` (no change)
* `arr` is a list containing at least 3 positive integers from the second tuple in `test_cases` (no change)
* `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively (no change)
* `mod_x` is a dictionary with a key of `num % x` and a value of 1 (no change)
* `mod_y` is a dictionary with a key of `num % y` and a value of 1 (no change)
* `num` is the fifth positive integer in `arr`
* `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively (no change)
* `rem_x` is `-num % x` (updated with the new value of `num`)
* `rem_y` is `num % y` (updated with the new value of `num`)
