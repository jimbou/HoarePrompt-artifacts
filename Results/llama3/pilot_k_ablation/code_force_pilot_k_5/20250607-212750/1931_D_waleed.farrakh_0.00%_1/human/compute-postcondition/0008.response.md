Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is at least 4, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 9**

The code block first extracts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the string at index `idx` in the `data` list and assigns them to the corresponding variables. Then, it extracts a list of integers `arr` from the string at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list. These extracted values are then appended to the `test_cases` list as a tuple. Finally, the value of `idx` is incremented by 2.
