Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` positive integers from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and now it also contains the last calculated `count` value, `mod_x` is a dictionary with keys of `num % x` and values of the number of times each remainder occurs, `mod_y` is a dictionary with keys of `num % y` and values of the number of times each remainder occurs, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `rem_x` is `-num % x`, `rem_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x[num % x]` is `mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1`, `mod_y[num % y]` is `mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `results` list now contains the last calculated `count` value, which is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
