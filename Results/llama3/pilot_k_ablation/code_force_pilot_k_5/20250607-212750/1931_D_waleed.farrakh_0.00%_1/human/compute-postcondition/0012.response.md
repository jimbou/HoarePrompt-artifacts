Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `results`, which is assigned the return value of the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument. The value of `results` is not specified, as it depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
