Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x = {}
    mod_y = {}
    for num in arr:
        rem_x = -num % x
        rem_y = num % y
        count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)
        mod_x[num % x] = mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1
        mod_y[num % y] = mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is a dictionary with the remainders of all positive integers in `arr` when divided by `x` as keys and their respective counts as values, `mod_y` is a dictionary with the remainders of all positive integers in `arr` when divided by `y` as keys and their respective counts as values, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least one positive integer, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is a dictionary where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is 1 plus the number of times the remainder occurs, `mod_y` is a dictionary where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is 1 plus the number of times the remainder occurs, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is the updated count after adding the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively plus the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the new remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and the values are the number of times each remainder occurs, `mod_y` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the remainders of `num` divided by `y` and the values are the number of times each remainder occurs, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and `count` has been appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively and also the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for the last positive integer in `arr`, `mod_x` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and the values are the counts of each remainder, `mod_y` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the remainders of `num` divided by `y` and the values are the counts of each remainder, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is a positive integer from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` positive integers from the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and now it also contains the last calculated `count` value, `mod_x` is a dictionary with keys of `num % x` and values of the number of times each remainder occurs, `mod_y` is a dictionary with keys of `num % y` and values of the number of times each remainder occurs, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `rem_x` is `-num % x`, `rem_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x[num % x]` is `mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1`, `mod_y[num % y]` is `mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
