Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively and also the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for the last positive integer in `arr`, `mod_x` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and the values are the counts of each remainder, `mod_y` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the remainders of `num` divided by `y` and the values are the counts of each remainder, `num` is the last positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the `results` list updated to include the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for the last positive integer in `arr`.
