Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, x is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, y is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, arr is a list containing at least 3 positive integers from the second tuple in test_cases, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key of num % x and a value of 1, mod_y is a dictionary with a key of num % y and a value of 1, num is the fifth positive integer in arr, count is the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, rem_x is -num % x, rem_y is num % y, mod_x[num % x] is mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1, mod_y[num % y] is mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1**

The code block modifies the values of `rem_x`, `rem_y`, `count`, `mod_x[num % x]`, and `mod_y[num % y]`. The first line assigns the value of `-num % x` to `rem_x`. The second line assigns the value of `num % y` to `rem_y`. The third line increments `count` by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders `rem_x` and `rem_y` respectively. The fourth line increments the value of `mod_x[num % x]` by 1. The fifth line increments the value of `mod_y[num % y]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
