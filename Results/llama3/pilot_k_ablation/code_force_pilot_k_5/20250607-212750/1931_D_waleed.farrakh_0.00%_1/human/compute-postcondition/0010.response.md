Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is at least 5, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 11**

The code block has the following effects on the program:

1. The first line extracts three integers from the string at index `idx` in the `data` list and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. This means that `n`, `x`, and `y` now hold the values of the three integers extracted from the string.

2. The second line extracts a list of integers from the string at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list and assigns it to `arr`. This means that `arr` now holds the list of integers extracted from the string.

3. The third line appends a tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list. This means that `test_cases` now contains an additional tuple with the extracted values.

4. The fourth line increments the value of `idx` by 2. This means that `idx` now holds the value of 11.

The final state of the program is as follows:

* `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `arr` is a list of positive integers.
* `t` is at least 5 (no change).
* `data` is a list of strings (no change).
* `idx` is an integer equal to 11.

Note that the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not specified in the output state, as they depend on the specific input data. However, it is known that they are positive integers and a list of positive integers, respectively.
