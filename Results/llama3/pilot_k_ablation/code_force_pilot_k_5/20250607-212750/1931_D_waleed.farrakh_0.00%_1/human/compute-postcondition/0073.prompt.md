You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers.
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x = {}
        
        mod_y = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            rem_x = -num % x
            rem_y = num % y
            count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)
            mod_x[num % x] = mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1
            mod_y[num % y] = mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the `results` list contains the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `test_cases` list has been exhausted, and the loop variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are no longer defined. The dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` are also no longer defined, as they were local to the loop body. The variable `count` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body. The variable `num` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body. The variable `rem_x` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body. The variable `rem_y` is no longer defined, as it was local to the loop body.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for each tuple in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `results` containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively for each tuple in `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
