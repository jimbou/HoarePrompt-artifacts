To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arr` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 3 positive integers, and `num` is the third positive integer in `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `num` should be the next integer in `arr`, and `arr` should have at least 4 positive integers.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 positive integers, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is 3, `mod_y` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is 3, `num` is the fourth positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is 1 plus the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y` respectively plus the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y` respectively**
