The only variable in the loop head is variable  result, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results list.  If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 4 elements, result is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the result is the fifth element in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 2t + 1, `results` is a list with at least 5 elements, `result` is the fifth element in `results`**
