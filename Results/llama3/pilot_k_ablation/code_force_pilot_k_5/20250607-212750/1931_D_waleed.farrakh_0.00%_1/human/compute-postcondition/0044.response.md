Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least n positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is an empty dictionary, mod_y is an empty dictionary, num is the last positive integer in arr, and count is 0.**

The code initializes the variables `count`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` to 0, an empty dictionary, and an empty dictionary, respectively. This means that the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are reset, and `count` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
