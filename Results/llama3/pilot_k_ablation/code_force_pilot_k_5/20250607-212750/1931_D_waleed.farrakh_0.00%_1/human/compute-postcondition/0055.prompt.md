Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least n positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is an empty dictionary, mod_y is an empty dictionary, num is the last positive integer in arr, and count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    rem_x = -num % x
    rem_y = num % y
    count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)
    mod_x[num % x] = mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1
    mod_y[num % y] = mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 1 positive integer, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 1, mod_y is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 1, num is the first positive integer in arr, and count is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 2 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 2, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 2, num is the second positive integer in arr, and count is the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 3 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 3, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 3, num is the third positive integer in arr, and count is the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 4 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 4, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 4, num is the fourth positive integer in arr, and count is the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 5 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 5, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 5, num is the fifth positive integer in arr, and count is the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders when divided by x and y respectively.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
