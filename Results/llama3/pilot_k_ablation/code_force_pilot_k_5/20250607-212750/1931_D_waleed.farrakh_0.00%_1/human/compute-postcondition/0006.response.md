Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is at least 3, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 7**

The code executes in the following way: 

The first line assigns the values of the integers from the string at index idx in the data list to the variables n, x, and y. Since data is a list of strings, and idx is an integer equal to 5, the string at index 5 is split into three integers, which are assigned to n, x, and y. The second line assigns the values of the integers from the string at index idx + 1 in the data list to the variable arr. Since idx is an integer equal to 5, the string at index 6 is split into a list of integers, which is assigned to arr. The third line appends a tuple containing the values of n, x, y, and arr to the test_cases list. The fourth line increments the value of idx by 2, making idx equal to 7.
