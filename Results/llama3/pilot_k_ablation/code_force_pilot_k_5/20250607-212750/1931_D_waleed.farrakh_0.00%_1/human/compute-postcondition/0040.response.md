Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least 5 positive integers, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 5, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 5, num is the fifth positive integer in arr, and count is 1 plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively.**

The code executes as follows: The first line calculates the remainder of -num divided by x and assigns it to rem_x. The second line calculates the remainder of num divided by y and assigns it to rem_y. The third line increments count by the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively. The fourth line increments the value of mod_x for the remainder of num divided by x by 1. The fifth line increments the value of mod_y for the remainder of num divided by y by 1.
