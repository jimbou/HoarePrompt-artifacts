Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, x is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, y is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, arr is a list containing at least 2 positive integers from the second tuple in test_cases, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key of num % x and a value of 1, mod_y is a dictionary with a key of num % y and a value of 1, num is the third positive integer in arr, and count is the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively.**

The code block modifies the values of `rem_x`, `rem_y`, `count`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`. The first line calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `rem_x`. The second line calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `rem_y`. The third line increments `count` by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders `rem_x` and `rem_y`, respectively. The fourth line increments the value of `mod_x` for the key `num % x` by 1. The fifth line increments the value of `mod_y` for the key `num % y` by 1.
