To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `num` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the third positive integer in `arr`, and `arr` contains at least 3 positive integers. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 4 positive integers, and `num` should be the fourth positive integer in `arr`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 positive integers, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is 3, `mod_y` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is 3, `num` is the fourth positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively plus the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively**
