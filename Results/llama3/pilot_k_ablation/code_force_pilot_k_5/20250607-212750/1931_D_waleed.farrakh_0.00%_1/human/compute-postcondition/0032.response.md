Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list containing at least one positive integer, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by x and the value is 1, mod_y is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the remainder of num divided by y and the value is 1, num is the first positive integer in arr, and count is 1 plus the product of the values of mod_x and mod_y for the remainders of num divided by x and y respectively.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `results` list is also unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The `mod_x` and `mod_y` dictionaries are updated with a key-value pair each, where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and the value is 1. This is because the code increments the count of the remainder in the dictionaries by 1.

The `count` variable is incremented by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y` respectively. Since the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are 1, the product is also 1, and `count` becomes 2.
