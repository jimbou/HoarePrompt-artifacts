Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, x is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, y is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, arr is a list containing at least 3 positive integers from the second tuple in test_cases, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key of num % x and a value of 1, mod_y is a dictionary with a key of num % y and a value of 1, num is the fourth positive integer in arr, and count is the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, rem_x is -num % x, rem_y is num % y.**

In this output state, the values of `rem_x` and `rem_y` have been calculated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `count` has been updated by adding the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders `rem_x` and `rem_y`. The dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` have been updated with the new remainders and their corresponding values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
