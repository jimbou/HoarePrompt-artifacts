Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is at least 1, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 3**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the values of n, x, and y from the data list at index idx to the corresponding variables. The second line assigns the values of arr from the data list at index idx + 1 to the variable arr. The third line appends a tuple containing the values of n, x, y, and arr to the test_cases list. The fourth line increments the value of idx by 2.

After the code block executes, the values of n, x, y, and arr are updated based on the values in the data list. The test_cases list is also updated by appending a new tuple containing the updated values of n, x, y, and arr. The value of idx is incremented by 2, so it becomes 3.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of the variables that are modified by the code. The output state is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. The value of t is at least 1, and the data is a list of strings. The value of idx is an integer equal to 3.
