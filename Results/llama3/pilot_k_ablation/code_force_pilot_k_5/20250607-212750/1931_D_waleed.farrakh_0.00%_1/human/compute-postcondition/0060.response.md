Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, n is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, x is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, y is a positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, arr is a list containing at least 1 positive integer from the second tuple in test_cases, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary with a key of num % x and a value of 1, mod_y is a dictionary with a key of num % y and a value of 1, num is the first positive integer in arr, and count is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `results` list also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The `mod_x` and `mod_y` dictionaries are updated with a key-value pair each. The key for `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and the value is 1. Similarly, the key for `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, and the value is 1.

The `num` variable remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The `count` variable is incremented by the product of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for the remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively. However, since `mod_x` and `mod_y` are empty dictionaries initially, the product is 0, and therefore `count` remains 0.
