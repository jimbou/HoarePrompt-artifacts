To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, `t` must be at least 1, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 1**
