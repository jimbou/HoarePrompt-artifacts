To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 positive integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `arr` must have at least 1 positive integer and `num` is the first positive integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing at least 1 positive integer, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders when divided by `x` and `y` respectively, `mod_x` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first positive integer in `arr`, and `count` is 0**
