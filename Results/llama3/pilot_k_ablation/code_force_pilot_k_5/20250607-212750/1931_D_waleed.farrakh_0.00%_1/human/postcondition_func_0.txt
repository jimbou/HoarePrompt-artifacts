This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the remainders when divided by x and y, and counting the number of pairs that have matching remainders. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the sum of the products of the values of mod_x and mod_y for all remainders when divided by x and y respectively for each tuple in the input list.
