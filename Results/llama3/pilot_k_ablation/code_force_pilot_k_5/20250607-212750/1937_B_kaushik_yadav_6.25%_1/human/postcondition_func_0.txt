This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, and two binary strings a and b of length n. It then constructs a new string ans by concatenating characters from a and b based on certain conditions. The function prints the constructed string ans and a counter value, which represents the number of times a specific condition is met in the strings a and b. The function repeats this process for each test case.
