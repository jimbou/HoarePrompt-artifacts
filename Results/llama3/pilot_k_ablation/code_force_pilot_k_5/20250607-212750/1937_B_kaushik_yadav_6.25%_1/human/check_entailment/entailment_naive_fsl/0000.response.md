Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a simple concatenation of the first and second rows. For example, when the input is:

3
4
1101
1100

The program outputs:

11000
1

However, the correct output should be:

11000
2

Because there are two paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string: 11000.

The program's logic is flawed because it assumes that once it finds a '0' in the second row, it can simply append the rest of the second row to the answer. However, this is not always the case. The program needs to consider all possible paths and find the lexicographically smallest string among them.
