Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and an empty string is being printed. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is an integer and `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1, `j` is an integer, `a[j + 1]` is '0', and `b[j]` is '1'.***
