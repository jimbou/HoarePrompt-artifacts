The only object in the loop head is variable  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `a`. If `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be at least 3 and `a` must be a string with at least 4 characters.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 3, `counter` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4**
