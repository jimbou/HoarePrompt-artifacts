Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `work` is True. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is less than the length of `a`, or `b[i-1]` is not less than `a[i]`.***
