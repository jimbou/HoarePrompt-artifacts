Postcondition: ***_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 2 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, the string ans with the same length as a is being printed, and if the current value of a[j + 1] is equal to the current value of b[j], then counter is 2 and j is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
