Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a, an empty string is being printed, i is 3, and ans is being printed which is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a. If the character at index j+1 in string a is '0' and the character at index j in string b is '1', then counter is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
