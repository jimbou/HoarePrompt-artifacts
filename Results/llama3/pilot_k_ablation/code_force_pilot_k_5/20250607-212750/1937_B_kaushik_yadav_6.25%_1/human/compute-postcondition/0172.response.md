Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `len(a) - 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `work` is False, and `counter` is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, `n`, `ans`, `i`, and `work` as in the initial state. The string `a` will have at least `len(a) - 1` characters, and the string `b` will remain unchanged. The variable `j` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all characters in string `a` except the last one. The variable `counter` will be either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive, depending on the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true during the loop's execution.
