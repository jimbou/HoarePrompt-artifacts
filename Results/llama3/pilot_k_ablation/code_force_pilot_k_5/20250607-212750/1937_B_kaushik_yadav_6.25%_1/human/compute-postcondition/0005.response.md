The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first character of string `a` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, and `work` is True.**
