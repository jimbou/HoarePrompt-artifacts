Output State: **counter is 2 if a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', counter is 4 if a[j + 1] is equal to b[j], otherwise counter is 3, ans is a plus b, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is 3**

In this output state, the value of counter has been incremented by 1. If a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', counter is now 2. If a[j + 1] is equal to b[j], counter is now 4. In all other cases, counter is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
