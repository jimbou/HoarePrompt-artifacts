Postcondition: ***`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with len(a) characters, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is at least 4. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
