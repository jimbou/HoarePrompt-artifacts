Output: **counter is equal to the length of a if all characters in a are equal to the corresponding characters in b, otherwise counter is 1 if the last character in a is '0' and the last character in b is '1', otherwise counter is equal to the length of a minus the index of the last mismatch between a and b, ans is a plus b, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is equal to the length of a minus 1, and the value of counter is printed**
