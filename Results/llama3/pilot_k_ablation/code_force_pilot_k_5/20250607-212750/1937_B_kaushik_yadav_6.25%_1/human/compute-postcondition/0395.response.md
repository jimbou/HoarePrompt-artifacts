The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than the length of a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1 and i is less than the length of a minus 1 or i is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 and i is less than the length of a minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of a needed to have been greater than its current value.
State: **`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than its current value, `b` is a string.**
