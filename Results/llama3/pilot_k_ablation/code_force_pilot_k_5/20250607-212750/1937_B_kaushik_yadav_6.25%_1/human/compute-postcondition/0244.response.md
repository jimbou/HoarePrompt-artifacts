Postcondition: **The state of the variables `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged, except for `counter` which is 1 if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', otherwise the state of `counter` remains unchanged, but if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 2.**
