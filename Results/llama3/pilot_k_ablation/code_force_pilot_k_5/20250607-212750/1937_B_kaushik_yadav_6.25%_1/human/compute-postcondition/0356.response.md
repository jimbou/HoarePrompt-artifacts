Postcondition: ***_ is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the empty string, `i` is 0, the string that is the first character of `a` plus the empty string is being printed, `counter` is not defined, `j` is not defined, and the current value of `work` is True. Additionally, the current value of `i` plus 1 is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in string `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus 1 in string `a`.***
