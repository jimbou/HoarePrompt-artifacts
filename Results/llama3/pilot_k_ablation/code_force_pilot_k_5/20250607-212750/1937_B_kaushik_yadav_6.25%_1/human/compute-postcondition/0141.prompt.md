Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 1, n is an integer from stdin, a is a non-empty string from stdin, b is a string from stdin, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, j is undefined, counter is undefined, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string with length greater than 0, b is a string, ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a plus the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a, i is 1 if i + 1 is not less than the length of a or the character at index i in b is not less than the character at index i + 1 in a. Otherwise, i is 0, work is False if i + 1 is less than the length of a and the character at index i in b is less than the character at index i + 1 in a. Otherwise, work is True, j is undefined, counter is undefined, stdin is empty. If work is False, then ans is a string consisting of the first character of b, i is 1, work is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string with length greater than 0, b is a string. If work is True, then ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a plus the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a plus the character at index i of a, and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string consisting of the first character of b, i is 1, and work is False. j is undefined, counter is undefined, and stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 1, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or not. `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 2, `b` is a string, `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or not, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and stdin is empty. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length of 3, `b` is a string, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is True, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is False and `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a` if `work` is False, and stdin is empty. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a`. Otherwise, `work` is True and `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
