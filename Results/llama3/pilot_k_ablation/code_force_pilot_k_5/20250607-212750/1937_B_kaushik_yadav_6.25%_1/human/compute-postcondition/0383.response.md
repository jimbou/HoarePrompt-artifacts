Postcondition: ***`_` is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a has a length greater than 2, b is a string. If i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then ans is increased by a[i] and work is False. Otherwise, if i + 1 equals the length of a, ans is increased by b[i]. Otherwise, ans is increased by a[i] and i is increased by 1.***
