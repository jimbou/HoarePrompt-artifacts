Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 1, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, plus the character at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is 1. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 10^4, and `_` is still 1. The value of `n` is still an integer, and `a` still has a length greater than 1. The value of `b` is still a string. 

If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, plus the character at index `i` of `a`. 

If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. 

The values of `j` and `counter` are still undefined, and stdin is still empty.
