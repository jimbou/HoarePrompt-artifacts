Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, stdin is empty. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `work` has been explicitly set to False. All other variables remain unchanged.
