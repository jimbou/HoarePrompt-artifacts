Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 4. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, otherwise `counter` is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.***
