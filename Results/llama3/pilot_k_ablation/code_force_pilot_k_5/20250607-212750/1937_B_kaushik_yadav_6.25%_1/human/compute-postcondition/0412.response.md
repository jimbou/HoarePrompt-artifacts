Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, and the variables have been updated accordingly. If the character at index j+1 of string a is equal to the character at index j of string b, then counter is incremented to 2, and the string ans, which is equal to a plus b, is being printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. The values of _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of a[j+1] is '0' and the current value of b[j] is '1'.**
