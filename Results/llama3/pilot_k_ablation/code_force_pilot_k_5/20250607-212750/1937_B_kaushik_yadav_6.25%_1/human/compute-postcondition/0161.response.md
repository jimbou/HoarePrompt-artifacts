Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is either 2, 3 or 4 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, or `counter` is either 1 or 2 if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', or `counter` is either 2 or 3 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`.***
