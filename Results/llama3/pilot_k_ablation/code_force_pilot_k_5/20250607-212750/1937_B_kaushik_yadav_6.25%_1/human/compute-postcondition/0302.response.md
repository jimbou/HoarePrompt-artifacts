Output State: **_*_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 4 characters, b is a string. If work is True and i + 1 < len(a), then either ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 2, or ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 3. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then work is False, ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), and i is 2. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 3 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is False and i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 3 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 4 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 3, and work is False. And i must be less than 4.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of _*_ remains 3, t is still an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is still an integer, a is still a string with at least 4 characters, and b is still a string. The value of i has been incremented by 1. The conditions for work, ans, and i have been updated accordingly. If work is True and i + 1 is less than the length of a, then either ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 2, or ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 3. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then work is False, ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), and i is 2. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 3 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is False and i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 3 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 4 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 3, and work is False. And i must be less than 4.
