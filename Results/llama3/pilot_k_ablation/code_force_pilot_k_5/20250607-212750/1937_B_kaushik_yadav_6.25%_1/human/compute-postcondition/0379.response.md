Output State: **`_`* is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a must have a length greater than 2, b is a string, ans is increased by a[i], work is False**

In this output state, the values of `_`*, t, n, a, b, and ans remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is that the variable work is now assigned the value False.
