Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 4, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, the string `ans` is being printed, `j` is 3. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 3. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 1.***
