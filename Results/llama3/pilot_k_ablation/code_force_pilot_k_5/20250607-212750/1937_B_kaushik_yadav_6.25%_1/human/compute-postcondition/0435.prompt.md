Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is an empty string, b is a string, ans is a string equal to a plus b, i is equal to the length of a, work is False, the string ans which is equal to a plus b is being printed, counter is 1, j is not defined
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The program has executed the if-else block, and the variables have been updated accordingly. If the character at index j+1 of string a is '0' and the character at index j of string b is '1', then counter is 1, and the string ans, which is equal to a plus b, is being printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables, and counter is 1. The values of _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *counter is 1 if a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', otherwise counter is 2 if a[j + 1] is equal to b[j], otherwise counter remains 1, ans is a plus b, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *counter is 1 if a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', otherwise counter is 3 if a[j + 1] is equal to b[j], otherwise counter is 2, ans is a plus b, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *counter, ans, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is 3. If a[j + 1] is equal to b[j], counter is 4. If a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', counter is 1. Otherwise, counter is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *counter, ans, _, t, n, a has at least 5 elements, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is 4. If a[j + 1] is equal to '0' and b[j] is equal to '1', then counter is 1. Otherwise, counter remains unchanged




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
