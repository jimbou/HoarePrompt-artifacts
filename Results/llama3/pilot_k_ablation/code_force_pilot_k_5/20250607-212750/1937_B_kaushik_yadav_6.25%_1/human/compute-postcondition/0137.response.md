Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length of 3, `b` is a string, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True and `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is True, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is False and `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a` if `work` is False, and stdin is empty.**
