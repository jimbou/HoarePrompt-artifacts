Output State: **_*_ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a must have a length greater than 1 plus 1, b is a string, ans is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index i of b, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1**

In this output state, the value of _*_ remains unchanged at 4. The value of t also remains unchanged, still being an integer between 5 and 10^4. The value of n remains an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The length of a is still greater than 1 plus 1. The value of b is still a string. The value of ans is now equal to its original value plus the character at index i of b. The value of i is now equal to its original value plus 1.
