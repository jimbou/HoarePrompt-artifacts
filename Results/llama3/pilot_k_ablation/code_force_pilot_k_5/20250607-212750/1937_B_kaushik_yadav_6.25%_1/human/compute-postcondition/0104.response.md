Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string with length greater than 0, b is a string, ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a plus the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a, i is 1 if i + 1 is not less than the length of a or the character at index i in b is not less than the character at index i + 1 in a. Otherwise, i is 0, work is False if i + 1 is less than the length of a and the character at index i in b is less than the character at index i + 1 in a. Otherwise, work is True, j is undefined, counter is undefined, stdin is empty. If work is False, then ans is a string consisting of the first character of b, i is 1, work is False.***
