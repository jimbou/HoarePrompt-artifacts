Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 2, `b` is a string, `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or not, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and stdin is empty. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a`.***
