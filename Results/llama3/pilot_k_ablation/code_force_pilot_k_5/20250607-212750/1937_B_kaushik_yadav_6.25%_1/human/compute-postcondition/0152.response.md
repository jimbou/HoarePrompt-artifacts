To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for j in range(len(a) - 1):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`. Since `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `len(a) - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, `j` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 1**
