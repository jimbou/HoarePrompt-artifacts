Postcondition: ***`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 2, `b` is a string. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a` plus the character at index `i` in string `b`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by the character at index `i-1` in string `a`.***
