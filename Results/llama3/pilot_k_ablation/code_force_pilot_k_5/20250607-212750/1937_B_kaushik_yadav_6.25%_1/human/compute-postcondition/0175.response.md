The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `len(a) - 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `work` is False, and `counter` is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive**
