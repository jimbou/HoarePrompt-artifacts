Postcondition: ***`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i` are unchanged, `j` is `k + 1`, and `counter` is either 1 or increased by 1, depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or increased by 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
