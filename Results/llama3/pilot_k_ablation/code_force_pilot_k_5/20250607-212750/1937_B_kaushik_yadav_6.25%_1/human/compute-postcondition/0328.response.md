To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for j in range(len(a) - 1):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 2 (since `i` is at least 2 and `j` is not explicitly mentioned to be different from `i`). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

The state of `a` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with len(a) characters, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is at least 3**
