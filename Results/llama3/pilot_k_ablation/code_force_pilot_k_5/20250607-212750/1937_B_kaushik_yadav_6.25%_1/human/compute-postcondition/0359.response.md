Postcondition: ***`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the empty string, `i` is 0, the string that is the first character of `a` plus the empty string is being printed, `counter` is not defined, `j` is not defined, the current value of `work` is True, and either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The current value of `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`.***
