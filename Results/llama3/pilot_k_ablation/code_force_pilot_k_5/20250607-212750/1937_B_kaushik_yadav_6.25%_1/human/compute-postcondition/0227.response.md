Postcondition: ***_* is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, then ans also includes the character at index i in string b. Otherwise, ans includes the character at index i+1 in string a. If i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1], then work is False, and if counter is 1 then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 1 in string a, else ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index 2 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a. If work is True and i is 2 or 3, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, the character at index i in string b, and the character at index i+1 in string b. If work is False and i is 2 or 3, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, the character at index i in string b, and the character at index i+1 in string b. i is either 1, 2 or 3.***
