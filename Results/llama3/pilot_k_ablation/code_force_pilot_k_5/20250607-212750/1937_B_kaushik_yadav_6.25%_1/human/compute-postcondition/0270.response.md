Postcondition: ***_ is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with exactly 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with 1 character (the first character of `a`), `i` is 0, `work` is True, and stdin contains no input. Either (i + 1 is not less than len(a)) or (b[i] is not less than a[i + 1])**
