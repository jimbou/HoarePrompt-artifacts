Postcondition: ***`_` is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a has a length greater than 2, b is a string. If work is True, then if i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], ans is increased by a[i] and work is False. Otherwise, if i + 1 equals the length of a, ans is increased by b[i]. Otherwise, ans is increased by a[i] and i is increased by 1. If work is False, ans is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index i of b, and i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1.***
