Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least len(a) - 1 characters, b is a string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, an empty string is being printed, j is an integer and is equal to len(a) - 1, work is True, and counter is either 1 or a value between 2 and len(a) - 1 inclusive, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or a value between 2 and len(a) - 1 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 1 character, b is a string, ans is a string, i is either 1 or 2, an empty string is being printed, j is an integer and is equal to len(a) - 1, work is either True or False, and counter is either 1 or a value between 2 and len(a) - 1 inclusive, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or a value between 2 and len(a) - 1 inclusive. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, and if i + 1 is less than the length of a and the character at index i in string b is less than the character at index i + 1 in string a, then work is False. Otherwise, either i + 1 is not less than len(a) or b[i] is not less than a[i + 1], and if i + 1 is equal to len(a), then ans also includes the character at index i of b. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, and counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a and the character at index 1 in string a, and if the character at index 1 in string b is less than the character at index 2 in string a, then work is False. Otherwise, b[1] is not less than a[2], and if work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b and the character at index 1 in string a. If i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then work is False, ans is equal to the first character of b and the character at index 1 in string a, and i is 1. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string b, and i is 1. Otherwise, i is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *_* is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string a. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string a. If i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then work is False, ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string a, and i is 1. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b, and i is 1. Otherwise, if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, then i is either 2 or 3, and i is less than 4. If the character at index 1 in string b is less than the character at index 2 in string a, then work is False. Otherwise, b[1] is not less than a[2], and if work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string a. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string b. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string b. i is either 2 or 3.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b. i is either 1 or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *_* is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, and the character at index i in string b. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, then ans also includes the character at index i in string b. Otherwise, ans includes the character at index i+1 in string a. If i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1], then work is False, and if counter is 1 then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 1 in string a, else ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index 2 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a. If work is True and i is 2 or 3, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, the character at index i in string b, and the character at index i+1 in string b. If work is False and i is 2 or 3, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, the character at index i in string a, the character at index i in string b, and the character at index i+1 in string b. i is either 1, 2 or 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
