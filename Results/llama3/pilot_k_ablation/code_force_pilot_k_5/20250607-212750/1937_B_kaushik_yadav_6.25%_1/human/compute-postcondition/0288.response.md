Postcondition: ***_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string. If work is True, then either ans is a string with 2 characters (the first character of a and the character at index i of a) and i is less than len(a), or ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a) and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b and the character at index 1 of a, and i is 1 if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 2 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a), i is 1, and work is False. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b and the character at index 1 of a, and i is 2.***
