The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Since `a` has exactly 3 characters and `i` is 0, the character at index 0 of `a` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with exactly 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with 1 character (the first character of `a`), `i` is 0, `work` is True, and stdin contains no input.**
