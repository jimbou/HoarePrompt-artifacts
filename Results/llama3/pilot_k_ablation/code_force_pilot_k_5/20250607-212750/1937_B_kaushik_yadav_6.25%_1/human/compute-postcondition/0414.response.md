Postcondition: ***The program has executed the if-else block, and the variables have been updated accordingly. If the character at index j+1 of string a is '0' and the character at index j of string b is '1', then counter is 1, and the string ans, which is equal to a plus b, is being printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables, and counter is 1. The values of _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged.***
