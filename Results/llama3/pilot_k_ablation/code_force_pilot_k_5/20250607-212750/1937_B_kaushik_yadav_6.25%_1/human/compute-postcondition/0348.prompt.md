Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 5 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is False, and the string `ans` with the same length as `a` is being printed, `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 2 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, the string ans with the same length as a is being printed. If a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', then j is 0, a[j + 1] is '0', b[j] is '1', and counter is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with len(a) characters, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is at least 3. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with len(a) characters, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is at least 4. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 6 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, j is at least 5. If a[j + 1] is equal to '0' and b[j] is equal to '1', then counter is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *_*_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 7 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, j is at least 6. If the character at index j+1 in string a is '0' and the character at index j in string b is '1', then the counter is set to 1. Otherwise, the counter is increased by 1 if the character at index j+1 in string a is equal to the character at index j in string b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
