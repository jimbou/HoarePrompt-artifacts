Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
