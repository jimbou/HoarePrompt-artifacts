Postcondition: ***_* is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If work is True, then ans includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string a. If work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string a. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, then ans also includes the character at index i in string b. Otherwise, ans includes the character at index i+1 in string a. i is either 1 or 2***
