Postcondition: ***`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with exactly 3 characters, `b` is a string, `work` is True, and stdin contains no input. If `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, then `ans` is a string with 2 characters (the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`) and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is a string with 1 character (the first character of `a`), `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
