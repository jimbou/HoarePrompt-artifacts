Postcondition: ***_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 2 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, the string ans with the same length as a is being printed. If a[j + 1] is '0' and b[j] is '1', then j is 0, a[j + 1] is '0', b[j] is '1', and counter is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
