The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _ and t. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 4 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 4.
State: **_ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 5 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is len(a), work is False, the string ans with the same length as a is being printed, counter is the number of times a[j + 1] is equal to b[j] in the string a, j is len(a) - 1, and the counter is printed which is equal to the number of times a[j + 1] is equal to b[j] in the string a**
