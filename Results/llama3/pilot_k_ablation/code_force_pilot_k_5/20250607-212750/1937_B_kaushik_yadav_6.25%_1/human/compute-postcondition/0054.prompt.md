Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 lines each.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `work` is True if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`. Otherwise, either `i` is 1 and `i` is less than the length of `a`, or `b[i-1]` is not less than `a[i]`, or `i` is 1 and `ans` is equal to the first character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 1, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `work` is True if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False. If `work` is True, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b`. If `work` is False, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `work` is True if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False. If `work` is True, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than or equal to 3, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `work` is True if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False. If `work` is True, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than or equal to 4, `b` is a string, `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `work` is True, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` includes the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a`, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
