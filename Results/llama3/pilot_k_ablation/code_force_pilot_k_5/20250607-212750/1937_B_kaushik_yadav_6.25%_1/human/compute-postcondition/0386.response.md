The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than the length of a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be less than the length of a minus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`_` is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a has a length greater than 2, b is a string, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1 and i is less than the length of a minus 1**
