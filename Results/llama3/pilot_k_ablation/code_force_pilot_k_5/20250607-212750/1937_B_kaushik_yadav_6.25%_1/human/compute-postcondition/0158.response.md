Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', then `counter` is either 2 or 3, or if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 3 or 4.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is now 2. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', then `counter` is either 2 or 3. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
