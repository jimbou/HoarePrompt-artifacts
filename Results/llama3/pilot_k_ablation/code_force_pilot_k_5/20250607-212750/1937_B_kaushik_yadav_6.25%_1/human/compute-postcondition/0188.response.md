Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 1 character, b is a string, ans is a string with the first character of a, i is either 1 or 2, an empty string is being printed, j is an integer and is equal to len(a) - 1, work is either True or False, and counter is either 1 or a value between 2 and len(a) - 1 inclusive, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or a value between 2 and len(a) - 1 inclusive. If i + 1 is less than the length of a and the character at index i in string b is less than the character at index i + 1 in string a, then work is False. Otherwise, either i + 1 is not less than len(a) or b[i] is not less than a[i + 1], and if i + 1 is equal to len(a), then ans also includes the character at index i of b.**
