Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 lines each.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, the string `ans` is being printed, `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and `counter` is equal to the number of times `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` plus 1, or 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', and counter is printed, counter (where counter is the number of times `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` plus 1, or 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1')

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `len(a) - 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `work` is False, and `counter` is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a, an empty string is being printed, i is 3, and ans is being printed which is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a, j is len(a) - 1, and counter is either 1 or increased by 1, depending on the values of a[j + 1] and b[j], and the counter is being printed which is either 1 or increased by 1, depending on the values of a[j + 1] and b[j]

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: _ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 5 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is len(a), work is False, the string ans with the same length as a is being printed, counter is the number of times a[j + 1] is equal to b[j] in the string a, j is len(a) - 1, and the counter is printed which is equal to the number of times a[j + 1] is equal to b[j] in the string a

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: counter is equal to the length of a if all characters in a are equal to the corresponding characters in b, otherwise counter is 1 if the last character in a is '0' and the last character in b is '1', otherwise counter is equal to the length of a minus the index of the last mismatch between a and b, ans is a plus b, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is equal to the length of a minus 1, and the value of counter is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
