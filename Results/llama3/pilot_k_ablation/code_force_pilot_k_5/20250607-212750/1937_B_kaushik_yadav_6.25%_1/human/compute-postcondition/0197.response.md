Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, work is either True or False, and counter is either 1 or 2, and the value of counter is being printed which is either 1 or 2. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index i in string b, and i is 1. Otherwise, i is 2, and if work is True, then ans includes the first character of a and the character at index 1 in string a, and if the character at index 1 in string b is less than the character at index 2 in string a, then work is False. Otherwise, b[1] is not less than a[2], and if work is False, then ans is equal to the first character of b and the character at index 1 in string a.***
