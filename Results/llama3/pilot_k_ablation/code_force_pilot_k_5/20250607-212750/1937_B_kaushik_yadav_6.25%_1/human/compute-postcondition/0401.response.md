Postcondition: **`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than its current value, `b` is a string. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `a[i]` and `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the value of `a[i-1]` and `i` is increased by 1.**
