The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `a`. If `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 4 characters.
State: **`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with len(a) characters, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is at least 4, `counter` is an integer**
