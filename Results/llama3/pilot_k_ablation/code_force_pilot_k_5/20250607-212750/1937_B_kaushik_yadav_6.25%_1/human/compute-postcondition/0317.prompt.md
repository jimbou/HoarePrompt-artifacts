Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with exactly 3 characters, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then either `ans` is a string with 1 character (the first character of `a`) and either `i` is 1 or `i` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, or `ans` is a string with 2 characters (the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`) and `i` is 0. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string. If work is True, then either ans is a string with 2 characters (the first character of a and the character at index i of a) and i is less than len(a), or ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a) and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b and the character at index 1 of a, and i is 1 if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 2 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a), i is 1, and work is False. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b and the character at index 1 of a, and i is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *_* is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string. If work is True and i + 1 < len(a), then either ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 1, or ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 2. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then work is False, ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a), and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 1 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 2 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is False and i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 3 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a), i is 2, and work is False.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 4 characters, b is a string. If work is True, then if i + 1 < len(a), ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 2, or ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 3. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 2, and work is False. If work is False, then if i + 1 < len(a), ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 3 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a), i is 2, and work is False. If i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 3 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 4 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 3, and work is False. And i must be less than 4.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 5 characters, b is a string. If work is True, then if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1], ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2 if i + 1 < 2, or ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), and i is 3 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), and i is less than 3. If work is False, then if i + 1 < len(a), ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 3 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 4 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 3, and work is False. If i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 4 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 5 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 4, and work is False. And i must be less than 5.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
