Output State: **_*_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 7 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, j is at least 6, counter is 1. If the character at index j+1 in string a is equal to the character at index j in string b, then the counter is not increased because counter is assigned to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables keep their initial values except for counter which is assigned to 1. The condition that if the character at index j+1 in string a is equal to the character at index j in string b, then the counter is increased by 1 is not applied because counter is assigned to 1.
