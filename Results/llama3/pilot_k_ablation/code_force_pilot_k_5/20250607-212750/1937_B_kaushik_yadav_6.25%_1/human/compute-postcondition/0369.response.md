Output State: **_* is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string, ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if work is True and i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i] if work is True, otherwise ans is a string containing the first character of b plus a[i], i is 0 if work is True and i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise i is 1 plus 1, work is False, the string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, j is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of _* remains 4, t remains an integer between 5 and 10^4, n remains an integer, a remains a non-empty string, b remains a string. The value of ans changes to the first character of a plus b[i] if work is True and i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i] if work is True, otherwise ans is a string containing the first character of b plus a[i]. The value of i changes to 0 if work is True and i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise i is 1 plus 1. The value of work remains False. The string ans is still being printed. The variables counter and j remain undefined.
