Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a, an empty string is being printed, j is 2, counter is 1, and the value of counter is being printed which is 1, and i is 3, and ans is being printed which is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string, ans is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a, an empty string is being printed, i is 3, and ans is being printed which is a string that includes the first character of a, the character at index 1 in string a, and the character at index 2 in string a. If the character at index j+1 in string a is '0' and the character at index j in string b is '1', then counter is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The state of the variables `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged, except for `counter` which is 1 if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', otherwise the state of `counter` remains unchanged, but if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i` are unchanged, `j` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i` are unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, and `counter` is either 1 or increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i` are unchanged, `j` is `k + 1`, and `counter` is either 1 or increased by 1, depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or increased by 2. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
