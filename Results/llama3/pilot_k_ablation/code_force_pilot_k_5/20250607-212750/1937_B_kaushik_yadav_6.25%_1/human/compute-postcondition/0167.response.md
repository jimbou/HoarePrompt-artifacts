To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 4. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.**
