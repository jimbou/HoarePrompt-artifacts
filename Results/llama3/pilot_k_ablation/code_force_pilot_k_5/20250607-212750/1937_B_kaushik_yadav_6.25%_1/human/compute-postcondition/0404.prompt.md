Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, the empty string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, j is not defined
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string, ans is a string, i is 0 or 1, work is False, the string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, j is not defined. If work is True, then ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string, and i is 0 if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, and i is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *_* is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string. If work is True, then if i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i], and i is 1 plus 1. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, then ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] plus b[i], and i is 0. Otherwise, ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i], and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] plus b[i+1], and i is 2. In all cases, work is False, the string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, and j is not defined.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`_` is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a has a length greater than 2, b is a string. If work is True, then if i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], ans is increased by a[i] and work is False. Otherwise, if i + 1 equals the length of a, ans is increased by b[i]. Otherwise, ans is increased by a[i] and i is increased by 1. If work is False, ans is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index i of b, and i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 2, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is an integer equal to its original value plus 1 and `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a`, and `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a` plus the character at index `i` in string `b`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by the character at index `i-1` in string `a`. If `work` is False, then `i` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 and `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and `ans` is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index `i-1` of string `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than its current value, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `a[i]` and `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the value of `a[i-1]` and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the character at index `i` of string `b`, and `i` is an integer that is one more than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
