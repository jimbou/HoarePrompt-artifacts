Output State: **`_` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `counter` is 2 if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', otherwise `counter` is 3 if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, otherwise `counter` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables except `counter` and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is increased by 1. The value of `counter` depends on the characters at indices `j+1` and `j` in strings `a` and `b`, respectively. If the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', then `counter` is 2. If the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 3. Otherwise, `counter` is increased by 1.
