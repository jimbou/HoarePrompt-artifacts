Output State: **`_`* is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a must have a length greater than 2, b is a string, ans is increased by a[i].**

In this output state, the value of `_`* remains 4, t is still an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is still an integer, a must have a length greater than 2, and b is still a string. The only change is that the value of ans is increased by the value of a[i], where i is an index into the list a.
