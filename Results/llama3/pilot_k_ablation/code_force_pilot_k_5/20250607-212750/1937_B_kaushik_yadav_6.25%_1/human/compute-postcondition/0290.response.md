Output State: **_* is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string. If work is True, then either ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 2, or ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 1 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 2 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 1, and work is False. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of _* remains 3, and t remains an integer between 4 and 10^4. The value of n remains an integer, and a remains a string with exactly 3 characters. The value of b remains a string. 

If work is True, then the length of ans is either 3 or 4. If the length of ans is 3, then it contains the first character of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is less than 2. If the length of ans is 4, then it contains the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 1.

If work is False, then the length of ans is 3. It contains the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a. If i + 1 is less than 2 and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then i is 1. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then i is 2.

If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then the length of ans is 4. It contains the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a. In this case, i is 1 and work is False.

If work is False, then the length of ans is 3. It contains the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a. In this case, i is 2.
