Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from stdin, `a` is a non-empty string from stdin with length greater than 0, `b` is a string from stdin, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, stdin is empty, and the current value of work is True. Additionally, either `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`***
