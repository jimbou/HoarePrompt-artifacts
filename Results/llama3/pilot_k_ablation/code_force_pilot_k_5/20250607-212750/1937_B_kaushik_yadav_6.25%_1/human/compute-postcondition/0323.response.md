Output State: **_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 2 characters, b is a string, ans is a string with len(a) characters, i is at least 2, work is False, the string ans with the same length as a is being printed, counter is 2, j is 0, and the current value of a[j + 1] is equal to the current value of b[j].**

In this output state, the value of counter has been incremented by 1, resulting in counter being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
