Postcondition: ***`_` is 4, `t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 2, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is an integer equal to its original value plus 1 and `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a`, and `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a` plus the character at index `i` in string `b`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by the character at index `i-1` in string `a`. If `work` is False, then `i` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 and `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and `ans` is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index `i-1` of string `b`.***
