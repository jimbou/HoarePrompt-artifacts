Output State: **counter is equal to the length of a if all characters in a are equal to the corresponding characters in b, otherwise counter is 1 if the last character in a is '0' and the last character in b is '1', otherwise counter is equal to the length of a minus the index of the last mismatch between a and b, ans is a plus b, _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged, j is equal to the length of a minus 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* If all characters in string a are equal to the corresponding characters in string b, then the counter will be equal to the length of a.
* If the last character in a is '0' and the last character in b is '1', then the counter will be 1.
* Otherwise, the counter will be equal to the length of a minus the index of the last mismatch between a and b.
* The string ans, which is equal to a plus b, remains unchanged.
* The values of _, t, n, a, b, i, and work remain unchanged.
* The variable j will be equal to the length of a minus 1.
