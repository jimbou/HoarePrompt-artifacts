Postcondition: ***_ is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is either 1 or 2, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `work` is True, and `counter` is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive, and the value of `counter` is being printed which is either 1 or a value between 2 and `len(a) - 1` inclusive. Additionally, either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, then `ans` also includes the character at index `i` of `b`.***
