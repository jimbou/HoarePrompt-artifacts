Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from stdin, `a` is a non-empty string from stdin with length greater than 0, `b` is a string from stdin, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a`, `i` is 1 if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or the character at index `i` in `b` is not less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `work` is False if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`. Otherwise, `work` is True, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, stdin is empty.***
