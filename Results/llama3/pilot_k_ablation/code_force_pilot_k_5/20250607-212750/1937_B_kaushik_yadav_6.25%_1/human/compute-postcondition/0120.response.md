Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 1, `b` is a string. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` of `a`, then `work` is False, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index 1 of `a`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is 1. If `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, then if `work` is True, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, plus the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or not. `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, and stdin is empty.***
