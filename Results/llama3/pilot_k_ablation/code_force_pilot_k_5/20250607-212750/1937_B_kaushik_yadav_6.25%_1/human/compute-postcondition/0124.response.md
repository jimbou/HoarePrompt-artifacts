Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` has a length greater than 2, `b` is a string, `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or not, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise it is a string that is equal to the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the character at index `i` of `a` to its previous value. The value of `i` is still either 1 or 2, depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or not. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
