Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than or equal to 4, `b` is a string, `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, `i` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `work` is True, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` includes the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a`, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`.**
