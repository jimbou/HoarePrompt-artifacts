The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a. If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is not specified, a is a string with exactly 3 characters. Since a is a string with exactly 3 characters, len(a) is 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be less than 3. 
State: **_* is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string. If work is True, then either ans is a string with 2 characters (the first character of a and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 2, or ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a) and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b and the character at index 1 of a, and i is 1 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 2 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If work is True and i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a), i is 1, and work is False. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b and the character at index 1 of a, and i is 2***
