Postcondition: ***_ is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with at least 5 characters, b is a string. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 6 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 3, and work is False. If i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then if work is True, ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 3, or ans is a string with 6 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 4. If work is False, then if i + 1 < len(a), ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 3 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 4 if i + 1 equals the length of a. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 3, and work is False. If i + 1 does not equal the length of a, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 4 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 5 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string with 5 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a), i is 4, and work is False. And i must be less than 5.***
