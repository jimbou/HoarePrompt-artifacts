Output State: **`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i` are unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, and `counter` is 1.**

In this output state, all variables except `counter` retain their original values. The value of `counter` is reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. The condition that `counter` is either 2 or increased by 1 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` is no longer applicable, as `counter` is now explicitly set to 1.
