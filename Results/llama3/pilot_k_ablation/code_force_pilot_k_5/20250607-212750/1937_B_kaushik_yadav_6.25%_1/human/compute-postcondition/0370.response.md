Output State: **_* is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string, ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if work is True and i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i] if work is True, otherwise ans is a string containing the first character of b plus a[i], i is 0 if work is True and i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise i is 1 plus 1, work is False, the string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, j is not defined.**

The code sets the value of `work` to `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `work` is now explicitly set to `False`.
