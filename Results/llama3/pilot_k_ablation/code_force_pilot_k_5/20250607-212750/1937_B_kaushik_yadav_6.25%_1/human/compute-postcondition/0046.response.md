Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than or equal to 4, `b` is a string, `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `work` is True if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False, and `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and possibly the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` and the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values except for `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `a` to its original value. The value of `ans` still depends on the value of `work`, but now it also includes the character at index `i` of `a`.
