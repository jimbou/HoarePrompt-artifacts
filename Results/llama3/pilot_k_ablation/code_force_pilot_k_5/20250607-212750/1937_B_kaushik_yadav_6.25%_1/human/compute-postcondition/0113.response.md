Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string with length greater than 0, b is a string. If work is True, then ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a plus the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a. Otherwise, ans is a string that is equal to the first character of a plus the character at index i of a, and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string consisting of the first character of b, i is 1, and work is False. j is undefined, counter is undefined, and stdin is empty.**
