Postcondition: ***_ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string, ans is a string, i is 0 or 1, work is False, the string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, j is not defined. If work is True, then ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string, and i is 0 if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, and i is 1.***
