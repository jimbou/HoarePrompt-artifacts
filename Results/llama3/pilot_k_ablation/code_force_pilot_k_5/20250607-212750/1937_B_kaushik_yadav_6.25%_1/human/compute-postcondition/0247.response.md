Postcondition: ***`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i` are unchanged, `j` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', then `counter` is 2. If the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 3. If the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is increased by 1.***
