Postcondition: ***_* is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string. If work is True, then if i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i], and i is 1 plus 1. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, then ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] plus b[i], and i is 0. Otherwise, ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, otherwise ans is a string that is the first character of a plus the empty string plus a[i], and i is 1. If work is False, then ans is a string that is the first character of a plus b[i] plus b[i+1], and i is 2. In all cases, work is False, the string ans is being printed, counter is not defined, and j is not defined.***
