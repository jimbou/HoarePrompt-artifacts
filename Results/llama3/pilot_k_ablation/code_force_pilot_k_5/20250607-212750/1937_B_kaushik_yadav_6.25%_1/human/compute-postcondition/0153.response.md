Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `counter` is either 2 or 3, and an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
