Postcondition: **`_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with exactly 3 characters, `b` is a string. If `work` is True, then either `ans` is a string with 1 character (the first character of `a`) and either `i` is 1 or `i` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, or `ans` is a string with 2 characters (the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`) and `i` is 0. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.**
