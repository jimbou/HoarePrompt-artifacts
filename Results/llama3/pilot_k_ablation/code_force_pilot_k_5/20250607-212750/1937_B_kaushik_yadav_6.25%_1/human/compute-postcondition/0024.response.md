Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 1, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b`, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `work` is True if `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` contains the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`. Otherwise, either `i` is 1 or 2 and `i` is less than the length of `a`, or `b[i-1]` is not less than `a[i]`, or `i` is 1 or 2 and `ans` is equal to the first character of `b`.***
