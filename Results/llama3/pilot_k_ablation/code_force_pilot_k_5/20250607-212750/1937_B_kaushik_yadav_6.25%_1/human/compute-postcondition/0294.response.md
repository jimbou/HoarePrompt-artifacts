Postcondition: ***_* is 3, t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a string with exactly 3 characters, b is a string. If i + 1 equals the length of a, then work is False, ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 1 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 2 if i + 1 equals the length of a. Otherwise, if work is True, then either ans is a string with 3 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is less than 1, or ans is a string with 4 characters (the first character of a, the character at index i of b, the character at index i of a, and the character at index i of a) and i is 2. If work is False, then ans is a string containing the first character of b, the character at index 1 of a, and the character at index i of a, and i is 2 if i + 1 < 2 and b[i] < a[i + 1], or i is 3 if i + 1 equals the length of a.***
