According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 plus 1, and `a` is a non-empty string. `a` being a non-empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` must have a length greater than 1 plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **_*_ is 4, t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer, a must have a length greater than 1 plus 1, b is a string**
