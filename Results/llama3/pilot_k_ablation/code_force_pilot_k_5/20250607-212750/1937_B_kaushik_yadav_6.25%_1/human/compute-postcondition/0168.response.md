Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, an empty string is being printed, `j` is an integer and is at least 4. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.**

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` was 1 and is now 2. Otherwise, `counter` was either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 and is now either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The states of the other variables are not affected.
