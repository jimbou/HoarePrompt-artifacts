The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`_` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `counter` is 1 if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', otherwise the state of `counter` remains unchanged, but if the character at index `j+1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 2**
