Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second and third lines contain a binary string a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n} respectively (a_{1i} and a_{2i} are either 0 or 1). The number of test cases is between 1 and 10^4.**
