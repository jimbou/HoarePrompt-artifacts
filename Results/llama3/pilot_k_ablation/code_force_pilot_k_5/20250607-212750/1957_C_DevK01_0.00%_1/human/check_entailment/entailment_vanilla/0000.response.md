Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the computer mirrors each move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. It defines a recursive function `helper` that takes the length of the remaining board as input and returns the number of possible configurations.

The base case for the recursion is when the length is less than or equal to 0, in which case there is only one possible configuration (i.e., no more moves can be made).

For lengths greater than 0, the function calculates the number of possible configurations by considering two cases:

1. The first case is when the next move is made on the diagonal (i.e., the row and column indices are the same). In this case, the computer cannot mirror the move, and the number of possible configurations is the same as the number of configurations for a board of length `len - 1`.

2. The second case is when the next move is not made on the diagonal. In this case, the computer can mirror the move, and the number of possible configurations is twice the number of configurations for a board of length `len - 2`, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the row and column indices for the move (which is `len - 1`).

The function uses memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

The main function `func_1` simply calls the `helper` function with the input `x` and returns the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. It considers all possible moves and their mirrored counterparts, and it uses memoization to optimize the calculation.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

* The `dp` dictionary is defined in `func_1` but used in `helper`. This is not a problem in this specific case, but it's generally better to define variables in the scope where they are used.
* The program does not handle the case where `x` is not a positive integer. It's a good practice to add input validation to handle such cases.
* The program does not provide any output or explanation for the result. It's a good practice to provide some explanation or output to help the user understand the result.

Overall, the program is correct, but it can be improved with some minor modifications.

Correctness: **True**
