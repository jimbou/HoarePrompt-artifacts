Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to calculate the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. After that, it calls the function func_1 with the updated size of the chessboard as an argument.

The function func_1 is a simple function that just calls another function helper with the same argument. The function helper is a recursive function that calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. It uses a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

The function helper calculates the number of possible final configurations by considering two cases: 
1. The current move is not mirrored by the computer, in which case the number of possible configurations is the same as the number of possible configurations for the remaining (len - 1) moves.
2. The current move is mirrored by the computer, in which case the number of possible configurations is twice the number of possible configurations for the remaining (len - 2) moves, because the computer's move can be either a mirror of the current move or a move that is not a mirror of the current move.

The function helper returns the sum of these two cases, which is the total number of possible final configurations.

The program then prints the result of the function func_1, which is the total number of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7.

Correctness: **True**
