Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The program first reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly.

The program then calls the function `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The function `func_1(n)` is not defined in the given code, but based on the context, it is likely that it calls the function `helper(n)`.

The function `helper(n)` is a recursive function that calculates the number of possible configurations for a chessboard of size n. It uses a dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

The base case of the recursion is when `len` is less than or equal to 0, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function checks if the result for `len` is already stored in the dictionary `dp`. If it is, the function returns the stored result. If not, the function calculates the result by recursively calling itself with `len - 1` and `len - 2`, and stores the result in the dictionary `dp`.

The function then returns the calculated result.

Based on the given code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It correctly updates the size of the chessboard based on the moves already played, and it uses a recursive approach with memoization to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
