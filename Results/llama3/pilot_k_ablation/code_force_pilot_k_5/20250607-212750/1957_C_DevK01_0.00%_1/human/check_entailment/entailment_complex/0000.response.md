Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a chessboard and rooks. The problem requires determining the number of different final configurations possible when continuing a game after a certain number of moves.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `helper`. The `func_1` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result of calling the `helper` function with `n` as an argument.

The `helper` function is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the input `len`, which is a non-negative integer. If `len` is 0 or less, it returns 1. If `len` is already a key in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the associated value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the value using the `helper` function and stores it in `dp` before returning it.

The main part of the program reads input from the user, processes it, and calls the `func_1` function with the processed input. The result of the `func_1` function is then printed.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the recursive function `helper` is properly memoized to avoid redundant calculations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
