Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves, considering the mirroring of moves by the computer. However, the provided program does not take into account the moves made by the computer or the mirroring of moves. It only calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the board without considering the constraints imposed by the computer's moves.

A correct solution would need to consider the moves made by the computer and the mirroring of moves, and calculate the number of possible final configurations based on these constraints. The provided program does not do this, and therefore is incorrect.
