#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a value of any type and value
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the value of x which is of any type and value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter x of any type and value, and returns the same value without modifying it. The function does not perform any actions or transformations on the input value, and its sole purpose is to return the original value of x.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State: len is a non-negative integer, and len is larger than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value associated with the key 'len' in the dictionary 'dp', where 'len' is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is a key in the dictionary 'dp'.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer, len is larger than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2. x1 is the result of helper(len - 1) and x2 is 2 times (len - 1) times the result of helper(len - 2).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a value based on the input 'len', which is a non-negative integer. If 'len' is 0 or less, it returns 1. If 'len' is already a key in the dictionary 'dp', it returns the associated value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the value using the 'helper' function and stores it in 'dp' before returning it. The function effectively memoizes the results of the 'helper' function for different 'len' values.
