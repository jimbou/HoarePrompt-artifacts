Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings that are not palindromes. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

`func_2` takes a string `ch` as input and checks if it can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. It does this by checking the length of the string and its parity (even or odd). Based on the length and parity, it calls `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns a value indicating that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. If the first half is not a palindrome, the function returns a value indicating that the string can be partitioned.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not handle the case where the input string is a single character. In this case, the string is always a palindrome, and the program should return "NO".
2. The program does not handle the case where the input string is a palindrome of even length. In this case, the program should return "NO", but it incorrectly returns "YES" with a partition of length 1.
3. The program does not handle the case where the input string is a palindrome of odd length. In this case, the program should return "NO", but it incorrectly returns "YES" with a partition of length 1.
4. The program does not provide a clear and correct partition of the string into non-palindromic substrings. The values returned by `func_2` are not clearly defined and do not provide a valid partition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
