Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to determine the partitioning of the input string.

The program first checks if the input string is a palindrome or a repeated character string. If it is, the program prints "NO" as there is no valid partition. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to check if the string is a modified palindrome. If it is, the program checks the length of the string and calls `func_2` to determine the value of 'a'.

Based on the value of 'a', the program partitions the string into substrings and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If any substring is a palindrome, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" along with the partitioned substrings.

The execution summaries of `func_1` and `func_2` provide insight into their behavior. `func_1` checks if a string is a modified palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. `func_2` determines the value of 'a' based on the length of the input string and the result of calling `func_1` with the first half of the string as input.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to partition the input string into non-palindromic substrings.

Correctness: **True**
