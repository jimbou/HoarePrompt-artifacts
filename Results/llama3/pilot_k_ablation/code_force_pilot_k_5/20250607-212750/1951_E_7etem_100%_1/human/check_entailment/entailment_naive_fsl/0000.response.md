Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem requires partitioning the input string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. However, the provided program does not attempt to partition the string in any way. Instead, it defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to checking if a string is a palindrome, but they are not used to solve the problem.

For example, if the input string is "abba", the program should output "YES" and partition the string into two substrings "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes. However, the program does not produce this output.

The program seems to be incomplete and does not address the problem statement. Therefore, it is incorrect.
