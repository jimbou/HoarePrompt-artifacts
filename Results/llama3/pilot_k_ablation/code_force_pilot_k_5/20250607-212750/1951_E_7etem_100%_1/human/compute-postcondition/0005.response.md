Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1` is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The function `func_1` returns `False` when called with the first half of the string `ch` as input, `a` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 4, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still even, `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`, and `func_1` still returns `False` when called with the first half of the string `ch` as input.
