Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1` is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.**

In this output state, the value of `b` is calculated as half the length of the string `ch`. The length of `ch` is unknown, but it is a string of lowercase Latin characters. The value of `b` is an integer, which means it will be rounded down if the length of `ch` is odd. The function `func_1` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.
