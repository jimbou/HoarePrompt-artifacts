Output State: **The program returns the value of variable 'a', which is determined by the length of string 'ch' and the result of calling function 'func_1' with the first half of 'ch' as input. If the length of 'ch' is even, 'a' is 3 if 'func_1' returns True, otherwise 'a' is 4. If the length of 'ch' is odd, 'a' is 1 if 'func_1' returns True, otherwise 'a' is 2.**
