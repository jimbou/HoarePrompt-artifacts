You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and func_1 is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if (len(ch) % 2 == 0) :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 3
        else :
            a = 4
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1` is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. If `func_1` returns `True` when called with the first half of the string `ch` as input, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4.
    else :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 1
        else :
            a = 2
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is an odd number, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`. If `func_1` returns `True` when given the first half of `ch` as input, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1` is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. If the length of `ch` is even, then if `func_1` returns `True` when called with the first half of the string `ch` as input, `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, then if `func_1` returns `True` when given the first half of `ch` as input, `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of variable 'a', which is determined by the length of string 'ch' and the result of calling function 'func_1' with the first half of 'ch' as input. If the length of 'ch' is even, 'a' is 3 if 'func_1' returns True, otherwise 'a' is 4. If the length of 'ch' is odd, 'a' is 1 if 'func_1' returns True, otherwise 'a' is 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of variable 'a', which is determined by the length of string 'ch' and the result of calling function 'func_1' with the first half of 'ch' as input. If the length of 'ch' is even, 'a' is 3 if 'func_1' returns True, otherwise 'a' is 4. If the length of 'ch' is odd, 'a' is 1 if 'func_1' returns True, otherwise 'a' is 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
