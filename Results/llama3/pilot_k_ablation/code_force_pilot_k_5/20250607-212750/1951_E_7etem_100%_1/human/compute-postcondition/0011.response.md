Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1` is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The length of `ch` is an odd number. `func_1` returns `False` when given the first half of `ch` as input. `a` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 2, while the values of `ch`, `b`, and `func_1` remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still an odd number, and `func_1` still returns `False` when given the first half of `ch` as input.
