Postcondition: ***`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1` is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. If `func_1` returns `True` when called with the first half of the string `ch` as input, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4.***
