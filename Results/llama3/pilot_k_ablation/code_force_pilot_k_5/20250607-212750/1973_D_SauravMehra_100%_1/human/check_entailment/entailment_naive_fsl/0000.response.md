Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the maximum value `mx` is not a multiple of `k`. In this case, the program will not be able to find a valid `tar` value that satisfies the condition `func_1(tar, k, n)`.

For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The maximum value `mx` is 10, but 10 is not a multiple of 3. In this case, the program will not be able to find a valid `tar` value and will incorrectly output `-1`.

To fix this issue, the program needs to handle the case where `mx` is not a multiple of `k` and find a valid `tar` value that satisfies the condition `func_1(tar, k, n)`.
