Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m. 

The program first finds the maximum possible value of m by querying the function f(1, n) with increasing values of m until it finds a value that returns n. It then iteratively decreases the value of m by the maximum value found and checks if the current value of m can be achieved by splitting the array into k subarrays using the function func_1. 

The function func_1 takes a target value tar, the number of subarrays k, and the length of the array n as input. It iteratively queries the function f(l, r) with increasing values of l and checks if the returned value r is equal to n + 1. If it is, the function returns False. Otherwise, it updates the indices ind and it based on the returned value r and checks if the final values of ind and it are equal to n and k, respectively. 

The program correctly handles the case where no such m exists by printing -1 and exiting the program if the user input is -1.

Correctness: **True**
