Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`.

The program first finds the maximum possible value of `m` by querying the maximum value of the array and then iteratively decreasing it until it finds a value that can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays.

The `func_1` function is used to check if a given value `tar` can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays. It iteratively queries the user for input `x` and updates the indices `ind` and `it` based on the input. If the user input `x` is equal to `n + 1` at any point, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the final values of `ind` and `it` are equal to `n` and `k`, respectively.

This does not cover the logic described by the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
