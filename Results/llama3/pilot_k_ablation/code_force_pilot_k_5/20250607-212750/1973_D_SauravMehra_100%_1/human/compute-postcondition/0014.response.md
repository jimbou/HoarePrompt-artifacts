According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `it`. If `ind` is less than `n` and `it` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `it` is 0, and `k` is greater than 0. Since `ind` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, we can be certain that `ind` is less than `n`. However, we cannot be certain that `it` is less than `k` because `it` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0, but we do not know the exact value of `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? [ind + 1] [tar]" where [ind + 1] is 1 and [tar] is the value of tar**
