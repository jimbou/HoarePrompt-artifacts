Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether `ind` is equal to `n` and `it` is equal to `k`. Since `ind` is `n` and `it` is `k`, the program returns `True`.**

In natural language, the program returns `True` because both conditions `ind == n` and `it == k` are met, given that `ind` is initialized as `n` and `it` is initialized as `k`.
