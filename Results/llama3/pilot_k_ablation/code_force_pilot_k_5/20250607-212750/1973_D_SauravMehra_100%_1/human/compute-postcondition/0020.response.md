Output State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is `k`, `ind` is `n`, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input because it has been used to get the value of `x`, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `tar`, `k`, and `n` remain positive integers within the given range. The variable `it` has reached the value of `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. The variable `ind` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements. The variable `x` is an integer that is not equal to `n + 1`, and the stdin contains no input because it has been used to get the value of `x`.
