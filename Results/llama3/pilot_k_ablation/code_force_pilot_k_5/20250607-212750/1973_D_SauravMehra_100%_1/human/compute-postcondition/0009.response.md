The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `ind + 1`, and the value of `tar`. 

`ind` is 0 and `tar` is a positive integer. 

Therefore, the output will be a string containing a question mark, the value 1 (which is the result of `ind + 1`), and the value of `tar`.

Output: **? 1 [tar] (where tar is the value of tar)**
