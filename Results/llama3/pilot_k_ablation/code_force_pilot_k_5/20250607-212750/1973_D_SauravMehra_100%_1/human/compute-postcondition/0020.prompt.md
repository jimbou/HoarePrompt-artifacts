Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, it is 0, ind is 0
Code of the loop:
while ind < n and it < k:
    print(f'? {ind + 1} {tar}')
    x = int(input())
    if x == n + 1:
        return False
    ind = x
    it += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input because it has been used to get the value of `x`, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input because it has been used to get the value of `x`, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? [ind + 1] [tar]" where [ind + 1] is 1 and [tar] is the value of tar
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? [ind + 1] [tar]" where [ind + 1] is 1 and [tar] is the value of tar
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? 1 [tar]" where [tar] is the value of tar
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, the stdin contains no input, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? [ind + 1] [tar]" where ind + 1 is 1 and tar is the value of tar


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
