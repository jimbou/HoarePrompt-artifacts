Based on the precondition, the code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `ind + 1`, and the value of `tar`.

Since `ind` is 0, `ind + 1` will be 1. The value of `tar` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.

Output: **? 1 [tar] (where tar is a positive integer)**
