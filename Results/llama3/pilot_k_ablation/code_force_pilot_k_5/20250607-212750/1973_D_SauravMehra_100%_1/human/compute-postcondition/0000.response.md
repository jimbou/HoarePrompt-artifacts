Output State: **tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, it is 0, ind is 0**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `it` and `ind`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `tar`, `k`, and `n` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The conditions 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 also remain valid, as the code does not affect these constraints.
