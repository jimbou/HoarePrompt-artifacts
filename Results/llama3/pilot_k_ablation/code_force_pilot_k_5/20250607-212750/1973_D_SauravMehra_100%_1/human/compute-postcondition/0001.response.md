To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `ind < n and it < k`.

Given the initial states:
- `tar` is a positive integer (no direct impact on the loop condition)
- `k` is a positive integer
- `n` is a positive integer
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4` (constraints on `k` and `n`)
- `it` is 0
- `ind` is 0

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `ind < n`
2. `it < k`

Since `ind` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer with `1 <= n <= 10^4`, the first condition `ind < n` is always true given the initial state of `ind` and the constraints on `n`.

For the second condition `it < k`, since `it` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, this condition is also true because 0 is less than any positive integer.

Given these considerations, no adjustments are necessary to the states of `ind`, `n`, `it`, or `k` for the loop to execute the first time, as the initial states and constraints already satisfy the loop conditions.

State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0**
