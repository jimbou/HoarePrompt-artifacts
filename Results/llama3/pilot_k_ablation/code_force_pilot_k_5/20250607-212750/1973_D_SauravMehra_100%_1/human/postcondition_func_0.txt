This function takes three positive integers as input: `tar`, `k`, and `n`, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`. It iteratively prompts the user for input `x` and updates the indices `ind` and `it` based on the input. The function returns `False` if the user input `x` is equal to `n + 1` at any point. Otherwise, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the final values of `ind` and `it` are equal to `n` and `k`, respectively.
