Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the numbers and prints them accordingly. The program handles all possible cases, including when x is less than y, x is equal to y, and x is greater than y. The program also handles the edge cases where x and y are 0. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
