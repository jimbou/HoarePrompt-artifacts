Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. The program handles all possible cases, including when `a` is less than `b`, when `a` is equal to `b`, and when `a` is greater than `b`. The program also produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
