Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it takes two integers as input and outputs the minimum and maximum of the two integers. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the output.

The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers (a and b) and checks if a is less than b. If true, it prints a and b in that order. If a is equal to b, it prints them in the same order. If a is greater than b, it prints b and a in that order.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads the input, processes it, and produces the correct output.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
