Based on the precondition, the code will print the values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` equals `b` and both are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, the output will be two identical integers.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
