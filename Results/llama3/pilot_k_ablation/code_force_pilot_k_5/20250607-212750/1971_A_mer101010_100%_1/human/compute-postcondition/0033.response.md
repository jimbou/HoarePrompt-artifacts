Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `a` and `b` are the first two integers from the input, stdin contains n-5 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If the first integer from the input is less than the second integer from the input, then the values of the first integer and the second integer are printed. If the first integer from the input is greater than or equal to the second integer from the input, then the values of the second integer and the first integer are printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `b` and `a` are printed.**
