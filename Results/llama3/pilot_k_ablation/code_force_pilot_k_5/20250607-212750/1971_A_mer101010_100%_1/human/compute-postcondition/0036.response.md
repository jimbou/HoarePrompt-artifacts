Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains n-6 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads the first two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `a` and `b` are already defined as integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, their values are updated to the new input values. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-6` lines, as the first line has been consumed by the input operation.
