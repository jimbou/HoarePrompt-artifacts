Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, t is 0, stdin contains n lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, which is the value of the first input from stdin. The value of `t` is 0, which is assigned in the second line of the code. Stdin still contains n lines, each with two space-separated integers x and y, as only the first input was consumed by the code.
