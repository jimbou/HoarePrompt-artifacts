Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `t` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin is empty. The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with `a` printed first if `a` is less than `b`, and `b` printed first otherwise.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 0. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and they will be printed in the correct order (either `a` followed by `b` if `a` is less than `b`, or `b` followed by `a` otherwise). The input stream will be empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
