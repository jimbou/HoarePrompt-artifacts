Based on the precondition, the code will print the current values of `a` and `b`.

Since `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `b` is also an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`, the output will be two integers, where the first integer is less than the second integer.

Output: **a (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), b (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, where a < b)**
