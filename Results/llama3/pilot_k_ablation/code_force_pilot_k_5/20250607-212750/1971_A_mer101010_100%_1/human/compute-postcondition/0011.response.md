The code prints the values of variables `b` and `a`. 
`b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. 
`a` is not less than `b`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. 
This means `a` is greater than `b`.
Output: **b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and a > b)**
