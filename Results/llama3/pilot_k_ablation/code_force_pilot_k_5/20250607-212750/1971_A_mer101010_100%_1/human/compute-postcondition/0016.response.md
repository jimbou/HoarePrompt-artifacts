Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two space-separated integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The stdin now contains n-3 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
