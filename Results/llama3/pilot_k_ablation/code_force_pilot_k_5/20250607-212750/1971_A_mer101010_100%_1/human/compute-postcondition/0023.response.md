Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `a` equals `b`, then `a` and `b` are printed. Otherwise, `b` and `a` are printed.***
