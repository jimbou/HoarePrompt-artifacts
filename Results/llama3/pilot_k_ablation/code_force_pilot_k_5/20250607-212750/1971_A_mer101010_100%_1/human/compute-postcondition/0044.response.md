Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains n-6 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `a` is less than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `b` and `a` are printed.**
