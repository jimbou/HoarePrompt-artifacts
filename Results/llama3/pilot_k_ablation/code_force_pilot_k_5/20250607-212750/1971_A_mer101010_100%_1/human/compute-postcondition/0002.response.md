Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two space-separated integers from the first line of the input, which are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The stdin now contains n-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers.
