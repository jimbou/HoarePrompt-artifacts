Based on the initial state, the code `print(b, a)` will print the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Since the exact values of `b` and `a` are not specified, we can't provide a numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[b], [a] (where b and a are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
