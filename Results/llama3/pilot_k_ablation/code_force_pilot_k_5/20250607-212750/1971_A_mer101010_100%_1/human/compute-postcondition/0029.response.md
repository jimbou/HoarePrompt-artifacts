Based on the precondition, the values of `a` and `b` are the first two integers from the input, and their values are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The print statement simply prints the values of `a` and `b`.

Since the precondition does not specify the exact values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **a (the first integer from the input) and b (the second integer from the input), where a and b are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive**
