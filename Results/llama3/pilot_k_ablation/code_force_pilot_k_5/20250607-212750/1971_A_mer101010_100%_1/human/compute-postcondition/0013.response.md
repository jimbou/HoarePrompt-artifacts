Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `a` is not less than `b`. If `a` equals `b`, then "a equals to b" is printed, where `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then "b and a" is printed.***
