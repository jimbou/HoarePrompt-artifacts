Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has either one less element than before or one more element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with either `m` elements or `m+1` elements. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, the code inside the if statement is executed.***
