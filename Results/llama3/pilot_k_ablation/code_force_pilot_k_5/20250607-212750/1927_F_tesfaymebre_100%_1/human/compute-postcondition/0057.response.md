Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least one more element, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing start+1 elements, prev is a dictionary with start+2 elements, nei is nei_next. If node is equal to start and nei is equal to end, then the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the value of nei is added to the deque que and the value of node is assigned to prev[nei].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `que` deque now contains `start+1` elements, including the newly added `nei` element. The `prev` dictionary now has `start+2` elements, with the new key-value pair being `nei` mapped to `node`. The value of `nei` is updated to `nei_next`. The loop skips to the next iteration if `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, otherwise, the changes to `que` and `prev` are made.
