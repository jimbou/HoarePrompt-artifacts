To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change. The loop head is `for (w, u, v) in edges:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `w`, `u`, `v`, and `edges`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more edges in the `edges` list. At the end of the last iteration, `edges` contains at least 2 edges. For the loop to execute again, `edges` must have at least 3 edges.

Since `w`, `u`, and `v` are assigned values from the `edges` list, their values will change in the next iteration. However, we cannot determine their exact values without knowing the contents of the `edges` list. We can only say that they will be assigned new values from the next edge in the list.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `dsu`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 3 edges, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, `_min_edge` is `w` if the parent of `u` in the `dsu` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, otherwise `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is `u` if the parent of `u` in the `dsu` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, otherwise `start` is -1, `end` is `v` if the parent of `u` in the `dsu` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, otherwise `end` is -1, `w`, `u`, and `v` are assigned new values from the next edge in the `edges` list**
