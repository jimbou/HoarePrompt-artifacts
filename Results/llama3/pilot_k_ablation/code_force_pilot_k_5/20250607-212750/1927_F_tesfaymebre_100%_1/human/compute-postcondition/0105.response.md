Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 5 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 3 elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, the state of `que` and `prev` remains unchanged.***
