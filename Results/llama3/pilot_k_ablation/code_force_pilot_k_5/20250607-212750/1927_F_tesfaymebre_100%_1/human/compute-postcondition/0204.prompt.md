Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing start, and prev is a dictionary with start mapped to -1.
Code of the loop:
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `m-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least `m-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least `m-1` elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, the state of `que` and `prev` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the last element that was in `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m` elements and `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is `end`, and `nei` is the last neighbor in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least `m` keys that must have at least `m` neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the last neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`, and `que` contains `nei`. Otherwise, no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
