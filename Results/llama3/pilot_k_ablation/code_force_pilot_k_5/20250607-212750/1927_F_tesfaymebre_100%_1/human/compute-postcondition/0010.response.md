Output State: **`test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()` that must be greater than 4 and `func_6()` has been executed six times**

The code executes the function `func_6()`, which has already been executed five times in the initial state. After executing it again, the total number of executions of `func_6()` becomes six. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the execution of `func_6()`. Therefore, the output state is that `test_cases` is still a value returned by `func_1()` that must be greater than 4, and `func_6()` has now been executed six times.
