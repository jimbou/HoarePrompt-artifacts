To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `nei` and `graph[node]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nei` is the third element in `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must have at least 4 elements, and `nei` must be the fourth element in `graph[node]`.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `m`, `i`, `edges`, `dsu`, `que`, and `node`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 4 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 1 element, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`.**
