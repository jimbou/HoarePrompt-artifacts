Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, `_min_edge` is `w` if the parent of `u` in the `dsu` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, otherwise `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is `u` if the parent of `u` in the `dsu` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, otherwise `start` is -1, `end` is `v` if the parent of `u` in the `dsu` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, otherwise `end` is -1, and the parents of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` are now the same.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the parents of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` are now merged into a single parent. This means that if `u` and `v` were previously in different sets, they are now in the same set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
