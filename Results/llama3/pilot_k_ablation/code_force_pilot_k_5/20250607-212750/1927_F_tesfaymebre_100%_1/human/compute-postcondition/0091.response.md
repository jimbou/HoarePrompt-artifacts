The only objects in the loop head are variables  nei and graph[node], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[node].  If the graph[node] has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[node] has at least 2 elements, nei is the second element in the list,  So for the loop to be executed one more time the graph[node] must have at least 3 elements and the nei is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 1 element, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, nei is the third element in the list.**
