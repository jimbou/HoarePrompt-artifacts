Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`, the value of `u` to `start`, and the value of `v` to `end`. No other variables are affected. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
