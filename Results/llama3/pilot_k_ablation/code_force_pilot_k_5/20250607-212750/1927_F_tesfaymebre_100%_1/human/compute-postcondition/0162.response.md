Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements, `que` has one more element than before and the value of `nei` in `prev` is now `node`. If `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, then we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
