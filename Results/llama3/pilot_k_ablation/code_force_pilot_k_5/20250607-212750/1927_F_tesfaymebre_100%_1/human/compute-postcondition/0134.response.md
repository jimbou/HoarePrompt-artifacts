Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 5 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 2 elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the fifth element in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. If `nei` is in `prev`, then no changes are made.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `node`, `nei`, `prev`, and `que` also remain the same, as no changes were made to these variables.
