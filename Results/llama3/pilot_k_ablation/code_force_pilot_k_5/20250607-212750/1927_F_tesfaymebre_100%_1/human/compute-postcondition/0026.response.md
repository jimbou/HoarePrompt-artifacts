Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu, _min_edge is w if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise _min_edge is positive infinity, start is u if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise start is -1, end is v if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise end is -1, w, u, and v are assigned new values from the next edge in the edges list.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that find the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` using the `find` method. The `parent_u` and `parent_v` variables are updated with the results of these operations. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `edges` list still contains at least 2 edges, and the `graph` dictionary remains unchanged. The `i` variable is still equal to `m-1`, and the `n` and `m` variables retain their original values. The `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` variables are not modified by the code snippet.
