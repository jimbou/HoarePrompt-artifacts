Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, (w, u, v) is the first edge in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The code only assigns the parents of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` to `parent_u` and `parent_v`, respectively.
