Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least 1 element, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing at least 1 element, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is a key in the dictionary graph, nei is the first element in the list graph[node], and prev[nei] is node.**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows: the dictionary `prev` now contains an additional key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`, and the deque `que` now contains an additional element `nei`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
