To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `nei` and `graph[node]`. The loop will execute if `graph[node]` is not empty. Since `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, we can assume that `node` is one of the keys in `graph`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `graph[node]` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` mapped to `-1`, and if the current value of `node` is equal to `end`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
