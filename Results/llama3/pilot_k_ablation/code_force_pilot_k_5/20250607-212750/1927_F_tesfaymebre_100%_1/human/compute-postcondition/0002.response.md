Output State: **`test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()` that must be greater than 0 and `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged as it was returned by `func_1()` and must be greater than 0. The code snippet only executes `func_6()`, but does not modify or assign any new values to `test_cases`. Therefore, the state of `test_cases` remains the same. Additionally, the execution of `func_6()` is acknowledged in the output state.
