Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `(w, u, v)` is the first edge in the list, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu`, and `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`**.

In this output state, the `dsu.union(u, v)` operation has merged the sets containing `u` and `v` into a single set, making `parent_u` and `parent_v` equal. The other variables remain unchanged.
