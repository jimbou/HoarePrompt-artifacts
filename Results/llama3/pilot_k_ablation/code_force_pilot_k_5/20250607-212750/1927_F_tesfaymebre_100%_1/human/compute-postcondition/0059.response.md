The only objects in the loop head are variables  `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[node]`.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least one element, `nei` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `nei` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least two elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` is a deque containing `start+1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+2` elements, `nei` is the second element in `graph[node]`, the value of `nei` is added to the deque `que` and the value of `node` is assigned to `prev[nei]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
