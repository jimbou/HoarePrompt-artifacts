Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que has increased in size by 1, prev has increased in size by 1, node is a key in the graph, nei is the second neighbor of the node, prev[nei] is node.**

The code modifies the state of the program by updating the values of `prev`, `que`, and the relationships between `node` and `nei`. The `prev` dictionary now contains an additional key-value pair, where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. The `que` list has increased in size by 1, with `nei` appended to it. The relationship between `node` and `nei` is established, where `nei` is the second neighbor of `node`. All other variables remain unchanged.
