Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the leftmost element that was previously in `que`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `que`, `prev`, and `node` remain unchanged.
