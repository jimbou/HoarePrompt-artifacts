Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements where `prev[nei]` is now `node`, `que` has one more element than before which is `nei`.**

The code snippet modifies the `prev` dictionary by assigning the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`, and appends `nei` to the `que` list. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged.
