Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is an empty list, and curr is end.
Code of the loop:
while curr != -1:
    path.append(curr)
    curr = prev[curr]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, and curr is the value of prev[curr].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr and the value of prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[prev[curr]].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr].
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr] and prev[curr] is not equal to -1
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr] and prev[curr] is not equal to -1 and the value of prev[curr] must not be -1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
