According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable curr. If curr is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, curr is end. So for the loop to execute the first time, curr must not be -1.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is an empty list, and curr is not -1**
