Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr] and prev[curr] is not equal to -1**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `curr` to the `path` list. Since `curr` is the value of `prev[curr]`, this means that the `path` list now contains the value of `prev[curr]`, in addition to its original values. The second line assigns the value of `prev[curr]` to `curr`. Since `prev[curr]` is not equal to -1, this means that `curr` now has a new value, which is the value of `prev[curr]`. 

No other variables are affected by the code block. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `que`, `node`, and `nei` remain unchanged.
