Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty and has one less element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the second last element that was in `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has either one less element than before or one more element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with either `m` elements or `m+1` elements, the current value of `node` is the second last element that was in `que` and is not equal to `end`, and the current value of `nei` is the first neighbor in the list. If the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is added to `prev` with a value of `node` and `que` has one more element than before. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has one more element than before and `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev` and `node` is not equal to `start` or `nei` is not equal to `end`, then `que` has one more element than before and the value of `nei` in `prev` is now `node`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` is updated with `prev[nei]` set to `node` and `que` has one more element which is `nei`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `prev` and `que`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If the neighbor `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has two elements which are `node` and `nei`, and `prev` is updated with `prev[nei]` set to `node` and `prev[node]` set to `None`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
