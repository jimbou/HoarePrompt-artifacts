Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, and if `node` is equal to `end`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes to the variables.***
