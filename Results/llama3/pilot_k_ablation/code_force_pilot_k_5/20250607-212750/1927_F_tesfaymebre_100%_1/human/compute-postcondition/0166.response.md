Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `nei` is the second neighbor of the node, `que` has one more element which is `nei`, `prev` is updated with `prev[nei]` set to `node` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration, without changing any variable values.
