Output State: **`test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()` that must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations and `func_6()` has been executed the same number of times as the number of iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` will be the same as the number of iterations, and the function `func_6()` will have been executed the same number of times as the number of iterations.
