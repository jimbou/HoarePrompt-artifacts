Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, and if `node` is equal to `end`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes to the variables.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is a key in the dictionary `graph` and `nei` is the first element in the list `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 1 element, and `prev[nei]` is `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 1 element, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 1 element, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 2 elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 4 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 2 elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, `que` contains at least 1 element and `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 5 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 3 elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, the state of `que` and `prev` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
