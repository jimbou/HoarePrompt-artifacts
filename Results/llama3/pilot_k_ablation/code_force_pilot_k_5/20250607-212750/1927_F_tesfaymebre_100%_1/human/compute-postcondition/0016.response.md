Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, (w, u, v) is the first edge in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu. The current value of parent_u is equal to the current value of parent_v.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`, making it equal to the weight of the first edge in the list. It also assigns the values of `u` and `v` to `start` and `end`, respectively, indicating the starting and ending vertices of the first edge. No other variables are affected.
