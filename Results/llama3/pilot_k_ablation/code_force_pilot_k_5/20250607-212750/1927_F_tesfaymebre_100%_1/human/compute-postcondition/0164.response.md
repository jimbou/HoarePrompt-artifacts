Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` is updated with `prev[nei]` set to `node` and `que` has one more element which is `nei`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `prev` and `que`.***
