Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least four elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start+2` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+3` elements, and `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
