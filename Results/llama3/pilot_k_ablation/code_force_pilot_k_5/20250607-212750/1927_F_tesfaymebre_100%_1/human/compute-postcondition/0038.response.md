Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the same, `_min_edge` is `w`, `start` is `u`, and `end` is `v`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, and `edges` remain unchanged. The `dsu` instance now has `u` and `v` in the same set. Since the parent of `u` and the parent of `v` in the `dsu` are the same, the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain the same as their previous values, which are `w`, `u`, and `v` respectively.
