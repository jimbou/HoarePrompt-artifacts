Output State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing all the values of curr from the start to the end of the loop, and curr is -1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the path list contains all the values of curr from the start to the end of the loop, and curr is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables remain unchanged.
