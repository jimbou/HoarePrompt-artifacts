To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `nei`, `graph`, and `node`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` and the current `node`. If the `graph` has at least one more neighbor for the current `node`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node. `node` is a key in the graph, and `nei` is the first neighbor of the node and is now in `prev` if `nei` is not in `prev`.

For the loop to execute again, the `graph` must still have at least one more neighbor for the current `node`, and `nei` must be the next neighbor in the list. Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `nei` is the second neighbor of the node (since the first neighbor is already in `prev`).
* `graph` remains the same, as the number of keys and neighbors does not change.
* `node` remains the same, as the current node does not change.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `edges`, `dsu`, `que`, and `prev`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise its size is reduced by 1, `prev` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise it remains the same, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the second neighbor of the node**
