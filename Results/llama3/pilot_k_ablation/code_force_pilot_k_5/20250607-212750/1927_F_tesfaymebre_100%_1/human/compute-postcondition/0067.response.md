Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least three elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing start+2 elements, prev is a dictionary with start+3 elements, and nei is the third element in graph[node].**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `que` deque now contains `start+2` elements, including the newly added `nei` value. The `prev` dictionary has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. The `nei` variable now holds the third element of the list in `graph[node]`.
