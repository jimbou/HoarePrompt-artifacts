Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu, _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v.**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`. The value of `_min_edge` is updated to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of the other variables remains the same.
