To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `graph` and `node`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. So for the loop to be executed, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 element and `nei` is the first element in the list `graph[node]`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is a key in the dictionary `graph` and `nei` is the first element in the list `graph[node]`.**
