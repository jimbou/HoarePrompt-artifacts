Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least `m` keys that must have at least `m` neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the last neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`, and `que` contains `nei`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `prev` dictionary will contain all the neighbors of the node as keys and their corresponding parent nodes as values, and the `que` will contain all the neighbors of the node that were not already in `prev`. The `graph` dictionary will remain unchanged, and the `edges` list will still be empty. The `dsu` instance will still have `n+1` as the input, and the `node` will still be a key in the graph. The `nei` will be the last neighbor of the node.
