Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise its size is reduced by 1, `prev` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise it remains the same, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the second neighbor of the node, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the conditions on the variables are still the same. The loop will continue with the next iteration, skipping the rest of the code in the current iteration.
