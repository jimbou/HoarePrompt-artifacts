Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, and `node` is the first element in the queue `que` which was previously not equal to `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `node` has been updated to the first element in the queue `que`, which was previously not equal to `end`. The size of the queue `que` has been reduced by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
