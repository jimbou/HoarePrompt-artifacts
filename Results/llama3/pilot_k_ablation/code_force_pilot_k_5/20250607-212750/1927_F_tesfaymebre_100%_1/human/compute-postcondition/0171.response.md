The variable in the loop head is variable que, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable que.  If que is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, que is empty, So for the loop to be executed one more time que must not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is `end`, and `nei` is the last neighbor in the list.**
