Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least 5 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que contains at least 3 elements, prev is a dictionary with m+1 elements, where prev[nei] is node.**

The code modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair, where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. This increases the number of elements in `prev` by 1, making it a dictionary with `m+1` elements. Additionally, the code appends `nei` to the `que` list, increasing its size by at least 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
