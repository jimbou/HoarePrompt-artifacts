Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the dsu are the same, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu, and _min_edge, start, and end are either updated or remain the same as their previous values.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the edges in the `edges` list, and the `dsu` instance has been updated accordingly. The `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` variables have been updated to reflect the minimum edge weight and the corresponding start and end vertices, if any. The `graph` and `i` variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
