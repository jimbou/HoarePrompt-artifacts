Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least 3 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing at least 2 elements, prev is a dictionary with m+1 elements, where prev[nei] is node.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `que` deque now contains at least 2 elements, as `nei` is appended to it. The `prev` dictionary now has `m+1` elements, with the additional element being `prev[nei] = node`.
