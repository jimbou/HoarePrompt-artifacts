Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 3 keys that must have at least 3 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the third neighbor of the node, `prev[nei]` is `node`, `que` contains `nei`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `node` and `nei` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. However, the value of `prev[nei]` is updated to `node` and `que` now contains `nei`.
