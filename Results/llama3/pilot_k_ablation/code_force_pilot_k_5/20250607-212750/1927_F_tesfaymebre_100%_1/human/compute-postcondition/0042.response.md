To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that allows the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while que:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `que` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`
- `i` is `m-1`
- `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys
- `edges` is an empty list
- `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input
- `que` is a deque containing `start`
- `prev` is a dictionary with `start` mapped to `-1`

The only variable in the loop head is `que`. For the loop to execute the first time, `que` must not be empty. Since `que` is already described as containing `start`, it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `que` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start`, and `prev` is a dictionary with `start` mapped to `-1`.**
