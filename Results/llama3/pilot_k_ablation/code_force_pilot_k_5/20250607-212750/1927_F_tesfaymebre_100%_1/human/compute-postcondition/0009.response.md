According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 4.
State: **`test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()` that must be greater than 4 and `func_6()` has been executed five times**
