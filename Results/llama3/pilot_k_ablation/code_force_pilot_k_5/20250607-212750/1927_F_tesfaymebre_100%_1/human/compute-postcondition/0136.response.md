Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] has at least 5 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, prev[nei] is node, and que contains at least 3 elements, with nei as the last element.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `prev` dictionary is updated with a new key-value pair, where `nei` is the key and `node` is the value. The `que` list is also updated by appending `nei` to it, making it contain at least 3 elements, with `nei` as the last element.
