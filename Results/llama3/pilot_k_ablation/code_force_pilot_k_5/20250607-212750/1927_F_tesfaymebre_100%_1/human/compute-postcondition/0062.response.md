Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least two elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, prev is a dictionary with start+2 elements, que is a deque containing start+1 elements, prev[nei] is node, and que contains nei.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged from the initial state. The `prev` dictionary now has `start+2` elements, including the newly added key-value pair `prev[nei] = node`. The `que` deque now contains `start+1` elements, including the newly added element `nei`. The value of `nei` is the second element in `graph[node]`.
