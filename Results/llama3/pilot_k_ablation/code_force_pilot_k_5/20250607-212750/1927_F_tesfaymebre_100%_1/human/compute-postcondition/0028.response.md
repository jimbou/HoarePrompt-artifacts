Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input and `u` and `v` are now in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` which is the same as `parent_v`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu` which is the same as `parent_u`, `_min_edge` is `w` if `w` is less than the previous value of `_min_edge`, otherwise `_min_edge` is the previous value of `_min_edge`, `start` is `u` if `w` is less than the previous value of `_min_edge`, otherwise `start` is the previous value of `start`, `end` is `v` if `w` is less than the previous value of `_min_edge`, otherwise `end` is the previous value of `end`, `w`, `u`, and `v` are assigned new values from the next edge in the `edges` list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of nodes `n` and the number of vertices `m` remain the same. The graph and the list of edges also remain unchanged. The DSU instance now has `u` and `v` in the same set. The parent of `u` and `v` in the DSU is the same. The minimum edge weight `_min_edge` is updated to be the minimum of the current edge weight `w` and the previous minimum edge weight. The start and end nodes are updated accordingly. The next edge in the list is assigned to `w`, `u`, and `v`.
