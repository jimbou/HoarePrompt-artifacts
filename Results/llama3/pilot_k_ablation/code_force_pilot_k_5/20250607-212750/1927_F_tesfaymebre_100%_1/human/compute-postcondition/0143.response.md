According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `graph` and `node`. If the graph has at least 1 neighbor for the node, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty and has one less element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the second last element that was in `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. So for the loop to be executed  the graph must have at least 1 neighbor for the node and the node is not equal to `end` and the neighbor is the first neighbor in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty and has one less element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the second last element that was in `que` and is not equal to `end`, `nei` is the first neighbor in the list**
