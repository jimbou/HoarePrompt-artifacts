Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing start, and prev is a dictionary with start mapped to -1.**

The code creates a deque named que and initializes it with the value of start. It also creates a dictionary named prev and initializes it with start mapped to -1. The values of n, m, i, graph, edges, and dsu remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The DSU instance remains the same, with the parent of u and the parent of v being the same if they were initially in the same set, and u and v being in the same set if they were not initially in the same set. The values of _min_edge, start, and end also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
