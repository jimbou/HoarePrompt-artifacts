Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `m-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the graph has been fully traversed, with each node having been visited and added to the `prev` dictionary, and all neighboring nodes have been added to the `que` deque. The `edges` list remains empty, and the `dsu` instance remains unchanged. The `graph` dictionary remains the same, with each node having a list of its neighboring nodes. The `i` variable remains at `m-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
