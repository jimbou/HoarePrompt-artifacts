Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least one more element, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+1` elements, `nei` is `nei_next`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to any variables. The `continue` statement simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without modifying any variables or data structures.
