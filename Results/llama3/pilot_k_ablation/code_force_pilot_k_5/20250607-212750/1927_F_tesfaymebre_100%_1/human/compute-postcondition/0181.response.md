Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise its size is reduced by 1, `prev` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise it remains the same, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the first neighbor of the node and is now in `prev` if `nei` is not in `prev`, and if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, then the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is moved to.***
