Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is an empty list, and curr is end.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the queue remains empty, and the `prev` dictionary still contains all the nodes in the graph as keys, with their corresponding previous nodes as values. The `node` variable is still set to the `end` node, and the `nei` variable is still set to the last neighbor of the `end` node. Two new variables are introduced: `path` is an empty list, and `curr` is set to the `end` node. The other variables remain unchanged.
