Output: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing all the values of curr from the start to the end of the loop, and curr is -1, and this is printed: the minimum edge _min_edge and the length of the path which is the number of elements in the path list**
