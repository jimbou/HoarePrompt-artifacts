Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] has at least 4 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que contains at least 2 elements, node is the first element that was in que, nei is the fourth element in graph[node], prev[nei] is node.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, and `node` remain unchanged. The `que` now contains at least 2 elements, with `nei` being the newly added element. The `prev` dictionary has been updated to include the key-value pair `[nei]: node`, indicating that `node` is the previous node in the path to `nei`.
