Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 1 element, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, nei is the third element in the list. We skip the current iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have skipped the current iteration of the loop.
