Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least three elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` is a deque containing `start+1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+2` elements, `nei` is the third element in `graph[node]`, the value of `nei` is added to the deque `que` and the value of `node` is assigned to `prev[nei]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement does not change any variable values. It only skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration.
