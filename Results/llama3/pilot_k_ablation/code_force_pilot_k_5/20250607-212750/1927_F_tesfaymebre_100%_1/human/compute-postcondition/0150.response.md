The only objects in the loop head are variables  nei and graph and node, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[node].  If the list has at least 2 neighbors the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[node] has at least 1 neighbor, nei is the first neighbor in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 neighbors and the nei is the second neighbor in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has either one less element than before or one more element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with either `m` elements or `m+1` elements, the current value of `node` is the second last element that was in `que` and is not equal to `end`, and the current value of `nei` is the second neighbor in the list.**
