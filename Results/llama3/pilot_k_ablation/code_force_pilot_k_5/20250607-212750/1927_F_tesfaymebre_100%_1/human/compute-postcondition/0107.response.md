The only variable in the loop head is variable que, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable que.  If que is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, que is a deque containing at least `m-1` elements, So for the loop to be executed one more time que must contain at least 1 element.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 1 element, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least `m-1` elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, the state of `que` and `prev` remains unchanged.**
