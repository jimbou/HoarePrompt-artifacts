Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the last element that was in `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m` elements and `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue `que` is empty, and the `prev` dictionary has been populated with all the nodes in the graph, with each node's previous node set to the node that was visited before it. The `node` variable is set to the last node that was visited. The other variables remain unchanged.
