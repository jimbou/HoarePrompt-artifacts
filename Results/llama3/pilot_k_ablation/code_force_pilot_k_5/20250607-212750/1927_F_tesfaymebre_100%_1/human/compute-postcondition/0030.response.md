The only objects in the loop head are variables  w, u, v and list  edges, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the edges list.  If the list has at least 2 edges the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, edges has at least 1 edge, w, u, and v are assigned new values from the edge in the edges list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 edges and w, u, and v are assigned new values from the next edge in the edges list.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set, and _min_edge is w if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise _min_edge is the previous value of _min_edge. Similarly, start is u if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise start is the previous value of start, and end is v if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise end is the previous value of end. Finally, w, u, and v are assigned new values from the next edge in the edges list.**
