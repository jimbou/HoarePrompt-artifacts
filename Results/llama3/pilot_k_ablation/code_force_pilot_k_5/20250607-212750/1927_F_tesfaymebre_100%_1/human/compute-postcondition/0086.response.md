The only variable in the loop head is variable  nei, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nei`. If `nei` is not the last element in the list `graph[node]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nei` is the first element in the list `graph[node]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `nei` is the second element in the list `graph[node]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is a key in the dictionary `graph` and `nei` is the second element in the list `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 1 element, and `prev[nei]` is `node`.**
