Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` mapped to `-1`, and if the current value of `node` is equal to `end`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+1` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least one more element, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` is a deque containing `start+1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+2` elements, `nei` is `nei_next`, the value of `nei` is added to the deque `que` and the value of `node` is assigned to `prev[nei]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least two elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` is a deque containing `start+1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+2` elements, `nei` is the second element in `graph[node]`, the value of `nei` is added to the deque `que` and the value of `node` is assigned to `prev[nei]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least three elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` is a deque containing `start+2` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+3` elements, and `nei` is the third element in `graph[node]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least four elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start+2` or `start+3` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+3` or `start+4` elements, and `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `start+3` elements and `prev` contains `start+4` elements. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
