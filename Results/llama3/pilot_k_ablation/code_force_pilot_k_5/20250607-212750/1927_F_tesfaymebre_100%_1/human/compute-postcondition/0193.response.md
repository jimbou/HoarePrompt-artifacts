The only objects in the loop head are variables  nei and graph[node], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[node].  If the graph[node] has at least 4 neighbors the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[node] has at least 3 neighbors, nei is the third neighbor of the node. So for the loop to be executed one more time the graph[node] must have at least 4 neighbors and the nei is the fourth neighbor of the node.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 4 keys that must have at least 4 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the fourth neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `que` contains `nei`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
