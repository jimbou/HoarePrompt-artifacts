The only objects in the loop head are variables  nei and graph[node], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[node].  If the list has at least 3 neighbors the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[node] has at least 2 neighbors, nei is the second neighbor of the node. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 neighbors and the nei is the third neighbor of the node.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 3 keys that must have at least 3 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the third neighbor of the node.**
