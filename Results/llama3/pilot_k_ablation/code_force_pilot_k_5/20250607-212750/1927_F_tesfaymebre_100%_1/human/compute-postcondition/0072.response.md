Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least four elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing start+3 elements, prev is a dictionary with start+4 elements, and nei is the fourth element in graph[node].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged. The `que` deque now contains `start+3` elements, as a new element `nei` has been appended to it. The `prev` dictionary now has `start+4` elements, as a new key-value pair `{nei: node}` has been added to it. The value of `nei` is still the fourth element in `graph[node]`.
