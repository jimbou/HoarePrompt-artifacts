The only variable in the loop head is variable curr, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable curr.  If curr is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, curr is the value of prev[curr] and prev[curr] is not equal to -1, So for the loop to be executed one more time the value of prev[curr] must not be -1.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr] and prev[curr] is not equal to -1 and the value of prev[curr] must not be -1**
