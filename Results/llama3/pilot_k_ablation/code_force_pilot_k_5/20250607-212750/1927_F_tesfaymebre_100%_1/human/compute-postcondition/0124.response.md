Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 3 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 1 element, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the third element in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m+1` elements. Otherwise, no changes are made and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have skipped to the next iteration of the loop.
