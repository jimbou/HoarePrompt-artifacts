Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] has at least 2 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que contains at least 1 element, prev is a dictionary with m+1 elements, node is the first element that was in que, nei is the second element in graph[node].**

The code snippet modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. This increases the number of elements in `prev` to `m+1`. Additionally, the `que` list is appended with the value of `nei`, increasing the number of elements in `que` by at least 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
