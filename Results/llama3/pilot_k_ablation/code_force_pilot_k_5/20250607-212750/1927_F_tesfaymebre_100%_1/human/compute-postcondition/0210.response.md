Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr and the value of prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[prev[curr]].**

The code appends the current value of `curr` to the `path` list and then updates `curr` to be the value of `prev[curr]`. This means that `path` now contains two elements: the original value of `curr` and the value of `prev[curr]`. The value of `curr` is then updated to be the value of `prev[prev[curr]]`, which is a new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
