The only variables in the loop head are variables  `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least 1 element, `nei` is the first element in `graph[node]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `graph[node]` must have at least 2 elements and the `nei` is the second element in `graph[node]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 2 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` or `m+1` elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the second element in `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m+1` elements. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
