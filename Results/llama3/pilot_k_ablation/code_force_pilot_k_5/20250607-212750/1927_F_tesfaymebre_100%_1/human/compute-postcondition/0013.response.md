According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the edges. If the list has at least 1 edge the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 edge and the edge is the first edge in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, (w, u, v) is the first edge in the list**
