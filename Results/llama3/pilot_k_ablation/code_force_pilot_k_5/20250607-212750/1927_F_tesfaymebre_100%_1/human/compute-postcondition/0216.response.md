Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr] and prev[curr] is not equal to -1 and the value of prev[curr] must not be -1**

The code snippet modifies the `path` list by appending the current value of `curr` to it. Since `curr` is the value of `prev[curr]`, this means that the list `path` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `prev[curr]`. The value of `curr` is then updated to be the value of `prev[curr]`, effectively moving `curr` one step backward in the path. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
