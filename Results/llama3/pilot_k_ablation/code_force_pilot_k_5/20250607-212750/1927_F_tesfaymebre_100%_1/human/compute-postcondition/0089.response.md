Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] is not empty and has at least 2 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is a deque containing at least 1 element, prev is a dictionary with m elements, prev[nei] is node, and node is a key in the dictionary graph and nei is the second element in the list graph[node].**

In this output state, the code has modified the `prev` dictionary by assigning the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`, and the `que` deque by appending `nei` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `prev` dictionary now contains an additional key-value pair, where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. The `que` deque now contains at least one element, which is `nei`. The other variables, such as `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, and `node`, retain their original values.
