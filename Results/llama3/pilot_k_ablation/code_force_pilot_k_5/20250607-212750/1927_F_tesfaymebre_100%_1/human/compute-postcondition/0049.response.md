Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` mapped to `-1`, `node` is equal to `start`, `nei` is equal to `end`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and we simply skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
