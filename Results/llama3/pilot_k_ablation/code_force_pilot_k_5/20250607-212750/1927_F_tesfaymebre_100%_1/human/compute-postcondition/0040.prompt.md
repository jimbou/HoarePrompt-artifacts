Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing m tuples (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3(), dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        _min_edge = w
        start = u
        end = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, _min_edge remains positive infinity, start remains -1, and end remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu, _min_edge is w if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise _min_edge is positive infinity, start is u if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise start is -1, end is v if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise end is -1. If parent_u is equal to parent_v, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, the parents of u and v in the dsu are now the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set, and _min_edge is w if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise _min_edge is the previous value of _min_edge. Similarly, start is u if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise start is the previous value of start, and end is v if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise end is the previous value of end. Finally, w, u, and v are assigned new values from the next edge in the edges list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the dsu are the same, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu, and _min_edge, start, and end are either updated or remain the same as their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the dsu are the same, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu, and _min_edge, start, and end are either updated or remain the same as their previous values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
