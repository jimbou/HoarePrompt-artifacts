Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the dsu are the same, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu, and _min_edge, start, and end are either updated or remain the same as their previous values.**

The code snippet assigns the parent of `u` and the parent of `v` in the `dsu` to `parent_u` and `parent_v`, respectively. This does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, or the `dsu` instance itself. The values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but their values depend on the parents of `u` and `v` in the `dsu`. If the parents are the same, the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged; otherwise, they may be updated.
