Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is a key in the dictionary `graph` and `nei` is the second element in the list `graph[node]`. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the current iteration of the loop is skipped due to the `continue` statement. This means that the program will move on to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further code in the current iteration.
