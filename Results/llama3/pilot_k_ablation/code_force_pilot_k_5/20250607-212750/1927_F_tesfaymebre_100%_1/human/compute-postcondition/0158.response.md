Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, prev is a dictionary with m+1 elements where the value of nei is now node, que has one more element than before if nei is not in prev and node is not equal to start or nei is not equal to end, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. Additionally, it appends `nei` to the `que` list, increasing its size by one, but only if `nei` is not already in `prev` and `node` is not equal to `start` or `nei` is not equal to `end`. If these conditions are not met, the state of `que` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
