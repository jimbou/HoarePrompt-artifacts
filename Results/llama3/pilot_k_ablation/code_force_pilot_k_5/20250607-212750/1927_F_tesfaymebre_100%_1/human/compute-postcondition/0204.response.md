Output State: `que` is empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is `end`, and `nei` is the last neighbor in the list.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue (`que`) is empty, indicating that all nodes have been processed. The `prev` dictionary contains `m` elements, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is the previous node in the path. The `node` variable is set to `end`, indicating that the loop has reached the end node. The `nei` variable is set to the last neighbor in the list, indicating that all neighbors of the end node have been processed.
