Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 1 element, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` or `m+1` elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the first element in `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m+1` elements. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 2 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 1 element, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the second element in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m+1` elements. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 3 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 1 element, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the third element in `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` has `m+1` elements and `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 4 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 2 elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. If `nei` is in `prev`, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 5 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 3 elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the fifth element in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. If `nei` is in `prev`, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
