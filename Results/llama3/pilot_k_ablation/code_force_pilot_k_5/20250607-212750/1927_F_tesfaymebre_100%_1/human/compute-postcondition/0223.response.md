Functionality: **This function constructs a graph from a set of edges, finds the minimum edge in the graph, and then finds the shortest path between the two nodes connected by the minimum edge. It prints the weight of the minimum edge and the length of the shortest path, followed by the nodes in the shortest path in reverse order.**
