Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `nei` is the next neighbor in the list of `graph[node]`, `que` has one more element than before if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code snippet `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and continues to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged, but we move on to the next iteration.
