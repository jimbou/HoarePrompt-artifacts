You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, and the function func_3() returns a tuple of two positive integers, and the function DSU() is a class that implements the disjoint-set data structure.
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to m, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a list containing m tuples (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3(), and the function DSU() remains unchanged.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    start = -1
    end = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            _min_edge = w
            start = u
            end = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the dsu are the same, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu, and _min_edge, start, and end are either updated or remain the same as their previous values.
    que = deque([start])
    prev = {start: -1}

            if node == start and nei == end:

    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue is empty, and the `prev` dictionary contains all the nodes in the graph as keys, with their corresponding previous nodes as values. The `node` variable is set to the `end` node, and the `nei` variable is set to the last neighbor of the `end` node. The other variables remain unchanged.
    path = []
    curr = end

        path.append(curr)
        
        curr = prev[curr]
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing all the values of curr from the start to the end of the loop, and curr is -1.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the path list contains all the values of curr from the start to the end of the loop, and curr is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables remain unchanged.
    print(_min_edge, len(path))
    #This is printed: the minimum edge and the length of the path (where the minimum edge is the minimum edge in the graph and the length of the path is the number of nodes in the path)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: the elements of the path list in reverse order, starting from -1

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
