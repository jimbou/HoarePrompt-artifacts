Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 3 keys that must have at least 3 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the third neighbor of the node, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values and properties.
