Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que has one more element than before, prev is a dictionary with m+1 elements, the current value of node is the second last element that was in que and is not equal to end, and the current value of nei is the first neighbor in the list and is in the prev dictionary with a value of node.**

The code snippet modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair, where the key is the current value of `nei` and the value is the current value of `node`. This increases the number of elements in the `prev` dictionary by 1. Additionally, the code appends the current value of `nei` to the `que` list, increasing its length by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
