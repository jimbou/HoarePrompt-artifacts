Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty and has one less element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the second last element that was in `que`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the control flow of the program by exiting the current loop or if statement.
