Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has either one less element than before or one more element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with either `m` elements or `m+1` elements, the current value of `node` is the second last element that was in `que` and is not equal to `end`, and the current value of `nei` is the first neighbor in the list. If the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is added to `prev` with a value of `node` and `que` has one more element than before. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.***
