Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is `end`, and `nei` is the last neighbor in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue `que` is empty, indicating that all nodes have been visited. The `prev` dictionary has been updated to keep track of the previous node for each node in the graph. The `node` variable is now equal to `end`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `nei` variable is the last neighbor in the list, indicating that all neighbors have been visited. The other variables remain unchanged.
