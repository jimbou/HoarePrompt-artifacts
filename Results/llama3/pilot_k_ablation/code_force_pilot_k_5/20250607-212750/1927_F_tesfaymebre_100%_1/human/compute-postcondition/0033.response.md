Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input and `u` and `v` are now in the same set, `parent_u` is either the parent of `u` in the `dsu` or `v`, `parent_v` is either the parent of `v` in the `dsu` or `u`, `_min_edge` is either `w` or the previous value of `_min_edge`, `start` is either `u` or the previous value of `start`, and `end` is either `v` or the previous value of `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. The `dsu` instance now has `u` and `v` in the same set, and the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` is either `u` or `v`.
