Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing the value of curr, the value of prev[curr], and the original values of curr and prev[curr], and curr is the value of prev[curr].**

The code modifies the state of the variables `path` and `curr`. The first line appends the value of `curr` to the list `path`, which originally contained the value of `curr` and the value of `prev[curr]`. The second line assigns the value of `prev[curr]` to `curr`. No other variables are affected.
