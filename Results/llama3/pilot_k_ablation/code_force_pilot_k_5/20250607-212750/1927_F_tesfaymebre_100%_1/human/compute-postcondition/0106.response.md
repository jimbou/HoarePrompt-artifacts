Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing at least `m-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least `m-1` elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, the state of `que` and `prev` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue (`que`) contains at least `m-1` elements, and the `prev` dictionary has `m` elements, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is the previous node in the graph. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
