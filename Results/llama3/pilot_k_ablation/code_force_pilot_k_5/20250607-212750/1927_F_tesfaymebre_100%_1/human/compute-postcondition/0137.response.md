Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 5 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then no changes are made. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 3 elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the fifth element in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. If `nei` is in `prev`, then no changes are made.***
