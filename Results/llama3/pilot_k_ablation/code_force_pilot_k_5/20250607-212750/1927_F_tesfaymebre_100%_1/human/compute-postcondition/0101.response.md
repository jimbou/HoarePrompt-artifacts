The only objects in the loop head are variables  `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[node]`.  If the `graph[node]` has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least 4 elements, `nei` is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `graph[node]` must have at least 5 elements and the `nei` is the fifth element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least 5 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains at least 2 elements and `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements, where `prev[nei]` is `node`. Otherwise, `que` contains at least 1 element and `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
