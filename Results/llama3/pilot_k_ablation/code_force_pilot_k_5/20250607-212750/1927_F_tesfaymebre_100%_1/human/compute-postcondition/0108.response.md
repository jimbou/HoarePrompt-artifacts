Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least `m-1` elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 0 elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is the first element that was in `que`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged. The queue `que` has been dequeued, so it now contains at least 0 elements. The dictionary `prev` remains unchanged. A new variable `node` has been introduced, which is assigned the value of the first element that was in `que`.
