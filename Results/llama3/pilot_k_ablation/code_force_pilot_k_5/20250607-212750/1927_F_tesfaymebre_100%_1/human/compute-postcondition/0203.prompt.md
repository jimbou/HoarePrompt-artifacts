Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `node` is equal to `end`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise its size is reduced by 1, `prev` has increased in size by 1 if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise it remains the same, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the first neighbor of the node and is now in `prev` if `nei` is not in `prev`, and if the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`, then the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is moved to.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the second neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has increased in size by 1 and `prev` has increased in size by 1, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. Otherwise, the size of `que` is reduced by 1 and the size of `prev` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 3 keys that must have at least 3 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the third neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `que` contains `nei`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 4 keys that must have at least 4 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the fourth neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `que` contains `nei`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 5 keys that must have at least 5 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the fifth neighbor of the node. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`, and `que` contains `nei`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
