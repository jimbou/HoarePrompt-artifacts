Output State: **`test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()` that must be greater than 1 and `func_6()` has been executed twice.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as it was already assigned a value returned by `func_1()` that is greater than 1. The execution of `func_6()` does not affect the value of `test_cases`. However, since `func_6()` has been executed again, the output state now reflects that `func_6()` has been executed twice.
