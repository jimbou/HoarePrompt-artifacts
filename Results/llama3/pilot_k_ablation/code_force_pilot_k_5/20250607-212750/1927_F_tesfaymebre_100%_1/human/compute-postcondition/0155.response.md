To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `nei`, `graph`, and `node`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more neighbors in the `graph[node]` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node.

For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor. Let's assume the current neighbor is `nei`. For the loop to execute again, `nei` must be the next neighbor in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `nei` is the next neighbor in the list of `graph[node]`, `que` has one more element than before if `nei` is not in `prev`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements.**
