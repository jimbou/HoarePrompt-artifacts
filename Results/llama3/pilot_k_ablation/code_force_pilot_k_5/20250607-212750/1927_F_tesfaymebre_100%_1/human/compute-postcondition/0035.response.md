The only objects in the loop head are variables  w, u, v and list  edges, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the edges.  If the list has at least 2 edges the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, edges has at least 1 edge, (w, u, v) is the first edge in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 edges and (w, u, v) is the second edge in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the dsu are the same, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu, and _min_edge, start, and end are either updated or remain the same as their previous values.**
