Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] has at least 1 element, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que contains at least 1 element, prev is a dictionary with m+1 elements, node is the first element that was in que, nei is the first element in graph[node].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged. The `que` now contains at least 1 element, which is the value of `nei`. The `prev` dictionary now has `m+1` elements, with the key-value pair `{nei: node}` added to it. The values of `node` and `nei` are updated to the first element that was in `que` and the first element in `graph[node]`, respectively.
