Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start-1` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` mapped to `-1`, and `node` is `start`.**

In this output state, the value of `node` is assigned the value of `start` which was the only element in the deque `que`. The deque `que` is now empty except for `start-1` elements. The values of the other variables are not affected.
