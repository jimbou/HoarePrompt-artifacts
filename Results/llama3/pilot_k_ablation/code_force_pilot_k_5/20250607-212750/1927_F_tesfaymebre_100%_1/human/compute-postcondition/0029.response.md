Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input. If the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set, and _min_edge is w if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise _min_edge is the previous value of _min_edge. Similarly, start is u if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise start is the previous value of start, and end is v if w is less than the previous value of _min_edge, otherwise end is the previous value of end. Finally, w, u, and v are assigned new values from the next edge in the edges list.***
