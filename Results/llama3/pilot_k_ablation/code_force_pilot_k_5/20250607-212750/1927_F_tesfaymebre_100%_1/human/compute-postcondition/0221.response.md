The code prints the elements of the path list in reverse order. The path list contains all the values of curr from the start to the end of the loop. Since curr is -1, the path list contains -1 as its last element. The length of the path list is not explicitly printed, but it can be inferred as the number of elements in the path list.

Output: **the elements of the path list in reverse order, starting from -1**
