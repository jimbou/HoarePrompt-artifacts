Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `nei` is the next neighbor in the list of `graph[node]`, `que` has one more element than before if `nei` is not in `prev` and `node` is not equal to `start` or `nei` is not equal to `end`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements.***
