Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least four elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start+2` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+3` elements, and `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, as the `continue` statement only skips to the next iteration of the loop without changing any variable values.
