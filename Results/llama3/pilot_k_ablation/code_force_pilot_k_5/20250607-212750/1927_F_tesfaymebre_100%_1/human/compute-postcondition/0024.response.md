Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 edges, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu, _min_edge is w if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise _min_edge is positive infinity, start is u if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise start is -1, end is v if the parent of u in the dsu is equal to the parent of v in the dsu, otherwise end is -1. If parent_u is equal to parent_v, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, the parents of u and v in the dsu are now the same.**
