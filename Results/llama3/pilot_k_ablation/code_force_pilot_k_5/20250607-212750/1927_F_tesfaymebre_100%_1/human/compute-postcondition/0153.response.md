Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has one more element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with `m+1` elements.**

The code modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. Additionally, it appends `nei` to the `que` list, increasing its size by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
