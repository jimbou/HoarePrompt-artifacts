To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nei` is the third element in `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must have at least four elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least four elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start+2` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+3` elements, and `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`.**
