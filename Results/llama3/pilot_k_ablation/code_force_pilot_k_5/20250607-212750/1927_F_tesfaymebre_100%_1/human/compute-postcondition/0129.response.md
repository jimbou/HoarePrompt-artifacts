Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` has at least 4 elements, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` contains at least 1 element, `node` is the first element that was in `que`, `nei` is the fourth element in `graph[node]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
