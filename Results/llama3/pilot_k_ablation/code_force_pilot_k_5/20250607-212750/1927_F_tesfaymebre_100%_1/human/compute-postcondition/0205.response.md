Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least `m` keys that must have at least `m` neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is `end`, and `nei` is the last neighbor in the list.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue is empty, and the `prev` dictionary contains all the nodes in the graph as keys, with their corresponding previous nodes as values. The `node` variable is set to the `end` node, and the `nei` variable is set to the last neighbor of the `end` node. The other variables remain unchanged.
