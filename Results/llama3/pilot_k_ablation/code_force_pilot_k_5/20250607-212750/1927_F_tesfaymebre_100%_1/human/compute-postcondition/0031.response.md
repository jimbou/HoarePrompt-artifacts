Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu, _min_edge is either w or the previous value of _min_edge, start is either u or the previous value of start, and end is either v or the previous value of end.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` to `parent_u` and `parent_v`, respectively. These assignments do not modify any of the initial state variables, but rather introduce two new variables, `parent_u` and `parent_v`, which hold the parent values of `u` and `v` in the `dsu`. The remaining variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
