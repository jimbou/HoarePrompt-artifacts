Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the second neighbor of the node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has increased in size by 1 and `prev` has increased in size by 1, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. Otherwise, the size of `que` is reduced by 1 and the size of `prev` remains the same.***
