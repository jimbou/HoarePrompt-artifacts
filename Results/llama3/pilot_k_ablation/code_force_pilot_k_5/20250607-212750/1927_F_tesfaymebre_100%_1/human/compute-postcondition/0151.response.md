Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 1 neighbor for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` has either one less element than before or one more element than before, `prev` is a dictionary with either `m` elements or `m+1` elements, the current value of `node` is the second last element that was in `que` and is not equal to `end`, and the current value of `nei` is the second neighbor in the list, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration, due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
