To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`. This means we can only adjust the states of `nei` and `graph[node]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `graph[node]` is not empty, and `nei` is one of the elements in `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must still have at least one more element, and `nei` must be the next element in `graph[node]`.

Since `graph[node]` is a list with `m-1` keys, and `i` is `m-1`, we know that `graph[node]` has at least one more element. Let's assume the next element in `graph[node]` is `nei_next`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with `m-1` keys, `graph[node]` is not empty and has at least one more element, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is a deque containing `start` elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start+1` elements, `nei` is `nei_next`**
