According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node` and `graph`. If `graph` has at least 1 key and `node` is a key in the graph, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements. If `node` is equal to `end`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. So for the loop to be executed  the graph must have at least 1 key and the node is a key in the graph and nei is the first neighbor of the node.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 2 keys that must have at least 2 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `que` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `prev` is a dictionary with `m` elements, `node` is a key in the graph, nei is the first neighbor of the node**
