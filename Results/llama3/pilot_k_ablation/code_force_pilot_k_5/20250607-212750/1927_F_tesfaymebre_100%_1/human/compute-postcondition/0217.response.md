Output State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with at least m keys that must have at least m neighbors for the node, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que is empty, prev is a dictionary with m elements, node is end, and nei is the last neighbor in the list, path is a list containing all the values of curr, and curr is -1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the path list contains all the values of curr, and curr is -1. This means that the loop has traversed all the nodes in the graph and has reached the end node, which is represented by -1. The other variables remain unchanged, indicating that the loop has not affected their values.
