Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` keys that must have at least 1 key, each containing a list with at least 5 keys that must have at least 5 neighbors for the node, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n+1` as the input, `node` is a key in the graph, `nei` is the fifth neighbor of the node. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `que` contains `nei`.***
