Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to n, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with m keys, each containing a list with m-1 keys, graph[node] has at least 3 elements, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n+1 as the input, que contains at least 2 elements, node is the first element that was in que, nei is the third element in graph[node], prev has m+1 elements, and prev[nei] is node.**

In this output state, the code has added a new element to the `que` list, which now contains at least 2 elements. The `prev` dictionary has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. The `nei` variable is still the third element in the list `graph[node]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
