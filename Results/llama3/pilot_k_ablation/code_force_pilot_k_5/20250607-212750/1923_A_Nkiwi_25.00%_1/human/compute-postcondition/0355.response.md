The only variables in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the idx and arrs. If idx is less than len(arrs), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is 3, arrs has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again idx must be 4 and arrs must have at least 5 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt1` is 4 if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1 and the third element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 3, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines**
