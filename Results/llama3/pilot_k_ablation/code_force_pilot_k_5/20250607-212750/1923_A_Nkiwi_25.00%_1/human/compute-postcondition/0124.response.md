Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is now 2; otherwise, `cnt1` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
