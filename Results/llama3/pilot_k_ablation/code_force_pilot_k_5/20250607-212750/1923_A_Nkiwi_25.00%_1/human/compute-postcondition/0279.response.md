Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is either 3, 4 or 2, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements minus one if the first two elements of `arrs` are 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, then `cnt1` is either 4 or 3, otherwise `cnt1` is either 3 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 4 or 3, otherwise `cnt1` is either 3 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, and its possible values have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the first two elements of `arrs` and `arrs[idx]` still apply to `cnt1`.
