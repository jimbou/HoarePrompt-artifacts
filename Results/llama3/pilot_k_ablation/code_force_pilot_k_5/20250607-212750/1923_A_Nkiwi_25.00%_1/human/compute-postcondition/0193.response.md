Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 0, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt1` is reset to 0. The values of other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The number of lines in `stdin` is also unchanged.
