Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `idx` will be equal to the last index of the list `arrs`, `cnt1` will be equal to the total number of ones in the list `arrs`, and `ans` will be either 0 if there is at most one 1 in `arrs`, or the total number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the total number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if there are more than one 1s in `arrs`. The values of `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
