Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt1` is 2 if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the second element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.***
