Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 0 or 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**
