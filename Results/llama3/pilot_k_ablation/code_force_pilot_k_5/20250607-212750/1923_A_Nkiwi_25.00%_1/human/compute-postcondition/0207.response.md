The only variable in the loop head is variable  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable idx and arrs. If idx is less than len(arrs), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is 3, arrs has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again idx must be 4 and arrs must have at least 5 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 1, `cnt1` is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4 and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**
