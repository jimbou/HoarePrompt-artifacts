Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `length`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The value of `idx` will be the last index of the list `arrs`, which is `len(arrs)-1`. The value of `cnt1` will be the total number of ones in the list `arrs`. The value of `cnt0` will depend on the first element of `arrs`: if it is 0, `cnt0` will be the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one; if it is 1, `cnt0` will be the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element.
