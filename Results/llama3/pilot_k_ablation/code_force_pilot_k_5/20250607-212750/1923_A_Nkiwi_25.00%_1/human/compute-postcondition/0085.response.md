The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt0` is 0, so the value of `cnt0` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The current value of the element at index `idx` of `arrs` is still 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `arrs` is 1, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines, and the current value of the element at index `idx` of `arrs` is 0.**
