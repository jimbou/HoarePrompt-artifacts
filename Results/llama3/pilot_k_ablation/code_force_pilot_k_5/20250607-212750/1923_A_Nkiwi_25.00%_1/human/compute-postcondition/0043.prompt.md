Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, cnt0 is 0, stdin contains at least t-2 lines
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `cnt0` is not changed. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0, then if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+1` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is two more than its initial value and `cnt0` is one more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+2` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is two more than its initial value and `cnt0` is two more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is one more than its previous value and `idx` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `idx` is one more than its previous value if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `idx` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `idx` remains unchanged, `cnt0` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is one more than its initial value

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+3` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is three more than its initial value and `cnt0` is three more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is two more than its previous value and `idx` is two more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `idx` is two more than its previous value if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `idx` is three more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `idx` remains unchanged, `cnt0` is three more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is two more than its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+4` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is four more than its initial value and `cnt0` is four more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is three more than its previous value and `idx` is three more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `idx` is three more than its previous value if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `idx` is four more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `idx` remains unchanged, `cnt0` is four more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` is three more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is one more than its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
