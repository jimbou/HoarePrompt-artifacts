Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements minus one if the first two elements of `arrs` are 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been updated to be either 5 or 4, because it was incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
