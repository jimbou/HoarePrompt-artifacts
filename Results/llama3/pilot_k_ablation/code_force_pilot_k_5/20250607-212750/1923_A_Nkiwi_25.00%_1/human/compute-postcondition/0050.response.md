Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `idx` is 1, and `cnt1` is 2 if the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, then `cnt1` becomes 2, otherwise it remains 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
