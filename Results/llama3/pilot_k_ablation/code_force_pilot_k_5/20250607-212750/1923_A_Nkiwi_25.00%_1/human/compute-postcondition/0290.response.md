Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.
