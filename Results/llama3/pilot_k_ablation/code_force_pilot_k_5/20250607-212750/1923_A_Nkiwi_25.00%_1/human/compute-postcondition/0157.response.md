Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, and `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is 1***
