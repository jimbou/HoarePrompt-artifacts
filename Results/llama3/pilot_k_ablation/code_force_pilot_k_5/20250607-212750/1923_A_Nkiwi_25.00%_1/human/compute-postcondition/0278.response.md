The only variables in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `idx` and `arrs`. If `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, `arrs` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be increased by 1, so `idx` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `arrs` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is either 2, 3 or 1, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements minus one if the first two elements of `arrs` are 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, then `cnt1` is either 3 or 2, otherwise `cnt1` is either 2 or 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 3 or 2, otherwise `cnt1` is either 2 or 1.**
