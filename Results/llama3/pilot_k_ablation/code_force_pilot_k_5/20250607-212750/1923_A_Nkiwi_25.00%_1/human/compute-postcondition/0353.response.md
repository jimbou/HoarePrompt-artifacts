Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is 4 if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1 and the third element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 3, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1. If the first two elements of `arrs` are 1 and the third element is 1, then `cnt1` is now 4; otherwise, `cnt1` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still being printed, and the stdin still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.
