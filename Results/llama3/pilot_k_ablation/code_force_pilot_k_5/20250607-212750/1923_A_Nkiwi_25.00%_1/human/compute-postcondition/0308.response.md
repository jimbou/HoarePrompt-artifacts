Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 1, the first element of `arrs` is 1, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still has at least one element, and its first element is still 1. The value of `ans` is still the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. The number of lines in `stdin` is still at least `t-len(arrs)-3`.
