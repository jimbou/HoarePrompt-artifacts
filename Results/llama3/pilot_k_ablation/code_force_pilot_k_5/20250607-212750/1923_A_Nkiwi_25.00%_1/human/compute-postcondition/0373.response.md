Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function takes t, the number of test cases, as input, followed by t blocks of two lines each. Each block contains an integer n, the length of the array, and a space-separated list of n integers (0s and 1s). The function calculates the minimum number of zeros required to separate the ones into a contiguous block, excluding the first element. If there is only one or no ones, the result is 0. Otherwise, the result is the number of zeros in the array, excluding the first element. The function prints the result for each test case and consumes all input from stdin, leaving it empty.**
