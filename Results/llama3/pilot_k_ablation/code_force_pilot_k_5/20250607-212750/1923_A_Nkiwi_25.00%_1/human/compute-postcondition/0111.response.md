The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt0` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `cnt0` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is increased by 1**
