Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt0` and `ans` still depend on the first element of `arrs` and the last element of `arrs` respectively. The value of `ans` is still being printed. The number of lines in `stdin` remains at least `t-len(arrs)-3`.
