To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `idx` and the list `arrs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `idx` and the length of `arrs`. If `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 0, and `arrs` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 1. Additionally, `arrs` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `length`, `stdin`, and `cnt1` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `idx` is 1, and `cnt1` is 1 if the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` remains 0**
