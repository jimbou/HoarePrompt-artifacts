According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `idx` and `arrs`. If `arrs` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, which means `idx` is the last index of `arrs`. So for the loop to be executed, `idx` must be 0 and `arrs` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines**
