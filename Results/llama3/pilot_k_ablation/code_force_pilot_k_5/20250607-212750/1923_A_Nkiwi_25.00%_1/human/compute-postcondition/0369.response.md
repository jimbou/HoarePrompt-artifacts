Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then if the last element of `arrs` is 0, the value of `ans` is not being printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is not being printed. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0, then the value of `ans` is not being printed. If `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element.***
