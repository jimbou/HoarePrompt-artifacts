Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first element being 0, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed. Otherwise, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed.***
