Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is not 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is 0. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0.***
