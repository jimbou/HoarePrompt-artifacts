Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element, cnt1 is the number of ones in arrs, ans is either 0 if cnt1 is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if cnt1 is larger than 1, and stdin contains 0 lines.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t is greater than or equal to 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is equal to the length of arrs minus 1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element, cnt1 is the number of ones in arrs, ans is either 0 if cnt1 is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if cnt1 is larger than 1, and stdin contains 0 lines.
