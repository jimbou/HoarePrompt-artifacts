To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`. At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 3, and `arrs` has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `arrs` must have at least 5 elements.

The other variables, `t`, `length`, `stdin`, and `cnt1`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-4 lines, `idx` is 4. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, then `cnt1` is 5. Otherwise, `cnt1` is 4.**
