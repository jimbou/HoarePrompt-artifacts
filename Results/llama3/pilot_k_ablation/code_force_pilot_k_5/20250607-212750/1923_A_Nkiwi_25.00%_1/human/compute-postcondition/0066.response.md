Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least len(arrs) elements, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs) lines, idx is len(arrs)-1, and cnt1 is equal to the number of 1s in arrs. If the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, cnt0 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
