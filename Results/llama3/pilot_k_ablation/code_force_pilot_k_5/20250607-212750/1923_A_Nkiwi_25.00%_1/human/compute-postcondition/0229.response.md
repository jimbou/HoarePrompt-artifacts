Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The first element of `arrs` is 0. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is still 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is still 0. The number of lines in `stdin` is still at least `t-len(arrs)-3`.
