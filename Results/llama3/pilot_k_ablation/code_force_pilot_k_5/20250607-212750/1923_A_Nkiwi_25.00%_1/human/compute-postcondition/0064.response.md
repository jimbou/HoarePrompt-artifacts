Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)` lines, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1s in `arrs`, `cnt0` is decreased by 1, the first element of `arrs` is 0, and the current value of the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still has at least `len(arrs)` elements, and its first and last elements are still 0. The number of 1s in `arrs` is still tracked by `cnt1`. The input buffer `stdin` still contains at least `t-len(arrs)` lines. The index `idx` is still at the last position of `arrs`.
