Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least len(arrs) elements, cnt1 is 0, stdin contains at least t-2 lines. If arrs[0] is 0, then cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element. If arrs[0] is 1, then cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[idx] == 1:
        cnt1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains at least t-2 lines, idx is 0, and cnt1 is 1 if the current value of arrs at index idx is 1, otherwise cnt1 remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `idx` is 1, and `cnt1` is 2 if the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-3 lines, `idx` is 2. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, then `cnt1` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt1` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-4 lines, `idx` is 3. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, then `cnt1` is 5. Otherwise, `cnt1` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-4 lines, `idx` is 4. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, then `cnt1` is 6. Otherwise, `cnt1` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
