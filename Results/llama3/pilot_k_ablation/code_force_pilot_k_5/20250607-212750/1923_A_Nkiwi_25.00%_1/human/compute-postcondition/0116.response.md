Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1 if the element at index 4 of `arrs` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then the element at index 4 of `arrs` is checked and `cnt0` is increased by 1 if it is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
