Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if arrs[0] is 0, or the number of zeros in arrs if arrs[0] is 1, cnt1 is the number of 1's in arrs, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-2 lines.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 1, `length` remains an integer, `arrs` remains a list of integers, `idx` is now equal to the last index of `arrs`, `cnt0` remains the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is now equal to the total number of 1's in `arrs`, and `stdin` still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.
