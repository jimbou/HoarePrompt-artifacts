Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `cnt0` is not changed. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0, then if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0.***
