Output State: **t is an integer equal to the input value, stdin contains 2t lines.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), `t` becomes this integer value. The second line is a multi-line comment and does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
