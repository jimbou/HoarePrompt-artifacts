Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+1` elements, `idx` is one more than its previous value, `cnt0` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, and the value of `idx` is still one more than its previous value. The values of `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and the number of lines in `stdin` remain unchanged.
