Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines, and either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0.***
