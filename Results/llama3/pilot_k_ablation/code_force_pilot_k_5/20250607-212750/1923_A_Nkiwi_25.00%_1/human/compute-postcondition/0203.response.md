Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 1, `cnt1` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 1, 2 or 3 and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.***
