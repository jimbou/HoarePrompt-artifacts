Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is still 1.
