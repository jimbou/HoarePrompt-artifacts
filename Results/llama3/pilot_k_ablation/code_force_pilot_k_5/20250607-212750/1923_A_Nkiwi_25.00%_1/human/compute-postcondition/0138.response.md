Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus one, cnt1 is the number of 1's in arrs, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-2 lines. The first element of arrs is 0. The current value of the last element of arrs is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of cnt0 has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list arrs still has the same elements, with the first element being 0 and the last element being 0. The stdin still contains at least t-len(arrs)-2 lines.
