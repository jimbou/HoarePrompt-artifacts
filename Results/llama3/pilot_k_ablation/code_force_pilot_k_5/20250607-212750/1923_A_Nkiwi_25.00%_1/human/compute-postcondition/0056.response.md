Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-4 lines, `idx` is 3. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, then `cnt1` is 5. Otherwise, `cnt1` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` (which is 3) is 1, then `cnt1` is now 5. Otherwise, `cnt1` is now 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
