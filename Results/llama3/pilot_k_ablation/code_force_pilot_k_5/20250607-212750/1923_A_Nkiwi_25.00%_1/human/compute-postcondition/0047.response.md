The code increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. The initial value of `cnt1` is 0, so the new value of `cnt1` is 1. The other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt1` is 1, `idx` is 0, stdin contains at least t-2 lines, and the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1.**
