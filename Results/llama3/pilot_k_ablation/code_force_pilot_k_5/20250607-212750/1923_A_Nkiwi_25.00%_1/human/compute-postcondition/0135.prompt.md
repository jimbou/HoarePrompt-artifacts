Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if arrs[0] is 0, or the number of zeros in arrs if arrs[0] is 1, cnt1 is 0, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-2 lines.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[idx] == 1:
        cnt1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 3 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 2, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 4 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 3, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 5 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 4, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
