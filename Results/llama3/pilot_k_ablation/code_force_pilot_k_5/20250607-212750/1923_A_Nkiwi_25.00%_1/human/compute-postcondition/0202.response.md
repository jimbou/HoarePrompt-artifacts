Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 1, `cnt1` is either 1, 2 or 3, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 1 or 2, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is 3. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 2 or 3 and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `cnt1` and the first element of `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 2, then `ans` is 0. If `cnt1` is 3, then `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
