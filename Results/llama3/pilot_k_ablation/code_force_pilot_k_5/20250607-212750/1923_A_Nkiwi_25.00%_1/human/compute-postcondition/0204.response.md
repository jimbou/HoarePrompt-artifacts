The only variable in the loop head is variable  idx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `idx` and `len(arrs)`. If `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, `len(arrs)` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be increased by 1 and `len(arrs)` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 1, `cnt1` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 1, 2 or 3 and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**
