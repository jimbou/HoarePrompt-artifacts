Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and the first element of `arrs` is 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines, `idx` is not 0. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `cnt0` is not changed.***
