Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 5 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 4, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.***
