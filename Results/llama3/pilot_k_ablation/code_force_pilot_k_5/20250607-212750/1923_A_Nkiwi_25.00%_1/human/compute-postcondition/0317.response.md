Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is either 1 or not equal to 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0.**
