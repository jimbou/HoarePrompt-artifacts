Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `cnt0` is either 3 or 4 if `arrs[0]` is 1, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines if `arrs[0]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1. The value of `cnt0` depends on the values of `arrs[0]` and `idx`. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 3 or 4. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. The values of `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `idx` remain the same. The number of lines in `stdin` also remains the same, but the minimum number of lines required depends on the values of `arrs[0]` and `idx`.
