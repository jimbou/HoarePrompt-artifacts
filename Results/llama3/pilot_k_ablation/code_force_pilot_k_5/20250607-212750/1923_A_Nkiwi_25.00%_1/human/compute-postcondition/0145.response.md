Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, stdin contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1. `cnt1` is larger than 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `cnt0`, which represents the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
