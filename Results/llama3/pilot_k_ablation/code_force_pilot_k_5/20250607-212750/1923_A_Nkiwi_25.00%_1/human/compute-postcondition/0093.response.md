Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines, `cnt0` is either 0 or 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.***
