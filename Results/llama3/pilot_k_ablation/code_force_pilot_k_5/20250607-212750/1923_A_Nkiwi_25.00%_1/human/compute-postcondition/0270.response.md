Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is 1, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 3, `length` remains an integer, `arrs` is still a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is still 0, `cnt1` has been incremented to 1, `cnt0` remains either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is still 1.
