Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt1` is either 2, 3 or 1, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements minus one if the first two elements of `arrs` are 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first two elements of `arrs` are 1, then `cnt1` is either 3 or 2, otherwise `cnt1` is either 2 or 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is either 3 or 2, otherwise `cnt1` is either 2 or 1.***
