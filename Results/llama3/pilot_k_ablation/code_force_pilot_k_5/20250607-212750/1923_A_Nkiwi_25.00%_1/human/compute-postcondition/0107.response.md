Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `cnt0` is either 3 or 4 if `arrs[0]` is 1, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 0 or 1 if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[0]` is 1, or `cnt0` is either 0 or 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 0 or 1 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines if `arrs[0]` is 1.***
