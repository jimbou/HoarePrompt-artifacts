Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+2` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is two more than its initial value and `cnt0` is two more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `idx` is one more than its previous value. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
