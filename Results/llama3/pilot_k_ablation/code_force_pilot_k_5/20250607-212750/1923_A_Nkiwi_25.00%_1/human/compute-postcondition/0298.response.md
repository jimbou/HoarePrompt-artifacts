State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-4` lines. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed**
