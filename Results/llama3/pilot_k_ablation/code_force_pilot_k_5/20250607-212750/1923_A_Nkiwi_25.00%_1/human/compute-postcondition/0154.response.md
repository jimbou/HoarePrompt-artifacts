Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is not equal to 0, `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, and `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. The first element of `arrs` is 0. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt0` is now 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions.
