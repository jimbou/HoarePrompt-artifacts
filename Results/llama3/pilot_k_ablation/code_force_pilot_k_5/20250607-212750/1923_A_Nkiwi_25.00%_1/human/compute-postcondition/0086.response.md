Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `arrs` is 1, `idx` is 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If the current value of the element at index `idx` of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `cnt0` remains unchanged.***
