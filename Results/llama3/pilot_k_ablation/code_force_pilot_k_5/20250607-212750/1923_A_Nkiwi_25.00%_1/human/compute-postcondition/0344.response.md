Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is 1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines, and the current value of the first element of `arrs` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt1` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `arrs`, `idx`, `cnt0`, `ans`, and `stdin` are still valid.
