Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines, and the current value of the first element of `arrs` is 1.**
