Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then if the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains the same. `cnt1` is more than 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `cnt0`, which is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. The other variables remain unchanged.
