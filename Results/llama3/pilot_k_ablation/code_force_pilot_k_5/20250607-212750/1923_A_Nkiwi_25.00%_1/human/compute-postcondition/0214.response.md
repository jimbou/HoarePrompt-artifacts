Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `cnt1` is larger than 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is 0. If the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains the same.***
