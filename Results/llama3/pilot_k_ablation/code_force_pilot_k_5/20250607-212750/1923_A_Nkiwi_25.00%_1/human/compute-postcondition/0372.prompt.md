Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the input value, stdin contains 2t lines.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt0 = 0
    for idx in range(len(arrs)):
        if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        elif arrs[0] == 1:
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
    cnt1 = 0
    for idx in range(len(arrs)):
        if arrs[idx] == 1:
            cnt1 += 1
    if arrs[0] == 0:
        if arrs[len(arrs) - 1] == 0:
            cnt0 -= 1
    ans = 0
    if cnt1 == 1 or cnt1 == 0:
        ans = 0
    else:
        ans = cnt0
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)` lines, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, and if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1. If `cnt1` is either 0 or 1, `cnt1` retains its value and `ans` is 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the answer which is either 0 or cnt0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, and `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1, stdin contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then if the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains the same. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element)

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then if the last element of `arrs` is 0, the value of `ans` is not being printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is not being printed. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0, then the value of `ans` is not being printed. If `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
