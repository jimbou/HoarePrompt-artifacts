Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[idx] == 1:
        cnt1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt1` is 2 if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the second element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt1` is 3 if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1 and the third element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 2, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is 4 if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1 and the third element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 3, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt1` is 5 if the first two elements of `arrs` are 1 and the third element is 1 and the fifth element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 4, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
