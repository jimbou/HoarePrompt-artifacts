Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then `cnt1` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 0.***
