Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is 0, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-2 lines
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is either 0 or not 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, or `arrs[0]` is not 0, then if `arrs[0]` is 1 and the current value of the element at index `idx` of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines, `cnt0` is either 0 or 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is not 0 and not 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 0 or 1 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines if `arrs[0]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1 if the element at index 4 of `arrs` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then the element at index 4 of `arrs` is checked and `cnt0` is increased by 1 if it is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
