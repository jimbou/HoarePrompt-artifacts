Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 3, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is 0, cnt1 is the number of ones in arrs, and stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-3 lines. The first element of arrs is either 0 or 1. If the first element of arrs is 0, then if the last element of arrs is 0, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus one. Otherwise, cnt0 remains the same. If cnt1 is 0 or 1, ans is 0. Otherwise, ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element)
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0 or not 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `idx` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0. If `idx` is 0, then if the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, `cnt0` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is 1. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `arrs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `arrs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 3 or 4. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `arrs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
