The only variable in the loop head is variable  idx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `idx` and `arrs`. If `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is not specified, `arrs` must have at least `idx+1` elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be increased by 1 and `arrs` must have at least `idx+2` elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+2` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is two more than its initial value and `cnt0` is one more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `idx` is one more than its previous value.**
