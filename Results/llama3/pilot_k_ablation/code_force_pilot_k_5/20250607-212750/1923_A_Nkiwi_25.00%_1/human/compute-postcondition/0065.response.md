Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least len(arrs) elements, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs) lines, idx is len(arrs)-1, and cnt1 is equal to the number of 1s in arrs. The first element of arrs is 0. If the last element of arrs is 0, cnt0 is decreased by 1.***
