Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt1` is 3 if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the second element is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 2, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1. If the first two elements of `arrs` are both 1, then `cnt1` is now 3; otherwise, it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
