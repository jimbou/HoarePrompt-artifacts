Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains at least t-3 lines, `idx` is 2, and `cnt1` is 3 if the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `arrs` at index `idx` (which is 2) is 1, then `cnt1` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
