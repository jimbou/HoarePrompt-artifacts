Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is 2 if the first element of `arrs` is 1, or `cnt0` is 2 if the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is now either 2 or 3. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then `cnt0` is now 2. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
