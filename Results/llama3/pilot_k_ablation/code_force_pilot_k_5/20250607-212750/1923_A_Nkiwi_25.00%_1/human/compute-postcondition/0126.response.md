The only variables in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `idx` and `arrs`. If `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1, `arrs` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be increased by 1, so `idx` is 2, and `arrs` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.**
