Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `arrs`.***
