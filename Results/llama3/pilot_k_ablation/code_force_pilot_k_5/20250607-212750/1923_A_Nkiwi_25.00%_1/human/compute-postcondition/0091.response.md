Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, the state of `cnt0` is unchanged.***
