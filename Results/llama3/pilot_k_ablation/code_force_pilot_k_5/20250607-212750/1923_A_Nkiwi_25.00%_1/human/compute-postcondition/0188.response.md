Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is either 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first four elements if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not equal to 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, or 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, or 2 plus the previous value of `cnt0` if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not equal to 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, or 2 plus the previous value of `cnt0` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, or 1 plus the previous value of `cnt0` if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, and `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first four elements if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 2, `length` is still an integer, `arrs` is still a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `idx` is still 4, `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, `cnt1` is still the number of 1's in `arrs`, and `ans` is still either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first four elements if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. The number of lines in `stdin` is still at least `t-len(arrs)-3`.
