Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus two, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The first element of `arrs` is 0. The current value of the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is still 0, and the last element of `arrs` is also 0. The number of ones in `arrs` is still tracked by `cnt1`, and the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element is now tracked by `cnt0` minus two. The input in `stdin` remains unchanged, with at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines still available.
