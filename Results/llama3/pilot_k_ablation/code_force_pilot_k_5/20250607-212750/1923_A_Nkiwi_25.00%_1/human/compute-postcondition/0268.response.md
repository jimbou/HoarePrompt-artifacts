To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`. The loop will execute if `arrs` has at least one element. Since `idx` is initially set to `len(arrs)-1`, we need to adjust it to be within the range of indices for `arrs`. Therefore, `idx` should be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is either the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines**
