Output State: **t is an integer greater than 3, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt0 is 0, cnt1 is the number of ones in arrs, and stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-3 lines. The first element of arrs is either 0 or 1. If the first element of arrs is 0, then if the last element of arrs is 0, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus one. Otherwise, cnt0 remains the same. If cnt1 is 0 or 1, ans is 0. Otherwise, ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element)**
