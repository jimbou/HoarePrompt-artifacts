The only objects in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the idx and arrs.  If the idx is less than the length of arrs the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, idx is either 1 or not equal to 1, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time the idx must be increased by 1 and the length of arrs must be greater than idx.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is either 2 or not equal to 2, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state.**
