Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `cnt0` is either 3 or 4 if `arrs[0]` is 1, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, or `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines if `arrs[0]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 1, `length` is still an integer, `arrs` is still a list of integers with at least 4 elements, and `idx` is still 3. The value of `cnt0` has increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is now either 2 or 3. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is now either 3 or 4. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is now either 1 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is now either 1 or 2. The number of lines in `stdin` remains the same, but the condition for the number of lines in `stdin` has changed depending on the value of `arrs[0]`.
