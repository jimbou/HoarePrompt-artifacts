Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+1` elements, `idx` is two more than its initial value, `cnt0` is one more than its initial value, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1 from its initial value of one more than its current value, resulting in `idx` being two more than its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
