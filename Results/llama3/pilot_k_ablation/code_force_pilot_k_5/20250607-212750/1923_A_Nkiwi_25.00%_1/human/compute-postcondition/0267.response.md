Output State: **t is an integer greater than 3, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs)-1, cnt1 is 0, cnt0 is either the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus one if the first element of arrs is 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 1, and stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-3 lines.**

In this output state, the value of cnt1 has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of cnt0 is still dependent on the first element of arrs, and the stdin still contains at least t-len(arrs)-3 lines.
