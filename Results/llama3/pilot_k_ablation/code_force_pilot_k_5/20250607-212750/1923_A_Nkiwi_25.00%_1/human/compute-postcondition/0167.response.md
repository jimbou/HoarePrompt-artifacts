Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is either 1 or not equal to 0, `cnt0` is either 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not equal to 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, or 1 if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, or 1 plus the previous value of `cnt0` if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not equal to 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, or 1 plus the previous value of `cnt0` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, or remains the same as the previous value of `cnt0` if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, and `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first two elements if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines.***
