Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is either 3 or 4 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 if the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been updated based on the initial conditions. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 3 or 4. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
