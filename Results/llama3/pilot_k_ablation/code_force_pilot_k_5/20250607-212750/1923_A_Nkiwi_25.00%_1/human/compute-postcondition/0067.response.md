Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)` lines, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1s in `arrs`, `ans` is 0, and if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, a new variable `ans` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and their properties are still valid. The state of `cnt0` is updated based on the condition specified in the initial state.
