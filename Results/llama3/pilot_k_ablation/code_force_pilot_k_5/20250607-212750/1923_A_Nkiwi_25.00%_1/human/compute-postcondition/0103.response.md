The only objects in the loop head are variables  idx and list  arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the idx and arrs.  If the idx is less than len(arrs) the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is 2, arrs has at least 3 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time the idx is 3 and arrs must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains either 0 or 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is either 0 or 1.**
