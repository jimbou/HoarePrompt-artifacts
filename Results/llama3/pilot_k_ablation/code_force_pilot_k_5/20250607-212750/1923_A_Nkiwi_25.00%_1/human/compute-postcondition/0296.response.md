Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` depends on the values of `cnt1` and the first and last elements of `arrs`.

If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0.

Otherwise, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. If the last element of `arrs` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, `ans` is `cnt0 - 1`. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `ans` is `cnt0`.

Since the exact values of `cnt1`, `cnt0`, and the elements of `arrs` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the calculated value based on cnt1, cnt0, and the elements of arrs)**
