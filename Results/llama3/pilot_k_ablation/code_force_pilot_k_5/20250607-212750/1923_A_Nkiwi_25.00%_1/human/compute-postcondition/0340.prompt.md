Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 4, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, idx is len(arrs), cnt1 is the number of ones in arrs, cnt0 is 0, ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus one if the last element of arrs is not 0 and the first element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 1, and the value of ans is being printed, stdin contains at least t-len(arrs)-3 lines.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is either 1 or not equal to 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 1 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is either 2 or not equal to 2, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`. `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is updated to 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is either 3 or not equal to 3, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is updated to 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is either 4 or not equal to 4, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is updated to 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
