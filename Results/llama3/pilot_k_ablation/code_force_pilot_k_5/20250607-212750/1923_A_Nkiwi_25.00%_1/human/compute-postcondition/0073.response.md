Based on the precondition, we can determine the value of `ans` as follows:

* If `cnt1` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is 0.
* If `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`.

Since the value of `cnt1` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the possible values of `ans`.

Output: **0 (if cnt1 is 0 or 1), cnt0 (if cnt1 is greater than 1)**
