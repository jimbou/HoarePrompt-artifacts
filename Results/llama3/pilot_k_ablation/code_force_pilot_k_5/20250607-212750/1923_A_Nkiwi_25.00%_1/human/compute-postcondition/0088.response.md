Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is either 0 or not 0, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, or `arrs[0]` is not 0, then if `arrs[0]` is 1 and the current value of the element at index `idx` of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
