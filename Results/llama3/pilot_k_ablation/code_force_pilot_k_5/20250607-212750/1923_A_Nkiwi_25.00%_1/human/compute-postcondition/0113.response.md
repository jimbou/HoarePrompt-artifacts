Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1.
