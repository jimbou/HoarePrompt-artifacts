Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+2` elements, `cnt0` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is one more than its initial value, `idx` is one more than its previous value if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `idx` is two more than its initial value if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `idx` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains at least `t-3` lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` is increased by 1. The values of `t`, `length`, and `arrs` remain unchanged. The value of `idx` may change depending on the values of `arrs[0]` and `idx`. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `idx` is two more than its initial value. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `idx` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, `idx` remains unchanged. The number of lines in `stdin` is decreased by 1.
