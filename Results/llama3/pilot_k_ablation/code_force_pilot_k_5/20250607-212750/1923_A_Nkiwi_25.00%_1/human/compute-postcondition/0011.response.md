Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines, `idx` is 0, and either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0 is still valid, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is still 0.
