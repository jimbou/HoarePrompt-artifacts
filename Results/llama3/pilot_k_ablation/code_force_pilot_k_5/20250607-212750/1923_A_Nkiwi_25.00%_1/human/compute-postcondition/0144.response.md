Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is the number of 1's in `arrs`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1. `cnt1` is larger than 1***
