Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 1, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is larger than 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `cnt1` is now 1, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` depending on the value of `cnt1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
