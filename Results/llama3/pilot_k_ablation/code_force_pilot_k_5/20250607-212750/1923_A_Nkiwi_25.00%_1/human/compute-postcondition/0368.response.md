Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. The number of ones in `arrs` is more than 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `cnt0`, which is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of ones in `arrs` is still more than 1, and `stdin` still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.
