To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`. At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 3, and `arrs` has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 4.

The state of `arrs` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables, `t`, `length`, `cnt0`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 4**
