The only variables in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `idx` and `arrs`. If `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, `arrs` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be increased by 1, so `idx` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `arrs` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `idx` is 3, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is neither 0 nor 1, or if the first element of `arrs` is 0 but the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is 1. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `arrs`.**
