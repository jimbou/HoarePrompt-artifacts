Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 1 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 if `cnt1` is 2, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, making it either 1 or 2. The value of `ans` has also been updated based on the new value of `cnt1`. If `cnt1` is 1, then `ans` remains 0. If `cnt1` is 2, then `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
