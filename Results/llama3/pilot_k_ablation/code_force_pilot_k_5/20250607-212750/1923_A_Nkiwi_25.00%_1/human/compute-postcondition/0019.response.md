Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `idx+1` elements, `idx` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains at least `t-2` lines. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
