Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 3, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and the first element of `arrs` is 1, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0.***
