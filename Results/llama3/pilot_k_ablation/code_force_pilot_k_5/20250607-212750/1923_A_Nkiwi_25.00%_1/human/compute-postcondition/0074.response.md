Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)` lines, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, and if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1. If `cnt1` is either 0 or 1, `cnt1` retains its value and `ans` is 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the answer which is either 0 or cnt0 is being printed**
