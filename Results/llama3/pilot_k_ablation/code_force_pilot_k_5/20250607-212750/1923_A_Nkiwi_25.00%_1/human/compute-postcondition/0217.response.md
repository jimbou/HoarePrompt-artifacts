Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, `cnt1` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then if the last element of `arrs` is 0, the current value of `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one. Otherwise, the current value of `cnt0` remains the same.**
