The only variable in the loop head is variable  idx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `idx` and `arrs`. If `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is either 2 or not equal to 2, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be increased by 1 and `arrs` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is either 3 or not equal to 3, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`. `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0, and the value of `ans` is being printed. `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt0` is updated accordingly if `arrs[idx]` is 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is updated to 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 2 plus the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if the last element of `arrs` is not 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state.**
