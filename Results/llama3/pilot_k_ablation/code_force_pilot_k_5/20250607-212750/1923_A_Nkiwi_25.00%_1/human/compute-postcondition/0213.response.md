Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is `len(arrs)-1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, or the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one if `cnt1` is larger than 1, and `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-2` lines. The first element of `arrs` is 0. The current value of the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been decremented by 1, as it was the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the last element of `arrs` is 0, so it was counted in `cnt0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
