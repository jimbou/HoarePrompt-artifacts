Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines, `cnt0` is either 1 or 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.
