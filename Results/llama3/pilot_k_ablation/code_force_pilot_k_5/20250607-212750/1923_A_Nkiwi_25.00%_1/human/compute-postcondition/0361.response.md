Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first element being 0 and the last element being 0, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element is still being stored in `ans` and is being printed. The stdin still contains at least `t-len(arrs)-3` lines.
