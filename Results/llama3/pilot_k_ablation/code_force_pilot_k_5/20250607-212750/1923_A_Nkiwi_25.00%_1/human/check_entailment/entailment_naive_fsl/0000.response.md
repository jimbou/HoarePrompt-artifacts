Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program outputs 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program does not correctly count the number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The issue with the program is that it only counts the number of zeros in the array, but it does not consider the position of the zeros and the chips. It simply assumes that the number of zeros is equal to the number of operations required, which is not always the case.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the longest sequence of zeros in the array and move the chips to the left of that sequence. The number of operations required is equal to the length of that sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max_zeros = 0
        current_zeros = 0
        for num in arrs:
            if num == 0:
                current_zeros += 1
                max_zeros = max(max_zeros, current_zeros)
            else:
                current_zeros = 0
        print(max_zeros)

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.
