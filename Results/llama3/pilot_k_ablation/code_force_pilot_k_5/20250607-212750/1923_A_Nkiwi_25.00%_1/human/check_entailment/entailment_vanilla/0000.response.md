Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by counting the number of zeros in the array and using that as the answer. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires us to move the chips (represented by 1s) to form a single block without any free cells (represented by 0s) between them. The minimum number of operations required to achieve this is not simply the count of zeros in the array.

The correct approach would be to find the longest contiguous block of 1s in the array and then count the number of zeros between the blocks of 1s. This would give us the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

However, the given program does not implement this approach correctly. It only counts the number of zeros in the array and uses that as the answer, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
