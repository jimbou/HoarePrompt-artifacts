Reasoning: 

The given program is trying to solve the problem by counting the number of zeros in the array, excluding the first element. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual positions of the zeros and ones in the array. The program also has unnecessary conditions and variables, such as `cnt1` and the check for `arrs[0] == 0` or `arrs[0] == 1`.

A correct approach would be to find the first and last indices of the ones in the array, and then count the number of zeros between these indices. This would give the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

Correctness: **False**
