Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the range of `n` to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once.

The program correctly handles the cases where the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`) or occurs only once (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`). In the latter case, it checks if it's the first occurrence of a number that appears only once (`not once`), and if so, it sets the answer to `i + 1`. Otherwise, it sets the answer to `i`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
