Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX score. It uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1 and checks the count of each number. If a number is not present in the array (i.e., its count is 0), it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number is present only once and it's the first time it encounters a number with a count of 1, it sets the answer to the next number and sets a flag to indicate that it has already encountered a number with a count of 1. If it encounters another number with a count of 1, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array contains all numbers from 0 to n-1, the MEX score is n.
* When the array contains a number only once, the MEX score is the next number.
* When the array contains multiple numbers with a count of 1, the MEX score is the smallest number that is not present in the array.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the array is empty or when all numbers in the array have a count greater than 1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game strategy and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
