Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array c, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array. The program iterates through the array and uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number. It then iterates through the range of numbers from 0 to n-1 and checks if the number is missing from the array or appears only once. If it finds such a number, it prints it as the answer.

The program correctly handles the case where the number appears only once, in which case the answer is the next number. It also correctly handles the case where the number is missing from the array, in which case the answer is the smallest missing number.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the program iterates through the array twice: once to count the occurrences of each number, and once to find the smallest missing or single-occurring number.

The space complexity of the program is also O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number, which requires O(n) space.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
