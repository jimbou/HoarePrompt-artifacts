Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `arr` using a dictionary `counter`.

2. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the current number is present in the `counter` dictionary. If it's not present, it means that Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, and the program sets `ans` to this number and breaks the loop.

3. If the current number is present in the `counter` dictionary and its count is 1, it means that Bob can choose this number to minimize the score. In this case, the program checks if `once` is `False`. If it is, the program sets `once` to `True` and `ans` to `i + 1`. This is because Alice can choose the next number to maximize the score.

4. If the current number is present in the `counter` dictionary and its count is 1, and `once` is `True`, it means that Bob has already chosen a number to minimize the score. In this case, the program sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

5. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1.

Correctness: **True**
