Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first, second and third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr`, 2 for the first element of `arr` and 2 for the third element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the counter for the third element in the list `arr` is incremented by 1, so its count is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
