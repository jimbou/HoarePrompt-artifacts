To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3 and `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 4. Since `t` is a constant, its value remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in `arr`, `once` is True, and `i` is `n` - 1**
