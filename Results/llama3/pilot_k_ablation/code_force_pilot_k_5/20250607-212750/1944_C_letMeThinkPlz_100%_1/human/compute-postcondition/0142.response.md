The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of the original `arr` list as keys and their respective counts, `i` is 1**
