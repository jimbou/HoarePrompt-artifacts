Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, and the value of `i` is present in the `counter` dictionary with a count greater than 0. Either the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is not equal to 1 or `once` is True.***
