Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 3, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the third element in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 3, as the code increments the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
