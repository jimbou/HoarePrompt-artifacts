Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 4, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then i is 1, ans is 2, and once is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same: i is 1, ans is 1, and once is False.***
