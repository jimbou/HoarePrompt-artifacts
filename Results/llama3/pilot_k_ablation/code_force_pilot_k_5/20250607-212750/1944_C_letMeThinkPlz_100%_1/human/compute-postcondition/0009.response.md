The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 4 integers the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 integers and the i is the fourth integer in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 4 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 3, `i` is the fourth integer in the list**
