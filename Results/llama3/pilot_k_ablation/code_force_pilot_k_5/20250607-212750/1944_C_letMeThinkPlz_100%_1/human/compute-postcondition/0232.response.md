Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, once is True, and i is n - 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `arr`. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `counter`. 

After the execution of the code, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers. The values of `t`, `_`, `ans`, `once`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `counter` dictionary is now empty.
