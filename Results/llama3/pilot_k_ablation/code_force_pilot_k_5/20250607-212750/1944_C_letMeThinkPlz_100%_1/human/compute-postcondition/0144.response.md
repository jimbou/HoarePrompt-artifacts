The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `once`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is 1, `ans` becomes 2.

The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 1, once is True, ans is 2**
