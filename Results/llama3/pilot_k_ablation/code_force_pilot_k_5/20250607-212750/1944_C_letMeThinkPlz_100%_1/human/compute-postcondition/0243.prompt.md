Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, once is True, and i is n - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the first element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 2, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the second element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 3, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the third element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the fourth element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 5, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the fifth element in `arr`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
