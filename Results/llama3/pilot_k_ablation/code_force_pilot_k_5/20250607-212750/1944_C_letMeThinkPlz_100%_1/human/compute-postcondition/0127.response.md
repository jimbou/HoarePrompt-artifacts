Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 and the fourth element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the fifth element of `arr` as a key and its count is increased by 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the fifth element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the fifth element in the array `arr` is used as a key in the `counter` dictionary and its count is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, which is `ans`, is still being printed.
