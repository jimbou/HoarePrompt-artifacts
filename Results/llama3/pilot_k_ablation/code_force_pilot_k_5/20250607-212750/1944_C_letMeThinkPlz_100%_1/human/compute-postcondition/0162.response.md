Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then ans is 4 and once is True. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then ans is 3. Otherwise, ans is either 2 or 3, and once is either True or False.***
