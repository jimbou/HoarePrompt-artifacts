Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, i is increased by 1, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then ans is equal to i + 1 and once is True. Otherwise, no change is made.***
