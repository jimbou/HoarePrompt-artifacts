The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first, second and third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr`, 1 for the first element of `arr` and 1 for the third element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`**
