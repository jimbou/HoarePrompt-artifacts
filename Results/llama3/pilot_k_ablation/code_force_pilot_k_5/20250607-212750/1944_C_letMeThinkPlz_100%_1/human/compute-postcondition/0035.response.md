Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, i is an integer increased by 2, ans is equal to the new value of i.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `_` also remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and is greater than the new value of `i`. The list `arr` is still empty. The dictionary `counter` still contains all integers between 0 and `n-1` as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. The value of `i` has increased by 2. The variable `ans` has been assigned the new value of `i`.
