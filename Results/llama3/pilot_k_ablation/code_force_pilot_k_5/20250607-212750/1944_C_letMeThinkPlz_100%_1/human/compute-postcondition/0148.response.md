Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of the original `arr` list as keys and their respective counts, `i` is 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 2. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
