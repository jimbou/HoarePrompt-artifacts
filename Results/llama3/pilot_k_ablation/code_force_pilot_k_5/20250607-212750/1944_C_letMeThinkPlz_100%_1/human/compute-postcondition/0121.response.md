Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the second element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.**

The code increments the count of the second element of `arr` in the `counter` dictionary. The count of the second element of `arr` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
