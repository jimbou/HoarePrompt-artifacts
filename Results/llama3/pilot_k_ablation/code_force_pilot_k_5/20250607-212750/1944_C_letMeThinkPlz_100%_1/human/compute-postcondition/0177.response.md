The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element in `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `i` is the second element in `arr`**
