Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1, `i` is the first integer in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 2, `i` is the second integer in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 3, `i` is the third integer in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 4 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4, `i` is the fourth integer in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 5 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 5, `i` is the fifth integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
