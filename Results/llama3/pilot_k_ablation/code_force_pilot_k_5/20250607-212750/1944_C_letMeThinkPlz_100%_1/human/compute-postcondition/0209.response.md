Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 4, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 1, ans is 2, once is True**

Explanation: The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `once` to `True`. The second line updates the value of `ans` by adding 1 to the current value of `i`, which is 1. Therefore, `ans` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
