Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True, and i is n-1**

The code block first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. Then, it assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `arr`, making `arr` a list of `n` integers. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `counter`. 

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 3. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1. The value of `once` remains unchanged as True. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n-1`.
