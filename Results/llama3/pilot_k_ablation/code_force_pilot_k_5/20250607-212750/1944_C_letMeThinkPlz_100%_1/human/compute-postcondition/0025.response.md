Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer present in the `counter` dictionary with a count greater than 0. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is equal to `i + 1` and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 1, then `ans` is equal to the current value of `i` and `once` is False. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `once` remain unchanged.***
