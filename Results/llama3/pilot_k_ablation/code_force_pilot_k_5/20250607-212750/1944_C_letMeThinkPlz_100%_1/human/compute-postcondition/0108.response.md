Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 2, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, once is True, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, and i is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code only modifies the values of `once` and `ans`. The variable `once` is set to `True`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, which is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1.
