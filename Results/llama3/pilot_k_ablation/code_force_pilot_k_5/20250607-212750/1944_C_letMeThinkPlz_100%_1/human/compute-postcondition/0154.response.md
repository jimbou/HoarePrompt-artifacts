Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of the original `arr` list as keys and their respective counts, `i` is 2. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 3 and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `once` is either True or False.***
