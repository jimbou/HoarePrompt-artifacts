Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, ans is 0, once is False, i is the last element in the original arr list, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is 0, no changes are made. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then ans is i + 1, once is True, and the count of i in the counter dictionary is updated to 0. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is True, the count of i in the counter dictionary is updated to 0, and no other changes are made. In all cases, i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of the original `arr` list as keys and their respective counts, `i` is 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 2. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of the original `arr` list as keys and their respective counts, `i` is 2. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is 2. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 3 and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `once` is either True or False.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then ans is 4 and once is True. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then ans is 3. Otherwise, ans is either 2 or 3, and once is either True or False.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 4. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is 4 and once remains unchanged. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1, then ans is 5 if once is False and once becomes True, otherwise ans is 4. If counter.get(i, 0) is greater than 1, then ans is either 3 or 4, and once is either True or False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
