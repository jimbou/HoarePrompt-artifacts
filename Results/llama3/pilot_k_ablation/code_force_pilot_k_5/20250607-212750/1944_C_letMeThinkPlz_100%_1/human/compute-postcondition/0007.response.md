To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 3 integers, and `i` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 2, `i` is the third integer in the list**
