Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1, `i` is the first integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to include the first integer `i` from the list `arr` as a key with a value of 1, indicating that `i` has been encountered once. The other variables remain unchanged.
