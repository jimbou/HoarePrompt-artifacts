Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 2, `arr` is a list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is True and `ans` is equal to `i` + 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is True, then no change is made to `ans` and `once`, and `i` is increased by 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is not 1, then `i` is increased by 1, and no change is made to `ans` and `once`.***
