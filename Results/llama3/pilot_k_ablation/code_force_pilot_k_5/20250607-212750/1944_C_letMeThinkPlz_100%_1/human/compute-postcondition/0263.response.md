Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 2. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
