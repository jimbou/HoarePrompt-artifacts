Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 0. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is True. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is True.***
