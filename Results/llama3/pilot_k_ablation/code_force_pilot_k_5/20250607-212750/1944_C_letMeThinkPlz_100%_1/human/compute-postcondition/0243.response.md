Output State: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the last element in `arr`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the counter dictionary will contain all elements from the array as keys and their respective counts as values. The variable `i` will be the last element in the array, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
