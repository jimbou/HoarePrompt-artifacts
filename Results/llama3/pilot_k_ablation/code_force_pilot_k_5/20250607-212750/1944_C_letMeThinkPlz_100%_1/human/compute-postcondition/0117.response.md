Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True, i is n, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `once`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, which is read from the input. The `arr` variable is assigned a list of integers read from the input. The `counter` dictionary is reset to an empty dictionary. The value of `ans` is still the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, but its value is not updated since the counter dictionary is empty. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but 2 test cases less than before, as two inputs have been read.
