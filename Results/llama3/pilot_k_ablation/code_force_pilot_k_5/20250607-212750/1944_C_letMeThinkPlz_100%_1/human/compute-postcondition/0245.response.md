Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, ans is 0, once is False, and i is the last element in arr.**

In natural language, after the code executes, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The `counter` dictionary is not affected by the code snippet, so it still contains all elements from `arr` as keys with their respective counts as values. The variables `ans` and `once` are reassigned new values: `ans` is set to 0, and `once` is set to False.
