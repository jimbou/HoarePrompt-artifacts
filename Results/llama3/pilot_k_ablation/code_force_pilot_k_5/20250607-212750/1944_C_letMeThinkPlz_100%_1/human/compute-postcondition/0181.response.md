To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `arr` has at least 3 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 4 integers, and `i` must be the fourth element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 4 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element in `arr` as a key and its count is 1, and the second element in `arr` as a key and its count is increased by 1, and the third element in `arr` as a key and its count is 2, and the fourth element in `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `i` is the fourth element in `arr`.**
