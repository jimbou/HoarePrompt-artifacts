Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than i + 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, i is equal to ans, once is True.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 1. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 1. The list `arr` and the dictionary `counter` also remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the smallest integer between 0 and `n`-1 that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1. The value of `i` is now equal to `ans`. The value of `once` is now True.
