To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is False, `i` is 0**
