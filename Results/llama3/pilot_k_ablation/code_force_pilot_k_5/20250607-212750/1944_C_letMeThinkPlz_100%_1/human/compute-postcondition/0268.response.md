Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 2, ans is 2**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `ans`. Since `i` is 2, `ans` becomes 2. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
