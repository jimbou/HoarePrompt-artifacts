Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, `once` is False. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
