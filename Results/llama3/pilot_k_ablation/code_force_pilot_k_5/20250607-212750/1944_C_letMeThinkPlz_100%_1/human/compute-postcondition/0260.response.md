Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 1, once is True, ans is 2**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The variable `i` also retains its initial value of 1. The code introduces two new variables: `once` is set to `True`, and `ans` is calculated as `i + 1`, resulting in `ans` being 2.
