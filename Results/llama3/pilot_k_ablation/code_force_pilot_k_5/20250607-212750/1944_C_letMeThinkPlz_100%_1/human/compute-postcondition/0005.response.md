The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the i is the second integer in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1, `i` is the second integer in the list**
