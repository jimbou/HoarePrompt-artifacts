The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, ans is 0, once is False does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0**
