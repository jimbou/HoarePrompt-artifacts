The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts, the value of `ans` will be the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` or appears only once in `arr`.

Output: **the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1**
