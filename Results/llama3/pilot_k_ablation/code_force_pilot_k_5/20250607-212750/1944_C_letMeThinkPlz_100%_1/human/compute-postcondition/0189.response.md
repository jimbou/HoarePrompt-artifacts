Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, and `i` is 0. The current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, meaning that the element at index `i` in `arr` has not been encountered before.**
