The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 3**
