Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, ans is i + 1, once is True, i is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `once` is set to True, and the value of `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is 2. The value of `i` remains 1.
