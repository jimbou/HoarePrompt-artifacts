To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`**
