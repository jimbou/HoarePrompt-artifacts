The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, and the second line is a break statement that terminates the loop.

Since `i` is 3, `ans` becomes 3. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 3, ans is 3, once is either True or False**
