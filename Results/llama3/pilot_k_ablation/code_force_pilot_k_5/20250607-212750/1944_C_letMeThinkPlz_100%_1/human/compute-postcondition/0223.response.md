Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 3, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 3, once is True, ans is 4**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code. The variable `i` also retains its initial value of 3. The code introduces two new variables: `once` is set to `True`, and `ans` is calculated as `i + 1`, resulting in a value of 4.
