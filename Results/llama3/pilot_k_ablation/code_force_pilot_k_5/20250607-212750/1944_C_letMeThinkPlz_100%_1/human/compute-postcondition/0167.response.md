Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 4. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is 4. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then ans is 5 and once is True. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then ans is 4. Otherwise, ans is either 3 or 4, and once is either True or False. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1, then ans is 4 and once is False. Otherwise, ans and once are either 3 or 4 and True or False respectively.***
