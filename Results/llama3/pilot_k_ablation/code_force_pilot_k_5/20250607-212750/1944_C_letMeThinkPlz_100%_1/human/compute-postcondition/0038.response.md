Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and `n-1` as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer increased by 2. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, then `ans` is set to `i`.***
