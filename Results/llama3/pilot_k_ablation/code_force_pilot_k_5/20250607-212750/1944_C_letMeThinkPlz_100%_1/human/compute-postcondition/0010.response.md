Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 4 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4, `i` is the fourth integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but 2 test cases less than before. The list `arr` and the integer `n` also remain unchanged.
