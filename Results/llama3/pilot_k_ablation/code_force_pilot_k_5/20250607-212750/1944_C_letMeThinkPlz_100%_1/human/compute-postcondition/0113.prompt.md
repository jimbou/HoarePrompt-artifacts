Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is False, i is the last element in the list arr.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is False, `i` is 0. If the current value of `i` is not present in the `counter` dictionary, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `i` if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, otherwise `ans` remains the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts. If the current value of i is not present in the counter dictionary, then ans is set to i. Otherwise, if the count of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then ans is set to i + 1 and once is set to True. Otherwise, if the count of i in the counter dictionary is 1, then ans is set to i. Otherwise, ans remains the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is 0, then i is equal to ans, which is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is not 0, then i is increased by 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then ans is equal to i + 1 and once is True. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts. If the count of `i` in the counter dictionary is 0, then `i` is increased by 1 and ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, and once is True. If the count of `i` in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is equal to `i` + 1. If the count of `i` in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is True, then no change is made to ans and once, and i is increased by 1. If the count of `i` in the counter dictionary is not 0 or 1, then i is increased by 1, and no change is made to ans and once.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 2, `arr` is a list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 0, then `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n`-1 that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `i` is increased by 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is True and `ans` is equal to `i` + 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is True, then no change is made to `ans` and `once`, and `i` is increased by 1. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is not 0 or 1, then `i` is increased by 1, and no change is made to `ans` and `once`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
