Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 4, once is True, ans is 5**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 4. The variable `once` is set to `True` by the first line of the code. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, which is 5, by the second line of the code.
