Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, i is `i` + 1, once is True if the count of `i` in the counter dictionary is 1, otherwise no change is made**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `once` is set to True if the count of `i` in the counter dictionary is 1, otherwise no change is made. All other variables remain unchanged.
