Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, i is increased by 1, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 and is equal to i + 1, once is True**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `once`. The variable `once` is assigned the value `True`. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
