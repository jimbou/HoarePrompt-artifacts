The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the count of `i` in `arr` and the value of `once`.

Since the exact count of `i` in `arr` and the value of `once` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans` according to the following rules:

*   If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is `i`.
*   If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is `i + 1`.
*   If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is `i`.
*   If the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 1, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is `i + 1`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value determined by the count of i in arr and the value of once)**
