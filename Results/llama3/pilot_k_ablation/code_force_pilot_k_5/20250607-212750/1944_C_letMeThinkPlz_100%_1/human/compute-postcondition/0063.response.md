Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first and second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr` and 1 for the first element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the second element in the list `arr`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, so it now has a count of 2 for the second element of `arr`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 is still `ans`. The value of `once` is still dependent on whether `ans` is equal to `i + 1`. The second element of `arr` is still `i`.
