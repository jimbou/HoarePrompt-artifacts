Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is False, `i` is 0. If the current value of `i` is not present in the `counter` dictionary, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `i` if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, otherwise `ans` remains the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1.***
