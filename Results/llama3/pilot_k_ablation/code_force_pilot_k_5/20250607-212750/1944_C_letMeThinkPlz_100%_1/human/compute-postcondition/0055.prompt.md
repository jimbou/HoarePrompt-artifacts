Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, ans is 0, once is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer. If `i` is not present in the `counter` dictionary or its count is 0, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `i` is present in the `counter` dictionary with a count greater than 0, then if the count of `i` is equal to 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is equal to `i + 1` and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the count of `i` is equal to 1, `ans` is equal to the current value of `i` and `once` is False. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `once` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, i is an integer increased by 1. If the value of i in the counter dictionary is 0, then ans is equal to the value of i. If the value of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then once is set to True and ans is i + 1. Otherwise, if the value of i in the counter dictionary is 1, then ans is equal to the new value of i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and `n-1` as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer increased by 2. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 0, then `ans` is equal to the new value of `i`. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, if the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, then `ans` is set to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and `n-1` as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer increased by 2. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 0, then `ans` is `i`. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, then `ans` is `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is either `i`, `i+1` or `i` depending on the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary and the value of `once`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and `n-1` as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer increased by 2, `ans` is either `i`, `i+1` or `i` depending on the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary and the value of `once`, `once` is True if the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False otherwise. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 0, then `ans` is `i`. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is not 0, then `ans` is either `i` or `i+1` depending on the value of `once`. If the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is `i+1` and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is True, otherwise `once` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
