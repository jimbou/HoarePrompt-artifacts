Output State: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the last element in `arr`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `once` as in the initial state. However, the `counter` dictionary will now contain all elements from `arr` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The variable `i` will be the last element in the list `arr`.
