Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 2, `i` is the second integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 2, since it was previously 1 and the code increments its value by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but 2 test cases less than before. The list `arr` and the integer `n` maintain their original properties. The variable `_` remains 0, and `t` is still a positive integer.
