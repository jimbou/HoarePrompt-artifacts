Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True, i is the last element in the original arr list, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `arr` is empty, the dictionary `counter` contains all elements from the original `arr` list as keys with their respective counts, and the variable `i` holds the last element from the original `arr` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
