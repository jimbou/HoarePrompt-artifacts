Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, and the value of `i` exists in `arr` and its count in `counter` is greater than 0. The current value of `counter` for key `i` is 1 and the current value of `once` is False***
