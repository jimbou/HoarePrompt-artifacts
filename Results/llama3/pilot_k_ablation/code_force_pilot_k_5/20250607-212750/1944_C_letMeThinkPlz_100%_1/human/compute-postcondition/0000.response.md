Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case less than before. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the number of test cases in the stdin is reduced by 1. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs each: an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n` integers.
