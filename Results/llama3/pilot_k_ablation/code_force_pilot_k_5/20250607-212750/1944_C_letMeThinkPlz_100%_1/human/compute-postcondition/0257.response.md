Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the value of `i` does not exist in `arr` or its count in `counter` is 0, then `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, then if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` is set to True. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is set to `i` and `once` is set to False. In all other cases, `ans` remains unchanged.**
