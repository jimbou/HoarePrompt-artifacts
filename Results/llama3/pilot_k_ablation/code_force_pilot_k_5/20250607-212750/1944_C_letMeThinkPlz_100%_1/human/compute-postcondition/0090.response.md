Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1.**
