To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already stated to be an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it is within the range of the loop.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, ans is 0, once is False, i is 0**
