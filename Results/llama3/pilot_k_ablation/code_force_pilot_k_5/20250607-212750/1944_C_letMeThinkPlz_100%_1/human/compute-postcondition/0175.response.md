To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

Given the initial state, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `arr` must have at least 1 element, so its length is at least 1.
* `i` will take on the value of the first element in `arr`.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `counter`, `ans`, and `once`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `i` is the first element in `arr`**
