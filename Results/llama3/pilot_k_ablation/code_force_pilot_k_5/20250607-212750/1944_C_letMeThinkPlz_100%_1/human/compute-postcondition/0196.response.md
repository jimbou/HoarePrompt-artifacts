Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, ans is i, once is False, i is 0, the count of i in arr is more than 0, and either the count of i in arr is not equal to 1 or once is True. The current value of counter.get(i, 0) is 1**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the value of `ans` has been updated to `i`, which is 0. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
