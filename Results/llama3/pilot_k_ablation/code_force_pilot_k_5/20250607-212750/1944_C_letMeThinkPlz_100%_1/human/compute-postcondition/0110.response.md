Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than `i` + 2, `arr` is a list, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements of `arr` as keys and their respective counts. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1, then `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n`-1 that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, and `once` is True. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is not 1, then `i` is increased by 1, and no change is made to `ans` and `once`.***
