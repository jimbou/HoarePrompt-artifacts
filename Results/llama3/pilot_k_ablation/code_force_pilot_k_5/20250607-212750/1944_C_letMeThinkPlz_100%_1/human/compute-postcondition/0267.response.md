Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 2, once is True, ans is 3**

In this output state, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of two new variables: `once` and `ans`. The value of `once` is set to `True`, and the value of `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is 3 since `i` is 2. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
