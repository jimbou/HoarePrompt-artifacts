To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in arr:`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4
* `_` is 4
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5
* `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 4 elements
* `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4
* `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr
* `once` is True
* `i` is the fourth element in `arr`

Since the loop head only involves the variable `i` and the list `arr`, we can only adjust the states of these two objects.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `i` should be the next element in the list. Since `i` is currently the fourth element in `arr`, the next element would be the fifth element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4, `ans` is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, `once` is True, and `i` is the fifth element in `arr`**
