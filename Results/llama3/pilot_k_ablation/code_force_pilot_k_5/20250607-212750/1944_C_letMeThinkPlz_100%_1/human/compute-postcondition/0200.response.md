The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 0, `once` is False, and `i` is 0. If the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 0, then `i` is 0, and the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 0. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is `i` + 1 and `once` is True. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is True.**
