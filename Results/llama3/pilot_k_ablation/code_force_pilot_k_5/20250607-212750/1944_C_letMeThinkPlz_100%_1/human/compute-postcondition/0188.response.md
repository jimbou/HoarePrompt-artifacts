To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

The variable `i` is initialized to the last element in `arr`, but for the loop to start, `i` should be 0, which is the first index in the range.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, and `i` is 0**
