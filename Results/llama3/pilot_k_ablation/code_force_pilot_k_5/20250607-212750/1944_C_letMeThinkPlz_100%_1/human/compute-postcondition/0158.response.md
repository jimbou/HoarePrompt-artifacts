Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 3, ans is 4, once is True**

The code snippet modifies the values of `once` and `ans`. The first line sets `once` to `True`, and the second line sets `ans` to `i + 1`, which is 4 since `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
