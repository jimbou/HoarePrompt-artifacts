Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 2. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is False, then ans is 3 and once is True. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is True, then ans is 2. If the count of i in arr is not 1, then ans is 1 and once is False.***
