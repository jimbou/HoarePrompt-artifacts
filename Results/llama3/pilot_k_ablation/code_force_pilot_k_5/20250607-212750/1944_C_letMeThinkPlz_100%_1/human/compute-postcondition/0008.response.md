Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 3, `i` is the third integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 3, as it was previously 2 and the code increments its value by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `_` being 0, stdin containing multiple test cases, `n` being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` being a list of at least 3 integers between 0 and n-1, and `i` being the third integer in the list.
