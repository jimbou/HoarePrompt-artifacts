The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `i` is an integer increased by 1**
