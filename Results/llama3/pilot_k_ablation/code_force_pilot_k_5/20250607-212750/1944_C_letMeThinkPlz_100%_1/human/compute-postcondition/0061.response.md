Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to include the first element of `arr` as a key with a count of 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The `ans` variable still represents the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, but its value may have changed due to the update of the `counter` dictionary. The `once` variable still depends on the value of `ans` and `i`.
