The code snippet provided is quite short and doesn't modify many variables. Here's the analysis:

The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`. Since `i` is 3, `ans` becomes 3.

The second line is a `break` statement, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, this statement doesn't have any effect.

Now, let's look at the variables that are not modified by the code:

* `t` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.
* `_` is still 3.
* `n` is still an integer greater than 3.
* `arr` is still a list of `n` integers.
* `counter` is still a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`.

The only variable that is modified by the code is `ans`, which is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 3, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 3, ans is 3**
