Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 2, ans is 3, once is True**

In this output state, the value of `once` has been updated to `True`, and the value of `ans` has been updated to `3`, which is the result of adding `1` to the initial value of `i`, which is `2`. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values as specified in the precondition.
