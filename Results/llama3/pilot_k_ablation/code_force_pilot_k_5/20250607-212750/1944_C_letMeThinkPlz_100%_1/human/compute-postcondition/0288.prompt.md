Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 4, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, ans is 0, once is False, and i is the last element in arr.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the value of `i` does not exist in `arr` or its count in `counter` is 0, then `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, then if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` is set to True. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is set to `i` and `once` is set to False. In all other cases, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 2. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 1, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the count of 2 in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 2. If the count of 2 in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 3. If the count of 2 in `arr` is 1, then `ans` is 2. If the count of 2 in `arr` is more than 1, then no change is made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the count of 2 in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 2. If the count of 2 in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 3. If the count of 2 in `arr` is 1, then `ans` is 2. If the count of 2 in `arr` is more than 1, then no change is made to `ans`. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, then `ans` is 5 and `i` is 5. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 6. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is True, then `i` is 5. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not 1, then `i` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 6, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 6. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 6. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 7. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is 6. If the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 1, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 7.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
