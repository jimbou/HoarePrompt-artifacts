Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is an empty dictionary**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `_` also remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2 due to the execution of the code. The variable `n` now holds an integer value between 1 and 2 * 10^5, which was input from stdin. The variable `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and `n-1`, also input from stdin. The variable `counter` is an empty dictionary, initialized by the code.
