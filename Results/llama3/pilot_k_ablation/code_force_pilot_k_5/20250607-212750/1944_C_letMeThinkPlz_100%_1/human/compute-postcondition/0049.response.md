Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, i is an integer increased by 2, ans is i, once is True if the value of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `_` also remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of `i`. The list `arr` remains empty. The dictionary `counter` still contains all integers between 0 and `n-1` as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. The value of `i` has been increased by 2. The value of `ans` is now `i`. The value of `once` is True if the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is 1 and False otherwise. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 2.
