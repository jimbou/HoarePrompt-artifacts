The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 2**
