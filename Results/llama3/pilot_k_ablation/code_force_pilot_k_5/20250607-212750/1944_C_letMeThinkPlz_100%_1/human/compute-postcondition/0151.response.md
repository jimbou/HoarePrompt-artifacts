Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, i is 2, ans is 3, once is True**

The code snippet modifies the values of `once` and `ans`. The first line sets `once` to `True`, regardless of its previous value. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 3 since `i` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
