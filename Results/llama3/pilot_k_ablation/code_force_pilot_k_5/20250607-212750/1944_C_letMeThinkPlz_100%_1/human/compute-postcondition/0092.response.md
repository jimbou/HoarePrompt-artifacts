The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, i is not specified but must be increased by 1, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1**
