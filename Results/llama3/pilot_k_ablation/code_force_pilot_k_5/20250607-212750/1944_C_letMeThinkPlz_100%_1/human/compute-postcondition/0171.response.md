Based on the initial state, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1.

Since `arr` is an empty list, the `counter` dictionary is also empty. Therefore, the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary is 0.

Output: **0**
