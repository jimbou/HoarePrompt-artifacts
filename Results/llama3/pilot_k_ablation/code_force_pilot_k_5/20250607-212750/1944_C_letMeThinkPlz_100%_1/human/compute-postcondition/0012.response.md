The value of `counter[i]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The current value of `counter[i]` is 4, so the new value of `counter[i]` is 5. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before. The output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of at least 5 integers between 0 and n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 5, `i` is the fifth integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.
