The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, and the second line is a break statement that terminates the loop.

Since `i` is 1, `ans` becomes 1. The break statement does not affect any variables.

The final state is:
Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 4, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 1, ans is 1, once is False**
