Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, ans is i + 1, once is True, i is an integer present in the counter dictionary with a count greater than 0. The current value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count equal to 1.**

In this final state, the value of `once` has been changed to `True`, and the value of `ans` has been updated to `i + 1`, where `i` is an integer present in the `counter` dictionary with a count greater than 0. The current value of `i` is present in the `counter` dictionary with a count equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
