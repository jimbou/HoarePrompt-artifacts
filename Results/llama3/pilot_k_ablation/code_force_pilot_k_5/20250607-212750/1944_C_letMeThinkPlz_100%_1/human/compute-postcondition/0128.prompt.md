Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True, i is n, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the second element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 and the fourth element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the fourth element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 and the fourth element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1 and the fifth element of `arr` as a key and its count is increased by 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True, `i` is the fifth element in `arr`, and the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that is not present in the `counter` dictionary or has a count of 1 which is `ans` is being printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
