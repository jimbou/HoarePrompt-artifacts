The code snippet provided contains a break statement, which terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, there is no loop in the given code snippet, so the break statement will raise a SyntaxError. 

Since the break statement is not enclosed in a loop, it will not be executed, and the program will terminate with an error. Therefore, the state of the variables will not be modified.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 2, ans is 1, once is False**
