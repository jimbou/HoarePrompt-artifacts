Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 4, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is True, then once is False and ans is i. Otherwise, the values of ans and once remain unchanged.**
