Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, ans is 0, once is False, and i is the last element in arr.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr. If the count of i in arr is 0, then ans is 0, once is False, and i is 0. If the count of i in arr is more than 0, then i is 0, and the count of i in arr is more than 0. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is False, then ans is i + 1 and once is True. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is True, then ans is i and once is False. Otherwise, ans is 0 and once is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with each element in `arr` as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is `i` + 1 and `once` is True. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `once` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 4, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr. If the count of i in counter is 0, the state of the variables remains the same: i is 1, ans is 1, and once is False. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then i is 1, ans is 2, and once is True. If the count of i in counter is greater than 1 or once is True, the state of the variables remains the same: i is 1, ans is 1, and once is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 2. If the count of i in arr is 0, then ans is 1 and once is False. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is False, then ans is 3 and once is True. If the count of i in arr is 1 and once is True, then ans is 2. If the count of i in arr is not 1, then ans is 1 and once is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 3, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, i is 3. If the count of the element at index i in arr is 0, then ans is 3. If the count of the element at index i in arr is not 0, then if the count of the element at index i in arr is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is 4. If the count of the element at index i in arr is not 1 or once is True, then if the count of the element at index i in arr is 1, ans is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
