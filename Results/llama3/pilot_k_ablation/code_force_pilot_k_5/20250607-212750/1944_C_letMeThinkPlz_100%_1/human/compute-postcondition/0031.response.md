Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, i is an integer increased by 1. If the value of i in the counter dictionary is 1, then ans is equal to the new value of i.***
