Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, i is equal to n, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first and second element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr` and 1 for the first element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the second element in the list `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first, second and third element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr`, 2 for the first element of `arr` and 2 for the third element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first, second, third and fourth element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr`, 2 for the first element of `arr`, 2 for the third element of `arr` and 2 for the fourth element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the fourth element in the list `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary with the first, second, third, fourth and fifth element of `arr` as a key and its count is 2 for the second element of `arr`, 2 for the first element of `arr`, 2 for the third element of `arr`, 2 for the fourth element of `arr` and 3 for the fifth element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, `once` is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, `i` is the fifth element in the list `arr`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
