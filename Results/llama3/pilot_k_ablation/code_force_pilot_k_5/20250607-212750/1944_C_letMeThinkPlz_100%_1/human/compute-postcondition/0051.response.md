Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than the new value of i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, i is an integer increased by 2, ans is i, once is True if the value of i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False otherwise**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is an integer increased by 2. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `once` is still dependent on the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary.
