Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input list `arr` is empty, and the dictionary `counter` contains all the integers from 0 to n-1 as keys, with their corresponding values being the number of times each integer appears in the original list. The other variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
