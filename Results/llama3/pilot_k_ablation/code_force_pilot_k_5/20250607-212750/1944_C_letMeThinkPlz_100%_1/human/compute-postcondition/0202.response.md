Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer greater than 4, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, once is True, ans is i + 1, i is 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `once` is set to `True`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. The value of `i` is 0, as it is not modified by the code.
