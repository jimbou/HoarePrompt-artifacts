Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case less than before. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers between 0 and n-1 as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True if ans is equal to i + 1 and False otherwise, i is equal to n, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than before, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of arr as keys and their respective counts, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True, i is n, and the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1 which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all elements of the original arr list as keys and their respective counts, ans is the smallest integer between 0 and n-1 that is not present in the counter dictionary or has a count of 1, once is True, and i is n-1, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 3, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with each element in arr as a key and its count is the number of times it appears in arr, ans is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr, once is True, and i is n - 1, and ans is printed, which is the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in arr

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is `i`. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is `i + 1`. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is `i`. If the count of `i` in `arr` is more than 1, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is `i + 1`, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
