Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The current value of `a` is higher than the current value of `b`, and the values of `a` and `b` are being printed, where `a` is [a] and `b` is [b]**
