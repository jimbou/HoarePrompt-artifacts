Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 4, `t` is 0, `i` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the fourth line of stdin, stdin contains `n-7` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with `a` first if `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` first otherwise.***
