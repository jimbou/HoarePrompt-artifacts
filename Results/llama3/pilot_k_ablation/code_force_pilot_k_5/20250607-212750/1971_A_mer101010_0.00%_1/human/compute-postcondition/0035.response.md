To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(n):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, as `n` is a constant within the loop's scope.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `t` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**
