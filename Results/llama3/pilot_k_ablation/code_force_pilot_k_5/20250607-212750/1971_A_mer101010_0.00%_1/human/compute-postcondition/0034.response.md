Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with the larger value first. If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed.**
