Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If the first `a` is greater than the first `b`, the values of the first `a` and the first `b` are printed. If the first `a` is less than or equal to the first `b`, the values of the first `b` and the first `a` are printed. and this is printed: b and a**
