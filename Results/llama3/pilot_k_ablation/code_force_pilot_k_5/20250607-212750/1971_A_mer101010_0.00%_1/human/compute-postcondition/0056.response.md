Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input. It then prints each pair, with the larger number first. If the numbers in a pair are equal, it prints them in the order they were read. The function does not return any value, but rather produces output directly to the console.**
