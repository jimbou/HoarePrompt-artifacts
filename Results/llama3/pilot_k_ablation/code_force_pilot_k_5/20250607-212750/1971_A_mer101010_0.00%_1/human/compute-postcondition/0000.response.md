Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 100. The second line initializes `t` to 0. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain `n` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are between 0 and 9.
