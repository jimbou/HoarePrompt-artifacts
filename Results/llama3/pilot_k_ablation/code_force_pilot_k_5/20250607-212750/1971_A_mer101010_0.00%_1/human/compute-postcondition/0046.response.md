Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `t` is 0, `i` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the fourth line of stdin, stdin contains `n-7` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the fourth line of stdin. The stdin now contains `n-7` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9), since one line has been read to update the values of `a` and `b`.
