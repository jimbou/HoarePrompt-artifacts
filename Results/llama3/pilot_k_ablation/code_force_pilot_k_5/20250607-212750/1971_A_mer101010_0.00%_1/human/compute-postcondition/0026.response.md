Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If the first `a` is greater than the first `b`, the values of the first `a` and the first `b` are printed. If the first `a` is less than or equal to the first `b`, the values of the first `b` and the first `a` are printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers read from the second line of stdin. The values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-4` lines, each with two space-separated integers. The print statements from the initial state still apply, but now they refer to the new values of `a` and `b`.
