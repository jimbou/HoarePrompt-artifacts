The `print(a, ' ', b)` statement will print the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the fourth line of stdin.

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, their values will be two single-digit numbers.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9)   (where b is an integer between 0 and 9)**
