Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` equals `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` does not equal `b`, the values of `b` and `a` are printed.***
