Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are being printed in the order that makes `a` appear first if it is greater than `b`, otherwise, they are printed in the order that makes `b` appear first if it is greater than `a`, or they are printed in the same order if they are equal.**
