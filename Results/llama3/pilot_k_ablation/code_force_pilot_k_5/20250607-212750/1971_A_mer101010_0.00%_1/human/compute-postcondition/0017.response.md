The `print(a, ' ', b)` statement will print the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the first line of stdin.

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, they can take any value within this range. However, the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the precondition.

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of `a` and `b`, separated by a space.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9)  b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9)**
