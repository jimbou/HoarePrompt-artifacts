Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `t` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the second line of stdin, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `n-5` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 9, since one line has been read to assign values to `a` and `b`.
