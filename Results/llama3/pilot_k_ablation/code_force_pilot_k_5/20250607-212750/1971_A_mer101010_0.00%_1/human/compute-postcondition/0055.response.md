Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the last line of stdin, stdin is empty. The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with the larger value first. If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The value of `t` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The value of `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop iterates `n` times and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
* The values of `a` and `b` will be the integers read from the last line of stdin, as the loop reads two integers from stdin in each iteration.
* Stdin will be empty, as all lines have been read and processed by the loop.
* The values of `a` and `b` will be printed, with the larger value first. If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` will be printed.
