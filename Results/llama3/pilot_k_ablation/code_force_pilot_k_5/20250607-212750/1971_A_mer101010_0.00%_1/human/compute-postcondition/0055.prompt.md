Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 100, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a > b:
        print(a, ' ', b)
    elif a == b:
        print(a, ' ', b)
    else:
        print(b, ' ', a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are being printed in the order that makes `a` appear first if it is greater than `b`, otherwise, they are printed in the order that makes `b` appear first if it is greater than `a`, or they are printed in the same order if they are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the values of `b` and `a` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with the larger value first. If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `t` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed as "[a] [b]". If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is less than `b`, the value of `b` is printed first, followed by the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 4, `t` is 0, `i` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the fourth line of stdin, stdin contains `n-7` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with `a` first if `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` first otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
