Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `t` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 that have been read from the second line of stdin, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed as "[a] [b]". If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is less than `b`, the value of `b` is printed first, followed by the value of `a`.***
