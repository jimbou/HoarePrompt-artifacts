To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 100, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1, which is a necessary condition for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is not initialized before the loop, so we need to adjust its state. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, we can set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables, `t` and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9), `i` is 0**
