Reasoning:

The given program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input. It then prints each pair, with the larger number first. If the numbers in a pair are equal, it prints them in the order they were read.

The program correctly implements the required logic:

- It reads the number of test cases `n` and initializes a variable `t` to 0, which is not used anywhere in the program but does not affect the correctness.
- It iterates `n` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` in each iteration.
- Inside the loop, it checks the values of `a` and `b` and prints them in the correct order based on the conditions:
  - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
  - If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b` (essentially printing the same number twice, which is correct since they are equal).
  - If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the desired output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
