Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
3. Inside the function, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
4. It then initializes a variable `t` to 0, but this variable is not used anywhere in the function.
5. The function then enters a loop that runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.
6. In each iteration of the loop, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
7. It then uses an if-elif-else statement to determine the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b`.
8. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
9. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
10. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.
11. The function does not return any value.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers and prints the result in the required format. The use of the `t` variable is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.
