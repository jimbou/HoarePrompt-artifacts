Functionality: **The function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b. It then compares each pair of integers and prints 'Alice' if a is less than b, 'Bob' if a is greater than or equal to b. The function continues this process until all input lines have been processed, at which point stdin is empty.**
