The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_rep` and `t`. If `_rep` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 2, `t` is an integer between 2 and 999 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed one more time `_rep` is 3 and `t` is an integer between 3 and 999 (inclusive).
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 999 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 3, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.**
