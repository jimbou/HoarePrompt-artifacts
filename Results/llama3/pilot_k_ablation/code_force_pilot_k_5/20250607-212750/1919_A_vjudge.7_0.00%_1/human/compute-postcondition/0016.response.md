Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `_rep` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_rep`, and the remaining input lines in stdin are unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two integers read from the first line of input. The condition for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' is still dependent on the values of `n` and `k`.
