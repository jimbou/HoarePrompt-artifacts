The only variables in the loop head are variable `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_rep` and `t`. If `_rep` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_rep` is increased by 1 so `_rep` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `_rep` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed.**
