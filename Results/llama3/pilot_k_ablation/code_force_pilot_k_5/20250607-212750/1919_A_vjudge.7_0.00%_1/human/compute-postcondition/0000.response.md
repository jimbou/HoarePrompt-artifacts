The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the first line of the input, and the remaining lines of the input are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
