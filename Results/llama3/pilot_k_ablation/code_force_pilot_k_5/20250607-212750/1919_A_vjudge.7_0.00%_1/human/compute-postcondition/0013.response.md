Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `_rep` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If the current value of `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed.***
