Output State: **`_rep` is equal to `t`, stdin is empty, `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed, and 'Bob' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_rep` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The standard input `stdin` will be empty since all input lines have been processed. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input. The output will be a sequence of 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the comparison of `n` and `k` in each iteration, with 'Bob' being printed when `n` is equal to `k`.
