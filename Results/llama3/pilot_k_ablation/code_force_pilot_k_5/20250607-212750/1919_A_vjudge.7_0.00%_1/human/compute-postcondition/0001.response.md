The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust `_rep` to be 0 (the initial value of the loop variable) and keep `t` as is.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `_rep` is 0**
