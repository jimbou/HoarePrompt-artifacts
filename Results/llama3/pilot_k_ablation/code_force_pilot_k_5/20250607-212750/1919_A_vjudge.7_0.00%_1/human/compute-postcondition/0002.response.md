Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `_rep` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been reduced by 1 because one line of input has been consumed. The values of `n` and `k` have been assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of input. The value of `_rep` remains unchanged.
