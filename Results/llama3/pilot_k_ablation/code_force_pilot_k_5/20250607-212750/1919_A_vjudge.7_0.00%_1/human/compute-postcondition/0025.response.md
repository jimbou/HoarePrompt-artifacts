To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _rep in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_rep`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_rep` and `t`. If `_rep` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 999 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_rep` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `_rep` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.**
