Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 999 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 3, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the two integers read from the input, and the number of lines in stdin has decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
