Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 999 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 4, stdin contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9). If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is being printed.***
