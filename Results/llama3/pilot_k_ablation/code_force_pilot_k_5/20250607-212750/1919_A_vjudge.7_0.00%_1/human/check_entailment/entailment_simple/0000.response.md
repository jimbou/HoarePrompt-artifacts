Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn, and that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. However, the program does not take into account the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make. It simply compares the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on that comparison.

The correct solution should consider the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make. The key observation is that the player who has the chance to make the last move will win the game. This is because the last move will always be to remove the last coin from the opponent's wallet, leaving the opponent with no coins and unable to make a move.

The correct solution can be achieved by checking if the sum of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd or even. If the sum is odd, then Alice will win the game, because she will have the chance to make the last move. If the sum is even, then Bob will win the game, because he will have the chance to make the last move.

Here is the correct code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _rep in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if (n + k) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

Correctness: **False**
