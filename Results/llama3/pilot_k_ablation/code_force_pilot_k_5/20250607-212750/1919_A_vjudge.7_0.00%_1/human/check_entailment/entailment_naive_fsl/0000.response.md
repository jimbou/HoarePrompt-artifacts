Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins, not just the comparison of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

A counterexample is when Alice has 5 coins and Bob has 3 coins. The program will output "Bob", but Alice will actually win the game because the total number of coins (5 + 3 = 8) is even, and Alice makes the first move.

The correct solution should consider the parity of the total number of coins, not just the comparison of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
