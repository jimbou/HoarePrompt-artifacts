Reasoning:

The given program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer. It then prints each pair with the maximum value first and the minimum value second. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The program uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python to find the maximum and minimum of each pair of integers, which is the most straightforward and efficient way to solve this problem.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing each pair with the maximum value first and the minimum value second.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
