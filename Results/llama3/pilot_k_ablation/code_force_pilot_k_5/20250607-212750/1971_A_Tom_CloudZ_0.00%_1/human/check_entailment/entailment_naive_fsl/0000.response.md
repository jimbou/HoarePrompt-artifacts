Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input values of x and y are equal. In this case, the program should output the same value twice, but the program prints the maximum value first, followed by the minimum value. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program should output 3 3, but it outputs 3 3 which is incorrect.

The correct output for the example input 3 3 should be 3 3, but the program outputs 3 3.
