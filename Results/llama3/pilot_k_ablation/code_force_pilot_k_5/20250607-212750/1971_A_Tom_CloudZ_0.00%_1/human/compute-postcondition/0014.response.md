Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is [min(a, b)] are being printed, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two space-separated integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are still being printed. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), because one line has been read and processed.
