The code prints the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is [min(a, b)]. Where `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9.

Output: **[max(a, b)], [min(a, b)] (where max(a, b) is the maximum value between a and b, and min(a, b) is the minimum value between a and b)**
