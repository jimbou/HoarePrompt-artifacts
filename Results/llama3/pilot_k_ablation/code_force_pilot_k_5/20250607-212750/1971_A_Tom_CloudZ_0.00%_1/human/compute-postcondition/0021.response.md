Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), _ is t-1, a and b are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains 0 lines, and the maximum and minimum values between a and b are being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variable `_` has reached the value of `t-1`, indicating that the loop has finished. The variables `a` and `b` still hold the last pair of integers read from the input, and the maximum and minimum values between them are being printed. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all the lines have been read and processed by the loop.
