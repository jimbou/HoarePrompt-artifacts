Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are being printed, where the maximum value is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value is [min(a, b)].**
