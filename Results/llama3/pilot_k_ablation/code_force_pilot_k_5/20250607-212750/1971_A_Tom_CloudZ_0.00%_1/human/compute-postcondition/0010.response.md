Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are being printed, where the maximum value is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value is [min(a, b)]**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be integers between 0 and 9, which are read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been read to update the values of `a` and `b`. The maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are still being printed, with the maximum value being [max(a, b)] and the minimum value being [min(a, b)].
