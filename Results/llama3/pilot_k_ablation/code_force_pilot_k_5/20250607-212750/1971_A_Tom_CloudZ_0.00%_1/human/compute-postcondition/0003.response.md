The `print(max(a, b), min(a, b))` statement will print the maximum and minimum values between the two integers `a` and `b`.

Since `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `b` is also an integer between 0 and 9, the maximum value will be the larger of the two, and the minimum value will be the smaller of the two.

Output: **the maximum value between a and b, the minimum value between a and b (where a and b are integers between 0 and 9)**
