The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 4 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is [min(a, b)] are being printed, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and this is printed: the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is [min(a, b)]**
