Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are being printed**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b` are still valid as specified in the initial state. However, the stdin now contains `t-3` lines instead of `t-2` lines, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are being printed, but their exact values are not specified.
