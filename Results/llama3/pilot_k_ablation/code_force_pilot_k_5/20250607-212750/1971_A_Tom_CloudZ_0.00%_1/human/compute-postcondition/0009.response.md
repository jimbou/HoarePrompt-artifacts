To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The states of `a`, `b`, and `stdin` are not modified by the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are being printed, where the maximum value is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value is [min(a, b)]**
