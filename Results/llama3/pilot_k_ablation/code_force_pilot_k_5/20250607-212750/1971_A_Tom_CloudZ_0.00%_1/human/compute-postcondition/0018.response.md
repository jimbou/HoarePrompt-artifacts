Output State: **`t` is an integer between 4 and 100 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is [min(a, b)] are being printed, stdin contains `t-6` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and this is printed: the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is [max(a, b)] and the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is [min(a, b)]**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b` are updated. `a` and `b` are now integers between 0 and 9, which are read from the input. The maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are still being printed. The stdin now contains `t-6` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), because one line has been read to assign values to `a` and `b`.
