Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of negative signs in the input string and then calculating the absolute difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of negative signs. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the optimal way to split the array is to group all the positive signs together and all the negative signs together. The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the number of positive and negative signs is equal, in which case the penalty is equal to the length of the string.
