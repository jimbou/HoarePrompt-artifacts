Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '-' characters in the string and calculating the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of '-' characters. If the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string, it simply prints the length of the string.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. By counting the number of '-' characters, the program is effectively calculating the sum of the array, and then multiplying it by the length of the array (which is n). The absolute value is taken to ensure that the penalty is always non-negative.

The program's handling of the case where the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string is also correct. In this case, the sum of the array is -n, and the penalty is therefore n.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
