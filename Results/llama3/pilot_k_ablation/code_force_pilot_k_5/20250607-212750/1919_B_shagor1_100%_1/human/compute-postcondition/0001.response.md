To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Since `n` is the length of `s` and is between 1 and 5000 inclusive, we can conclude that `s` must have at least one character.

Before the loop starts, `neg` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, which is also not relevant to the loop execution.

So, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` is the first character in the string `s`.
* `s` must have at least one character.

The other states (`n`, `neg`, and `stdin`) do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least one character, `neg` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**
