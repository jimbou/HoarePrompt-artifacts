Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters, neg is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The second line reads a string of length `n` from stdin and assigns it to `s`, so `s` becomes a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters. The third line initializes `neg` to 0. After the execution of the code, `n` and `s` have new values, `neg` is initialized, and stdin contains one less test case.
