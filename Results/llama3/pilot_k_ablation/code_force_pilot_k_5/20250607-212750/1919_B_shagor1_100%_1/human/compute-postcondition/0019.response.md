The code prints the absolute difference between the value of `n` and twice the number of '-' characters in the initial string `s` if `n` is not equal to the number of '-' characters in `s`, otherwise it prints the value of `n`. Where `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is an empty string, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the initial string `s`.
Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is an empty string, neg is the number of '-' characters in the initial string s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the absolute difference between the value of `n` and twice the number of '-' characters in the initial string `s` if `n` is not equal to the number of '-' characters in `s`, otherwise the value of `n`.**
