Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least two characters, `neg` is either 2 or 3 depending on the next character of the string `s`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3 depending on the next character of the string `s`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases.
