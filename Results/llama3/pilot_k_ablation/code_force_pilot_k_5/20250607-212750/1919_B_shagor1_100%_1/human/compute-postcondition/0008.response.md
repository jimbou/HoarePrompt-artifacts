The only variable in the loop head is variable  `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least two characters the loop executes again for the second character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least two characters, `neg` is either 1 or 2 depending on the first character of the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least two characters. The first character is already processed, so the string `s` must have at least one more character. Also, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, so it must have at least one more test case.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least one character, `neg` is either 1 or 2 depending on the second character of the string `s`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases**
