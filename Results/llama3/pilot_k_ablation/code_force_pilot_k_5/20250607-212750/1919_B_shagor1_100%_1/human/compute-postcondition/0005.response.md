The only variable in the loop head is variable `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least one character. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least two characters.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least two characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the first character `i` of the string `s` is '-', then `neg` is 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains unchanged.**
