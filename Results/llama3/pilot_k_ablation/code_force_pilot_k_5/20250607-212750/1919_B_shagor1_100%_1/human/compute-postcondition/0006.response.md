Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least two characters, `neg` is either 1 or 2 depending on the first character of the string `s`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of the string `s` is '-', then `neg` is now 2. Otherwise, `neg` is now 1. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is still one less than before.
