Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least two characters, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `neg` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the next character of the string `s`**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2, 3, or 4, depending on the next character of the string `s`. The other variables, `n`, `s`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
