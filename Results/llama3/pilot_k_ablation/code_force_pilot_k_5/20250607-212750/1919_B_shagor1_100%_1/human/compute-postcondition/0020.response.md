Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, consisting of an integer n and a string s of length n containing '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the absolute difference between n and twice the number of '-' characters in s, and prints this value. If the number of '-' characters is equal to n, it simply prints n. The function processes one test case and does not modify the input variables.**
