Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is an empty string, neg is the number of '-' characters in the initial string s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged, the string `s` is empty because all its characters have been processed, the variable `neg` now holds the total count of '-' characters in the original string `s`, and the state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
