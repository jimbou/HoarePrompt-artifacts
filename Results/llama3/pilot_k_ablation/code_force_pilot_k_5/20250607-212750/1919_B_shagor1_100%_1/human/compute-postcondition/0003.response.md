Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least one character, `neg` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the first character `i` of the string `s` is currently '-'**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `neg` being equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still has a length of `n` and consists of "+" and "-" characters, with the first character being "-". The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus one.
