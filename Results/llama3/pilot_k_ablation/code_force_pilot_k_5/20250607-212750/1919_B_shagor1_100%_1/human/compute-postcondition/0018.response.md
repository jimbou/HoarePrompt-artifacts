To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `s` is an empty string.
   - `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the initial string `s`.
   - `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
print(abs(n - 2 * neg) if n != neg else n)
```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `s` is an empty string, `neg` will be 0 because there are no '-' characters in an empty string.
   - The condition `n != neg` will always be true because `n` is a positive integer (between 1 and 5000) and `neg` is 0.
   - Therefore, the expression `abs(n - 2 * neg)` will be evaluated. Since `neg` is 0, this simplifies to `abs(n - 0)` or simply `abs(n)`.
   - Because `n` is a positive integer, `abs(n)` will just be `n`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will output the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.

Output: **n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive)**
