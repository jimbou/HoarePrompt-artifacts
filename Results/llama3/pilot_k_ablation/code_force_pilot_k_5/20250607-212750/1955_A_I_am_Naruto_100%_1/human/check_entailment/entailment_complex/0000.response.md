Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum cost between buying all yogurts at the regular price and buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price, and prints the minimum cost.

The program uses the correct formulas to calculate the minimum cost:

- `s1 = n * a` calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price.
- `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` calculates the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

The program also correctly uses the `min` function to find the minimum cost between `s1` and `s2`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
