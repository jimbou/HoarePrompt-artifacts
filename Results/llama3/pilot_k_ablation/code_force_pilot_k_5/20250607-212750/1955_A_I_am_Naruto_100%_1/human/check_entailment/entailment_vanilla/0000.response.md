Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that iterates over the number of test cases specified in the input.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

4. It calculates two possible costs:
   - `s1`: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
   - `s2`: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion, where the number of pairs of yogurts is `n // 2` (integer division), and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price (`n % 2 * a`).

5. It prints the minimum cost between `s1` and `s2` for each test case.

6. The program correctly handles the cases where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous than buying them at the regular price, as well as the cases where buying all yogurts at the regular price is more advantageous.

7. The program also correctly handles the cases where the number of yogurts is odd, by adding the cost of the remaining yogurt to the cost of the pairs of yogurts bought at the promotion price.

Correctness: **True**
