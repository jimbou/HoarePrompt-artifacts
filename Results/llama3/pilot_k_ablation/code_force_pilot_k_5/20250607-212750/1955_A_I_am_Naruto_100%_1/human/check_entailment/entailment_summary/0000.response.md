Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. It calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (s1 = n * a).
4. It calculates the total cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price (s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a).
5. It prints the minimum of s1 and s2, which represents the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input lines, calculating the minimum cost, and printing the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
