Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (s1) and the cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion (s2), and then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is even and odd. When n is even, the program calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (b * (n // 2)) and adds the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price (n % 2 * a), which is 0 since n is even. When n is odd, the program calculates the cost of buying n-1 yogurts at the promotion price (b * ((n-1) // 2)) and adds the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (a).

The program also correctly handles the case where the promotion price is more expensive than the regular price. In this case, the program will choose the regular price as the minimum cost.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
