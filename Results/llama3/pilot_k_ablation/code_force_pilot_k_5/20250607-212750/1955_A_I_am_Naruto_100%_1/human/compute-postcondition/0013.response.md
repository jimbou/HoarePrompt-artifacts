Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2 plus a times the remainder of n divided by 2, _ is 3, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers n, a, and b. It then assigns these values to the variables n, a, and b, respectively. The variable s1 is calculated as the product of n and a, while s2 is calculated as the product of b and the integer division of n by 2, plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2. The variable _ remains unchanged at 3. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b. The minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed.
