The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 0, int(input()) must be at least 1**
