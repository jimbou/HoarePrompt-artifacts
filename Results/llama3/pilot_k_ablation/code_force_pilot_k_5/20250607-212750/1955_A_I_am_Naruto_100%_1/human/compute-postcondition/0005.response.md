Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2 plus a times the remainder of n divided by 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated based on the input from stdin. The values of `s1` and `s2` have been calculated using the updated values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The number of lines in stdin has decreased by 1, as one line has been read and processed. The minimum value between `s1` and `s2` is being printed, but its value is not explicitly stated in the output state, as it depends on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
