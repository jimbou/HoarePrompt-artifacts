The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `stdin` must contain t lines.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2 plus a times the remainder of n divided by 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed**
