Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2 plus a times the remainder of n divided by 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers n, a, and b. It then assigns these values to the variables n, a, and b, respectively. The variable s1 is calculated as the product of n and a, and s2 is calculated as the product of b and the integer division of n by 2, plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2. The variable _ remains unchanged. The minimum value between s1 and s2 is printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables. After the code executes, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b.
