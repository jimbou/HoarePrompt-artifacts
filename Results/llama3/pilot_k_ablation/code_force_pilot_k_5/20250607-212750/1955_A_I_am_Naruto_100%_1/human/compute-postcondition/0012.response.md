To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range of integers generated by `int(input())`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more integers to read from the input. Since `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers, we can assume that `t` is the total number of lines in the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2, which means that two lines have already been read from the input. To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `_` to 3, indicating that the next line is ready to be read.

Additionally, since each line contains three integers, we can assume that the next line will contain three new integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, we cannot determine the exact values of these integers, so we will not adjust their states.

The state of `stdin` will also change, as one more line will be read from the input. Therefore, `stdin` will contain `t-4` lines.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, and `s2` are not involved in the loop head, so their states will not be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `s1` is an integer equal to `n` times `a`, `s2` is an integer equal to `b` times the integer division of `n` by 2 plus `a` times the remainder of `n` divided by 2, `_` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30), and the minimum of `s1` and `s2` is being printed**
