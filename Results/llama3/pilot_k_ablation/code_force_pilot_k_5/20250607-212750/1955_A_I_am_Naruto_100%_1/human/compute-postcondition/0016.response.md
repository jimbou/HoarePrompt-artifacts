State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `s1` is an integer equal to `n` times `a`, `s2` is an integer equal to `b` times the integer division of `n` by 2 plus `a` times the remainder of `n` divided by 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30), and the minimum of `s1` and `s2` is being printed**
