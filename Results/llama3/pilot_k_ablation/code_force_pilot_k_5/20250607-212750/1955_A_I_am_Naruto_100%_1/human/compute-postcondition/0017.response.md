Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2 plus a times the remainder of n divided by 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-7 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed**

The code reads three integers from the input, assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`, and calculates `s1` and `s2` based on these values. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the newly read values, while `_` remains unchanged. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed. The minimum of `s1` and `s2` is being printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables.
