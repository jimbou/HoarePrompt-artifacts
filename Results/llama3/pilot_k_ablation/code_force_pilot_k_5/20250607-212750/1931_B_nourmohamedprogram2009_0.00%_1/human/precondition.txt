stdin contains t+2t lines, where t is a positive integer. The first line contains the integer t. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9), where the sum of a_i is divisible by n and does not exceed 2*10^9. The sum of n over all blocks does not exceed 2*10^5.
