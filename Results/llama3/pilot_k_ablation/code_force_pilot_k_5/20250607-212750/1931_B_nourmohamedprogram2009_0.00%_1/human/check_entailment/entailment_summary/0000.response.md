Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program only checks if the input integers are in non-decreasing order, which is not the correct condition for solving the problem.

The correct condition is that the sum of the water in the containers should be divisible by the number of containers, and it should be possible to redistribute the water from the left containers to the right containers to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The program does not check this condition and instead relies solely on the non-decreasing order of the input integers, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
