Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires that the amount of water in all containers can be made the same using the described operation, which involves pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j. However, the program only checks if the array is in non-decreasing order after sorting, which is not sufficient to determine if the operation can be performed.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in each container and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j.

Correctness: **False**
