Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the array of water amounts and then checking if each element is less than or equal to the next one. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem statement allows pouring water from one container to another as long as the source container has a lower index than the destination container. This means that the program should check if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from containers with lower indices to containers with higher indices.

The program's current approach does not take this into account. It simply checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

A correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water per container and then check if it's possible to make all containers have this average amount by pouring water from containers with lower indices to containers with higher indices.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
