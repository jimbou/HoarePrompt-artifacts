Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the array and then checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one. However, this approach does not take into account the actual problem constraints.

The problem states that we can pour water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i < j. This means that we can only pour water from a container to a container that is to its right. The program's approach does not consider this constraint.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "NO", but the correct answer is "NO". We cannot make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation because we cannot pour water from the third container to the first or second container.

A correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in each container and then check if we can make the amount of water in each container equal to the average by pouring water from one container to another.
