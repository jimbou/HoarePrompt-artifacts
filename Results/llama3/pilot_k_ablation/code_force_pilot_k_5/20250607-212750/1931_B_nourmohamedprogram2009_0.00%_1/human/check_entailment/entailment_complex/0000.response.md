Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `arr`.
3.  It sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
4.  It checks if all elements in the sorted array are in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with its next element using the `all` function and a generator expression.
5.  If all elements are in non-decreasing order, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct because:

*   The problem statement guarantees that the sum of the amounts of water in each container is divisible by the number of containers `n`. This means that the average amount of water in each container is an integer.
*   By sorting the array, the program ensures that the containers with the least amount of water are considered first.
*   By checking if all elements are in non-decreasing order, the program effectively checks if it is possible to pour water from one container to the next to make the amounts equal.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Correctness: **True**
