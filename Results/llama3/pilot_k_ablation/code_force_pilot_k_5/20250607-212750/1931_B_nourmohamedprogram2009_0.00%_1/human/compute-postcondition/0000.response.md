The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input, which is an integer `t`, to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple inputs, and the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After this line of code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned, and the stdin now contains the remaining inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.**
