Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer equal to the first input, which was read from stdin. The list `arr` is now a sorted list of integers, which was the second input read from stdin and then sorted in ascending order. Stdin is now empty as both inputs have been read.
