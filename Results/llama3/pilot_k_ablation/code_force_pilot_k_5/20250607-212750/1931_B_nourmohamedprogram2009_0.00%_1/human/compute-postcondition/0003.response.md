Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers. The current value of arr is such that all elements are in non-decreasing order, i.e., for every pair of adjacent elements arr[i] and arr[i + 1], arr[i] is less than or equal to arr[i + 1].**
