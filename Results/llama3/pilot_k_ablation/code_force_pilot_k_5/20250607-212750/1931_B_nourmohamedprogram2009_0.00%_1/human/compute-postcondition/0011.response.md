Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the first input from stdin, which is an integer. The value of `arr` is updated to be a sorted list of integers equal to the second input from stdin. The sorting is done in ascending order.
