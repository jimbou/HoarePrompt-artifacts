To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input. If the list arr is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**
