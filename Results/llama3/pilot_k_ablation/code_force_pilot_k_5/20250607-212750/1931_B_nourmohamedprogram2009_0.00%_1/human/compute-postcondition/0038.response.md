Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, the variable n will be an integer, the list arr will be sorted in ascending order, and the standard input (stdin) will be empty. The loop will print 'YES' if all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, and 'NO' otherwise.
