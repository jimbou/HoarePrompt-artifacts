Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the value of `t`, so it remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 2. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`, and since stdin is empty, `arr` becomes an empty list. The third line sorts `arr` in ascending order, but since `arr` is empty, it remains empty. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
