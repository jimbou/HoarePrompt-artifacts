The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty.**
