Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers**

The code snippet first assigns an integer value from the input to `n`, then assigns a list of integers from the input to `arr`, and finally sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The input is consumed by the `input()` function, so the input state is not included in the output state.
