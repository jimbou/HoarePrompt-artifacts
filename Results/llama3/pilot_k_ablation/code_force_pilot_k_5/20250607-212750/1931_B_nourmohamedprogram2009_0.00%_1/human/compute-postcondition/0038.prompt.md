Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers. If all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input. If the list arr is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If the list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 1, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If all elements in arr are sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
