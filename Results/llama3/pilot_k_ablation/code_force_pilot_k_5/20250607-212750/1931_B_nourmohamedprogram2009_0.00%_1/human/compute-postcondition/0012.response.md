Based on the initial state, the variable `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. It will always print the string 'YES', regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
