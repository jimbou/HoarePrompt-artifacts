Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to 1 plus the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t at index i, b is equal to 1 plus the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t at index i, i is 1, stdin contains t-n-1-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `a` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the character at index `i` in string `t`, and the value of `b` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is less than the character at index `i` in string `t`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unaffected.
