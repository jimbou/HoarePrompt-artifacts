The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `s` is a string of `n` characters, `t` is a string of `n` characters, `a` is equal to 1 if the character at index 1 in string `s` is greater than the character at index 1 in string `t` or the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the character at index `i` in string `t` or the character at index 2 in string `s` is greater than the character at index 2 in string `t`, otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is equal to 1 if the character at index 1 in string `s` is less than the character at index 1 in string `t` or the character at index `i` in string `s` is less than the character at index `i` in string `t` or the character at index 2 in string `s` is less than the character at index 2 in string `t`, otherwise `b` is 0, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-n-1-2` test cases.**
