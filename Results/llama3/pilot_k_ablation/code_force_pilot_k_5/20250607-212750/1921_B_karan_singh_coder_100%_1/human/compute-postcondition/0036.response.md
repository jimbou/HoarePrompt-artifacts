To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters, `t` is a string of `n` characters, `a` is equal to 1 plus the number of characters in `s` that are greater than the corresponding characters in `t` at index `i`, `b` is equal to 1 plus the number of characters in `s` that are less than the corresponding characters in `t` at index `i`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-1-3` test cases**
