The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', `t` is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', `a` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is greater than the character in t at position i, `b` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is less than the character in t at position i, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
