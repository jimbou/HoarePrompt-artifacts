To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop condition is `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the standard input.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0
* `s` is a string of `n` characters
* `t` is a string of `n` characters
* `a` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that are greater than the corresponding characters in `t`
* `b` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that are less than the corresponding characters in `t`
* `i` is `n`
* `stdin` contains `t-n-1-3` test cases
* The maximum of `a` and `b` is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. The only variable that changes is the loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop condition `int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input, which means that the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string of `n` characters, `t` is a string of `n` characters, `a` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that are greater than the corresponding characters in `t`, `b` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that are less than the corresponding characters in `t`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-n-1-2` test cases, and the maximum of `a` and `b` is being printed**
