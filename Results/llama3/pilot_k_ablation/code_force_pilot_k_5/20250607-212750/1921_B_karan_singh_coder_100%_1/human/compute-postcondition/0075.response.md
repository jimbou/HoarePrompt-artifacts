Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t, i is n, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the maximum of a and b is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of n is still an integer greater than or equal to 0, the strings s and t still have n characters, the variables a and b still hold the counts of positions where the characters in s are greater than or less than the characters in t respectively, the loop counter i has reached the value of n, and there are no more test cases left in the input (stdin contains 0 test cases). The maximum of a and b is being printed as the final output.
