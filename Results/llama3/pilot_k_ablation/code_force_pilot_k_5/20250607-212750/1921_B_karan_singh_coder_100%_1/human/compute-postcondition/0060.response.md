To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more test case in the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-n-1-2` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string of `n` characters, `t` is a string of `n` characters, `a` is equal to the number of characters in string `s` that are greater than the corresponding characters in string `t`, `b` is equal to the number of characters in string `s` that are less than the corresponding characters in string `t`, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-n-1-1` test cases, and the maximum value between `a` and `b` is printed**
