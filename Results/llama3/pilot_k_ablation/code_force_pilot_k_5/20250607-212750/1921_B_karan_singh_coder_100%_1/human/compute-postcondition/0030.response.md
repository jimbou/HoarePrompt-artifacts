To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` (a throwaway variable), `int(input())`, and `stdin` (the standard input).

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to contain `t-n-1` test cases.

The other objects in the loop head, `_` and `int(input())`, are not relevant to the state of the program, as `_` is a throwaway variable and `int(input())` is an expression that is evaluated at each iteration.

The state of the other variables, `n`, `s`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, is not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `t` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `a` is the number of positions where the character in `s` is greater than the character in `t` at the same position, `b` is the number of positions where the character in `s` is less than the character in `t` at the same position, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-n-1` test cases, and the maximum of `a` and `b` is being printed**
