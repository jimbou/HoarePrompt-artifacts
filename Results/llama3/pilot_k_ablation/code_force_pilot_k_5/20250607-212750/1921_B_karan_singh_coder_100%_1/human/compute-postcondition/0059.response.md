The code prints the maximum value between `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of characters in string `s` that are greater than the corresponding characters in string `t`, and `b` is the number of characters in string `s` that are less than the corresponding characters in string `t`.
Output: **n is greater than or equal to 0, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in string s that are greater than the corresponding characters in string t, b is equal to the number of characters in string s that are less than the corresponding characters in string t, i is n-1, stdin contains t-n-1-2 test cases, and the maximum value between a and b is printed**
