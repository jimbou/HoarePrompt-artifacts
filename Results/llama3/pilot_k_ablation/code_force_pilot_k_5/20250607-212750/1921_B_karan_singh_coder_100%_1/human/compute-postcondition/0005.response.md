Output State: **n is at least 1, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is greater than the character in t at position i, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is less than the character in t at position i, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `a` is incremented by 1 if the character in `s` at position `i` is greater than the character in `t` at the same position, and the value of `b` is incremented by 1 if the character in `s` at position `i` is less than the character in `t` at the same position. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1 as one test case has been processed.
