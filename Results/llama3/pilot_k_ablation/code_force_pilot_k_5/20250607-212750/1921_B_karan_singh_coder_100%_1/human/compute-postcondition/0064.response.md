The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t, i is 2, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases.**
