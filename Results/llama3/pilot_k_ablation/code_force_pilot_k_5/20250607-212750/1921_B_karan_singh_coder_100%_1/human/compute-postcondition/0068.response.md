State: **n is an integer greater than 3, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is greater than t[2] and s[3] is greater than t[3] otherwise a remains the same, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is less than t[2] and s[3] is less than t[3] otherwise b remains the same, i is 4, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases**
