The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is greater than 2, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to 1 if the character at index 1 in string s is greater than the character at index 1 in string t or the character at index i in string s is greater than the character at index i in string t, otherwise a is 0, b is equal to 1 if the character at index 1 in string s is less than the character at index 1 in string t or the character at index i in string s is less than the character at index i in string t, otherwise b is 0, i is 2, stdin contains t-n-1-2 test cases.**
