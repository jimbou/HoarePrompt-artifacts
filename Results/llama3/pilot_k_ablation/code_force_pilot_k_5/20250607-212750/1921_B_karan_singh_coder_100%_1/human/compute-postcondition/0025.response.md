The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position plus the result of s[3] > t[3] plus the result of s[3] > t[3], b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position plus the result of s[3] < t[3] plus the result of s[3] < t[3], i is 4, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases**
