Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0, b is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a += s[i] > t[i]
    b += s[i] < t[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 1, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 1, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is greater than the character in t at position i, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is less than the character in t at position i, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 2, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is greater than the character in t at position i, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is less than the character in t at position i, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is at least 3, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position 3 is greater than the character in t at position 3, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position 3 is less than the character in t at position 3, i is 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is at least 4, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position 3 is greater than the character in t at position 3, plus whether the character in s at position 4 is greater than the character in t at position 4, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position 3 is less than the character in t at position 3, plus whether the character in s at position 4 is less than the character in t at position 4, i is 4, stdin contains t-5 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
