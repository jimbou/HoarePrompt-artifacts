State: **n is greater than 4, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to 1 if the character at index 1 in string s is greater than the character at index 1 in string t or the character at index 4 in string s is greater than the character at index 4 in string t or the character at index 2 in string s is greater than the character at index 2 in string t or the character at index 3 in string s is greater than the character at index 3 in string t, otherwise a is 0, b is equal to 1 if the character at index 1 in string s is less than the character at index 1 in string t or the character at index 4 in string s is less than the character at index 4 in string t or the character at index 2 in string s is less than the character at index 2 in string t or the character at index 3 in string s is less than the character at index 3 in string t, otherwise b is 0, i is 4, stdin contains t-n-1-2 test cases.**
