The code prints the maximum value between the number of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the character in string `t` at the same position (`a`), and the number of positions where the character in string `s` is less than the character in string `t` at the same position (`b`).

Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, and b is the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position)**
