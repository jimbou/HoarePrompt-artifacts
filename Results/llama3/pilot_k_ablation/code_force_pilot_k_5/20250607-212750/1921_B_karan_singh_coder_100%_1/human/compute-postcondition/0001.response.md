Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0, b is 0**

In this output state, the code has read the first test case from stdin, which contains an integer n, a string s of n characters, and a string t of n characters. The variables n, s, and t have been assigned the values from the first test case. The variables a and b have been initialized to 0. The remaining t-1 test cases are still in stdin.
