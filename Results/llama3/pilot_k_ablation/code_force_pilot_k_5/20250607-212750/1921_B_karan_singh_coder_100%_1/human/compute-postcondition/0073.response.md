The code prints the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Where `a` is the number of characters in string `s` that are greater than the corresponding characters in string `t`, and `b` is the number of characters in string `s` that are less than the corresponding characters in string `t`.

Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the number of characters in s greater than the corresponding characters in t, and b is the number of characters in s less than the corresponding characters in t)**
