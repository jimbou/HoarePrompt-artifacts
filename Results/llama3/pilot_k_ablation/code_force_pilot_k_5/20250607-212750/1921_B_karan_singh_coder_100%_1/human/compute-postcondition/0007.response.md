Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is greater than the character in t at position i, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position i is less than the character in t at position i, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `a` by 1 if the character in `s` at position `i` is greater than the character in `t` at position `i`, and increments the value of `b` by 1 if the character in `s` at position `i` is less than the character in `t` at position `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
