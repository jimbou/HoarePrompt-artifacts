Output State: **n is at least n, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, b is the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, i is n-1, stdin contains t-n test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of 'n' remains the same, the strings 's' and 't' remain unchanged, the variable 'a' now holds the total count of positions where the character in 's' is greater than the character in 't', the variable 'b' now holds the total count of positions where the character in 's' is less than the character in 't', the loop counter 'i' has reached 'n-1', and there are 't-n' test cases left in the input.
