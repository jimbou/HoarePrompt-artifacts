To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `t` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `a` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in `s` is greater than the character in `t` at the same position, `b` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in `s` is less than the character in `t` at the same position, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases**
