Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t, i is n, stdin contains t-n-1-3 test cases**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'a' will hold the count of characters in string 's' that are greater than the corresponding characters in string 't', and the variable 'b' will hold the count of characters in string 's' that are less than the corresponding characters in string 't'. The variable 'i' will be equal to 'n', which is the length of the strings 's' and 't'. The other variables 'n', 's', 't', and the contents of 'stdin' remain unchanged.
