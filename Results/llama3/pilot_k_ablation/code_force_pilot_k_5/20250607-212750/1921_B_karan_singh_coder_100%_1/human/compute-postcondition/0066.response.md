The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is greater than t[2] otherwise a remains the same, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is less than t[2] otherwise b remains the same, i is 3, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases.**
