Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n, the second line contains a string s of n characters, and the third line contains a string f of n characters. The characters in s and f are either '0' or '1'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    a = b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a += s[i] > t[i]
        b += s[i] < t[i]
    print(max(a, b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least n, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, b is the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, i is n-1, stdin contains t-n test cases, and the maximum of a and b is printed, where a is the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, and b is the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, b is the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, i is n-1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, and the maximum of a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t, i is n, stdin contains t-n-1-3 test cases, and the maximum of a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is greater than or equal to 0, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in string s that are greater than the corresponding characters in string t, b is equal to the number of characters in string s that are less than the corresponding characters in string t, i is n-1, stdin contains t-n-1-2 test cases, and the maximum value between a and b is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t, i is n, stdin contains t-n test cases, and the maximum of a and b is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
