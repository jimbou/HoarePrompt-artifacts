Output State: **n is at least 4, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position 3 is greater than the character in t at position 3, plus whether the character in s at position 4 is greater than the character in t at position 4, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position, plus whether the character in s at position 3 is less than the character in t at position 3, plus whether the character in s at position 4 is less than the character in t at position 4, i is 4, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `a` by 1 if the character in `s` at position `i` (which is 4) is greater than the character in `t` at the same position, and increments the value of `b` by 1 if the character in `s` at position `i` (which is 4) is less than the character in `t` at the same position. The values of `n`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
