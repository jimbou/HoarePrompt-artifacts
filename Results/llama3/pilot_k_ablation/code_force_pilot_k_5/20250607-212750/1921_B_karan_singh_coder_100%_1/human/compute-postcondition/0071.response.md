Output State: **n is an integer greater than 5, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is greater than t[2] and s[3] is greater than t[3] and s[4] is greater than t[4] and s[5] is greater than t[5], otherwise a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t plus 1, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is less than t[2] and s[3] is less than t[3] and s[4] is less than t[4] and s[5] is less than t[5], otherwise b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t plus 1, i is 5, stdin contains t-n-5 test cases**
