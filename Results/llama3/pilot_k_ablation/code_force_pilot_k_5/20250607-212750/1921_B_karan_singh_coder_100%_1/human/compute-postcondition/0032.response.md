The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer read from input, `s` is a string of `n` characters read from input, `t` is a string of `n` characters read from input, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains `t-n-1-3` test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer read from input that must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of `n` characters read from input, `t` is a string of `n` characters read from input, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-n-1-3` test cases**
