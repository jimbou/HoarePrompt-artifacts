The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t at the same position plus the result of s[i] > t[i], b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t at the same position plus the result of s[i] < t[i], i is 2, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases.**
