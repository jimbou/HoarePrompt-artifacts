The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **n is an integer greater than 5, s is a string of n characters, t is a string of n characters, a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is greater than t[2] and s[3] is greater than t[3] and s[4] is greater than t[4], otherwise a is equal to the number of characters in s that are greater than the corresponding characters in t, b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t plus 1 if s[2] is less than t[2] and s[3] is less than t[3] and s[4] is less than t[4], otherwise b is equal to the number of characters in s that are less than the corresponding characters in t, i is 5, stdin contains t-n-5 test cases**
