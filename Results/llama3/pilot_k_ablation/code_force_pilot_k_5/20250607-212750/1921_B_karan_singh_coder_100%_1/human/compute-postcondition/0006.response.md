The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `t` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `a` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in `s` is greater than the character in `t` at the same position, plus whether the character in `s` at position `i` is greater than the character in `t` at position `i`, `b` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in `s` is less than the character in `t` at the same position, plus whether the character in `s` at position `i` is less than the character in `t` at position `i`, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**
