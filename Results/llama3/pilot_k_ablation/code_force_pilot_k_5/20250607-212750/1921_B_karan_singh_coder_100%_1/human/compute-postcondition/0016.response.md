Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', t is a string of n characters consisting of '0' and '1', a is 0, b is 0, i is not defined, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer read from the input, `s` and `t` are strings of `n` characters each, consisting of '0' and '1', `a` and `b` are initialized to 0, and `i` is not defined because it was not assigned a value in the given code snippet. The stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases because three inputs were read: `n`, `s`, and `t`.
