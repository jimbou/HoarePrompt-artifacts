According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is at least 1, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `t` is a string of `n` characters consisting of '0' and '1', `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0**
