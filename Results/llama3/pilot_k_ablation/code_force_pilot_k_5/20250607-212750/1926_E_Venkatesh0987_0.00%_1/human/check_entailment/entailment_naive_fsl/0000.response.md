Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement. It first checks if the k-th card is among the odd-numbered cards, and if so, it prints the corresponding odd number. If not, it calculates the number of cards that are twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on, until it finds the range where the k-th card falls. It then calculates the actual card number based on the range and the position within that range.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where k is 1 or n. The use of the while loops to calculate the number of cards in each range and the final card number is correct and efficient.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
