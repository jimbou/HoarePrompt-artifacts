Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the k-th card laid down by Vladislav in a specific order. The program iterates through the input pairs of integers n and k, where n represents the number of cards and k represents the position of the card to be found.

The program first checks if k is greater than (n + 1) // 2. If it is, the program enters a while loop that calculates the number of cards laid down in each iteration, updating the values of s, d, and i accordingly. Once the loop exits, the program calculates the value of g and then calculates the k-th card using the formula 2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g).

If k is not greater than (n + 1) // 2, the program simply prints 2 * k - 1 as the k-th card.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The use of while loops and conditional statements ensures that the program handles different cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
