Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is equal to (n+1)//2, p is 2, g is equal to (n+1)//2, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `h` is updated to `(n+1)//2` due to the subtraction of `(h+1)//2` from its original value `n`. The value of `p` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `g` is updated to `(n+1)//2` by adding `(h+1)//2` to its original value 0. Stdin still contains `t-2` pairs of integers as the code does not modify it.
