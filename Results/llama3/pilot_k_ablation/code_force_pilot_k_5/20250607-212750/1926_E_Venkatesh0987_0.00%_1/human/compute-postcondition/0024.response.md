Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is equal to i + 1, g is equal to n, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `h` will be 0, the value of `p` will be one more than the number of times the loop executed (`i + 1`), and the value of `g` will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
