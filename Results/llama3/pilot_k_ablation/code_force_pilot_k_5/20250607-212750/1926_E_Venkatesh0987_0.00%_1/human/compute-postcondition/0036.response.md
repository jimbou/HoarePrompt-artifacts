According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `k`, and `d`. If `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `(d + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer greater than 0, and `d` is equal to `d - (d + 1) // 2`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `d` so that it is greater than 0 after the subtraction. This means the original value of `d` must be greater than `(d + 1) // 2`. Also, since `s` is equal to `(d + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `(d + 1) // 2` is less than `k`. Therefore, `d` must be less than `2 * k - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is equal to `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `d` is greater than `(d + 1) // 2` and less than `2 * k - 1`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 2` pairs of integers**
