The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 3, i is at least 3. p being 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to p is less than or equal to i - 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is k, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i - 2, g is g + (n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2**
