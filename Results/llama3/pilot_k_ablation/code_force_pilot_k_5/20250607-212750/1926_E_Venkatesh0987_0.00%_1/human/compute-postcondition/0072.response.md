Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4, s is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4 + (d + 1) // 2, i is 4, d is greater than 0 and less than or equal to (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` is incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, and the value of `d` is reduced by `(d + 1) // 2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
