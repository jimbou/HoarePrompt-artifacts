Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4, s is (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4 + ((n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4 + 1) // 2, i is 3, d is ((n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4 - ((n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4 + 1) // 2), h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2**

The code modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by half of `d + 1`, which is equivalent to adding the ceiling of `(d + 1) / 2` to `s`. The second line decrements `d` by half of `d + 1`, which is equivalent to subtracting the ceiling of `(d + 1) / 2` from `d`. The third line increments `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
