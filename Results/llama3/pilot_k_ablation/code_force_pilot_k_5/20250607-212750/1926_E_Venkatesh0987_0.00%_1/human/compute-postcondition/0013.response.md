Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is equal to the number of times the loop executed, d is 0, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable s is equal to n, the variable i is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and the variable d is 0. The values of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
