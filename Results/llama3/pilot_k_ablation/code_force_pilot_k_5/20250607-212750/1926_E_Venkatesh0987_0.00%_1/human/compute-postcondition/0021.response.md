Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 5, d is 0, h is equal to n - ceil(n/2) - (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2, g is equal to ceil(n/2) + (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, p is 5, t is at least 1, and _ is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `p` is incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `h` is decremented by `(h + 1) // 2`, and the value of `g` is incremented by `(h + 1) // 2`. The stdin remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
