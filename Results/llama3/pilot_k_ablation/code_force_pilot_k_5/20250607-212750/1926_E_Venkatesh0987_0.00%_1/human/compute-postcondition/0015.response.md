Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is 0, d is 0, h is equal to n - ceil(n/2), p is 2, g is equal to ceil(n/2), stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0**

The code block modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the ceiling of `n/2`, which is equivalent to `(h + 1) // 2`. The second line decrements `h` by the same value, effectively setting it to `n - ceil(n/2)`. The third line simply increments `p` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
