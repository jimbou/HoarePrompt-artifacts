Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is equal to k, i is greater than or equal to i, d is 0, g is increased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, h is decreased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, p is equal to i, f is equal to k - g, and y is equal to 2, and the value of y which is 2 is being printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then this is printed: 2 times k minus 1.***
