Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 6, d is 0, h is equal to n - ceil(n/2) - (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2, g is equal to ceil(n/2) + (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, p is 6, t is at least 1, and _ is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by `(h + 1) // 2`, which is a positive integer. The second line decrements `h` by `(h + 1) // 2`, which is also a positive integer. The third line increments `p` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
