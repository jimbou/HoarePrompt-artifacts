Output State: **t pairs of integers have been processed, and the corresponding output values have been printed. The loop variables _ is equal to t, n and k are the last pair of integers from stdin, s, i, d, h, p, g are integers, and the output values are either 2 * k - 1 or 2^(i-1) * (k - g) depending on whether k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or greater than (n + 1) // 2, respectively.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all the iterations, and the corresponding output values have been printed for each pair of integers from the input. The loop variables have been updated accordingly, and the final values of n and k are the last pair of integers from the input. The output values are either 2 * k - 1 or 2^(i-1) * (k - g), depending on whether k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or greater than (n + 1) // 2, respectively.
