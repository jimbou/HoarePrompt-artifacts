According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, and `i` is at least 3. Since `p` is already less than or equal to `i - 1`, we don't need to adjust `p`. However, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 4, so that `i - 1` is at least 3, which is greater than the current value of `p`.

State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is k, i is at least 4, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i - 1, g is g + (n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2**
