Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is equal to (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2, i is 2, d is greater than (d + 1) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2 and less than 2 * k - 1 - (d + 1) // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` is updated by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its initial value, which was `(d + 1) // 2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `d` is updated by subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from its initial value, which was greater than `(d + 1) // 2` and less than `2 * k - 1`. The stdin remains unchanged as it is not accessed or modified by the code.
