To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `s` is equal to `k`
- `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executes
- `d` is 0
- Other variables remain unchanged

The loop condition involves `p` and `i`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be true.

Since `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executes, and we want the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 1. However, the condition also involves `i - 1`, meaning `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, considering `p` could be 1 at minimum for the condition to hold true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is at least 2. The other variables (`s`, `d`, and the relationship between `s` and `k`) do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`s` is equal to `k`, `i` must be at least 2, `d` is 0**
