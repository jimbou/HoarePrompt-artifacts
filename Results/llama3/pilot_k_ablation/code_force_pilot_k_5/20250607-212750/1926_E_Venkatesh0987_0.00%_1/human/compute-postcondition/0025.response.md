Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is equal to i + 1, g is equal to n, f is equal to k - n, y is equal to 2^(i-1) * (k - n), stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0.**

The code executes two lines, each affecting different variables. The first line assigns the value of `k - g` to `f`. Since `g` is equal to `n`, `f` becomes `k - n`. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * f` to `y`. Since `f` is `k - n`, `y` becomes `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - n)`. No other variables are affected by the code.
