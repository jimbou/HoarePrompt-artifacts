The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 3, i is greater than 2. i being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 4, d is 0, h is 0, p is 3, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4, _ is 2**
