Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 4, d is 0, h is -1, p is 4, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + 0, _ is 2**

In the final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `h` is decremented by half of its original value plus one, resulting in a value of -1. The value of `p` is incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `g` is incremented by half of the original value of `h` plus one, which is 0, so its value remains `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4`.
