The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 5 and i is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, p must be less than or equal to i - 1, so i must be at least 6.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, i is at least 6, d is 0, h is -1, p is 5, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + 0, _ is 2**
