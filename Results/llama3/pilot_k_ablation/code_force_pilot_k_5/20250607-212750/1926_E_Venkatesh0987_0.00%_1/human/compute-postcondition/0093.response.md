Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is 2. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is less than or equal to k, d is 0, h is -1, p is i, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + ... + 0, and the value of 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is printed.***
