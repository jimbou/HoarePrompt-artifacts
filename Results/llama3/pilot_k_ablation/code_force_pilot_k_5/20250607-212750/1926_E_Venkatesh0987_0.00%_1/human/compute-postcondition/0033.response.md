The code snippet provided assigns new values to the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g`. Here's the combined effect of all the lines on the program:

- `n, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads a pair of integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `n` and `k` were initially integers between 1 and 10^9 and between 1 and `n`, respectively, their values are updated to the newly read integers. Stdin now contains `t - 2` pairs of integers.

- `s = 0`, `i = 0`, `d = n`, `h = n`, `p = 1`, `g = 0`: These lines assign new values to the variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g`. The variables `s`, `i`, and `g` are set to 0, while `d` and `h` are set to the value of `n`, and `p` is set to 1.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` is an integer (its value is updated from the input)
- `k` is an integer (its value is updated from the input)
- `s` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `d` is equal to the updated value of `n`
- `h` is equal to the updated value of `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `_` is still 1 (since it was not modified by the code)
- Stdin contains `t - 2` pairs of integers

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is equal to n, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**
