The first line increments `s` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`. Since `d` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `(d + 1) // 2` is `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n + 1) // 4`. So, `s` becomes `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4`. The second line decrements `d` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`, making `d` equal to `(n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 2. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, s is (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4, i is 2, d is (n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2**
