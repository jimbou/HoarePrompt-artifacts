To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `p` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is currently 1, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure that `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2.

State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer from stdin, s is k, i is at least 2, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**
