To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `s` is less than or equal to `k`
- `i` is the number of times the loop executes
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `_` is 2

The loop condition involves `p` and `i`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be true.

Since `p` is 1, for `p <= i - 1` to be true, `i` must be at least 2. This is because if `i` were 1, `i - 1` would be 0, and 1 is not less than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 2**
