Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, s is 0, i is 0, d is equal to n, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while s < k and d > 0:
    s += (d + 1) // 2
    d -= (d + 1) // 2
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is equal to (d + 1) // 2, i is 1, d is equal to d - (d + 1) // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than k, i is 2, d is greater than 0 and d is equal to d // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than k, i is 3, d is greater than 0 and d is at least 1, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: n is an integer greater than 0, k is greater than s, s is less than k and at least its original value plus (d+1)//2, i is 4, d is greater than 0 and at most d//2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: n is an integer greater than 0, k is greater than s, s is at least its original value plus (d+1)//2, i is 5, d is at most (d//2 - 1) - (d+1)//2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
