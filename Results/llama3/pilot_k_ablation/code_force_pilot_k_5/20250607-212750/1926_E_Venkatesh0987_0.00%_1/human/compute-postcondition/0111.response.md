According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is increased by 2 and `i` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `p + 1`. Since `p` is increased by 2, `i` must be greater than 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

State: **`s` is equal to `k`, `i` is greater than 4, `d` is 0, `g` is increased by the original value of `h` plus one, `h` is decreased by the original value of `h` plus one, `p` is increased by 2**
