Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is an integer greater than 0, d is 0, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `s` is less than or equal to `k`, the variable `i` is an integer greater than 0, and the variable `d` is 0. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
