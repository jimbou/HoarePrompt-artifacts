Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 4, d is 0, h is equal to n - ceil(n/2) - (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2, g is equal to ceil(n/2) + (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, p is 4, t is at least 1, and _ is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers**

In this output state, the values of n, k, s, i, d, and t remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of h is decreased by (h + 1) // 2, and the value of g is increased by (h + 1) // 2. The value of p is incremented by 1. The stdin remains unchanged as it is not accessed or modified by the code.
