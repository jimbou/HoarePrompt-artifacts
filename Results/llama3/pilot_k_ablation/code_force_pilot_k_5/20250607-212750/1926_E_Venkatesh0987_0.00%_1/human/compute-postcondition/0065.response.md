To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `s < k and d > 0`.

1. **Condition 1: `s < k`**
   - Right before the loop, `s` is 0, and `k` is an integer.
   - For `s < k` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0 because `s` is 0.

2. **Condition 2: `d > 0`**
   - Right before the loop, `d` is equal to `n`, and `n` is an integer.
   - For `d > 0` to be true, `n` (and thus `d`) must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n` (which affects `d`). The other variables (`s`, `i`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `_`) do not need to be adjusted because their values do not affect the loop's ability to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 2**
