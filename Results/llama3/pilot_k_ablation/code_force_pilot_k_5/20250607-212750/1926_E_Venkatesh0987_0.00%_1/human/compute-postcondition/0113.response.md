According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is increased by 3 and `i` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is increased by 3, `i` must be greater than 4 + 3 = 7. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is equal to `k`, `i` is greater than 7, `d` is 0, `g` is increased by the original value of `h` plus one plus half of the original value of `h` plus one, `h` is decreased by the original value of `h` plus one plus half of the original value of `h` plus one, `p` is increased by 3**
