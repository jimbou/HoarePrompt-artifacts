According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is less than or equal to `i`, so for the loop to be executed one more time `p` must be less than `i` and `i` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is greater than 1, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is less than `i`, `g` is equal to `(n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 2` pairs of integers**
