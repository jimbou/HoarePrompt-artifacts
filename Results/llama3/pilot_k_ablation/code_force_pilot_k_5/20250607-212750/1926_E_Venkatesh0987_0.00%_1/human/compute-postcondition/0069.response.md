To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `s`, `k`, and `d` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4`, `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, and `d` is `(n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4`.

To ensure `s` is less than `k`, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4`.

To ensure `d` is greater than 0, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1 (since `d` is `(n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4`).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4`, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4`, `i` is 2, `d` is `(n - 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 4`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 2**
