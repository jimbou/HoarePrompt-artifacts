Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, i is an integer, d is 0, h is -1, p is i, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + ... + 0, _ is 2, f is k - g, y is 2 ** (i - 1) * f**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `k - g` to `f`. Since `k` is an integer and `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + ... + 0`, `f` becomes an integer equal to `k - g`. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * f` to `y`. Since `i` is an integer and `f` is `k - g`, `y` becomes an integer equal to `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`. No other variables are affected.
