According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `d`. If `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `d` is greater than `(d + 1) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2` and less than `2 * k - 1 - (d + 1) // 2`. `d` being greater than `(d + 1) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `d` is greater than 0. `s` being equal to `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is less than `k`, `i` is 2, `d` is greater than 0 and less than `2 * k - 1 - (d + 1) // 2`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 2` pairs of integers**
