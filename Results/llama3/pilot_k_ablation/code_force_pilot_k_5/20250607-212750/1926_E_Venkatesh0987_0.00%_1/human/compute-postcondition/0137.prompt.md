Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0
Code of the loop:
while s < k and d > 0:
    s += (d + 1) // 2
    d -= (d + 1) // 2
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer from stdin, s is (n+1)/2, i is 1, d is (n-1)/2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs:
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than (n+1)/2, s is n, i is 2, d is (n-1)//2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than k, k is an integer greater than (n+1)/2, s is n + (n-1)//2 // 2, i is 3, d is (n-1)//2 - (n-1)//2 // 2 and greater than 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than k and large enough so that s is less than k and d is greater than 0, k is an integer greater than (n+1)/2, s is n + (n-1)//2 // 2 + (d + 1) // 2, i is 4, d is (n-1)//2 - (n-1)//2 // 2 - (d + 1) // 2 and greater than 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: s is increased by half of the original value of d plus one, d is reduced to half of its original value, i is incremented by 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
