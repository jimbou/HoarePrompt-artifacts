The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 2 and i is 0. For the loop to execute again, i must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is equal to n - ceil(n/2), p is 2, g is equal to ceil(n/2), stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0**
