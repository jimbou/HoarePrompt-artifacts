The code prints the value of `y`, which is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `i-1`, multiplied by the difference between `k` and `n`. 

Since `i` is at least 1, `i-1` will be at least 0. The value of 2 raised to the power of `i-1` will be at least 1.

The difference between `k` and `n` is `k-n`, which is also equal to `f`. Since `f` is equal to `k-n`, we can say that `k-n` is equal to `f`.

Therefore, the value of `y` is 2 raised to the power of `i-1`, multiplied by `f`.

Output: **2^(i-1) * f (where i is at least 1 and f is equal to k - n)**
