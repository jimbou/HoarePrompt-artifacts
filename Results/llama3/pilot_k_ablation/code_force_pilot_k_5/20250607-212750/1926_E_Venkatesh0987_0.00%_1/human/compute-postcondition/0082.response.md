To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop statement: `p <= i - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `s` is less than or equal to `k`
- `i` is greater than 4
- `d` is 0
- `h` is -1
- `p` is 4
- `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + 0`
- `_` is 2

We need to adjust the states of `p` and `i` since they are the variables in the loop head.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be true. Given that `p` is 4, we need `i - 1` to be at least 4, meaning `i` must be at least 5. However, since `i` is already greater than 4, we don't need to adjust `i` further; it already satisfies the condition for the loop to potentially execute again.

However, we need to ensure that `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is 4 and `i` is greater than 4, we need to adjust `p` to be less than or equal to `i - 1`. But since `p` is already at its minimum required value (4) and `i` is greater than 4, we don't necessarily need to adjust `p` to a specific value; it's already in a state that could allow the loop to execute again if `i` is adjusted appropriately.

But to ensure the loop can certainly execute one more time, we should adjust `i` to be at least 5 (since `p` is 4), so the condition `p <= i - 1` is definitely true.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is at least 5, `d` is 0, `h` is -1, `p` is 4, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + 0`, `_` is 2**
