Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is equal to (d + 1) // 2, i is 1, d is equal to d - (d + 1) // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by the integer division of `d + 1` by 2, and the value of `d` has been decremented by the same amount. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
