Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to (d + 1) // 2, i is 1, d is equal to d - (d + 1) // 2 and at least 1, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `d + 1` by 2. The value of `d` has been decremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, resulting in a new value that is at least 1. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
