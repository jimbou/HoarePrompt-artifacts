Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than k and equal to its original value plus (d + 1) // 2, i is 3, d is greater than 0 and less than 2 * k - 1 - (d + 1) // 2 and equal to its original value minus (d + 1) // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `s` is incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, but it is still less than `k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `d` is decremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, but it is still greater than 0 and less than `2 * k - 1 - (d + 1) // 2`. The values of `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged. The contents of `stdin` remain the same, containing `t - 2` pairs of integers.
