According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is increased by 1, `i` is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be greater than 2, so that `i - 1` is greater than `p`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is equal to `k`, `i` is greater than 2, `d` is 0, `g` is increased by half of the original value of `h` plus one, `h` is decreased by half of its original value plus one, `p` is increased by 1**
