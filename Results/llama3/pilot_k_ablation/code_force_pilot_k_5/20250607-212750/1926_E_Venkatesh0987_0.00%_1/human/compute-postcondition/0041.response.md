Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than k and equal to its original value plus (d + 1) // 2, i is 4, d is greater than 0 and less than 2 * k - 1 - (d + 1) // 2 and equal to its original value minus (d + 1) // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

The code modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is the same value that was added to `s` initially, so `s` is now equal to its original value plus `2 * (d + 1) // 2`. The second line decrements `d` by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is the same value that was subtracted from `d` initially, so `d` is now equal to its original value minus `2 * (d + 1) // 2`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
