According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `d`. If `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is `(n+1)/2`, `k` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer from stdin, `d` is `(n-1)/2`, and `n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the first integer from stdin. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be less than `k` and `d` must be greater than 0. Since `s` is `(n+1)/2` and `d` is `(n-1)/2`, `n` must be greater than 1 and `(n+1)/2` must be less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer greater than (n+1)/2 and equal to the second integer from stdin, s is (n+1)/2, i is 1, d is (n-1)/2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**
