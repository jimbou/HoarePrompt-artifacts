To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `p` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, and `i` is at least 3.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `p` is still less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `i` is already at least 3, we can't adjust it further. However, we can adjust `p` to be less than or equal to `i - 2`, which would definitely allow the loop to execute again.

State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is k, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i - 2, g is g + (n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2**
