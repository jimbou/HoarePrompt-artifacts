Output State: **s is equal to k, i is greater than 7, d is 0, g is increased by the original value of h plus one plus half of the original value of h plus one plus half of the original value of h plus one, h is decreased by the original value of h plus one plus half of the original value of h plus one plus half of the original value of h plus one, p is less than or equal to i.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `g` is increased by the original value of `h` plus one plus half of the original value of `h` plus one plus half of the original value of `h` plus one, while the value of `h` is decreased by the original value of `h` plus one plus half of the original value of `h` plus one plus half of the original value of `h` plus one. The value of `p` is incremented by 1, making it less than or equal to `i`.
