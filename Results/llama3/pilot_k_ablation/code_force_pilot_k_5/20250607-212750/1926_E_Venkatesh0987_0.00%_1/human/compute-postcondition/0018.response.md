The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 3 and i is at least 3. Since p is already equal to i - 1 (3 = 4 - 1), we need to adjust i to be at least 4, so that p is less than i - 1.

State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is equal to n, i is at least 4, d is 0, h is equal to n - ceil(n/2) - (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2, p is 3, g is equal to ceil(n/2) + (n - ceil(n/2) + 1) // 2, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0**
