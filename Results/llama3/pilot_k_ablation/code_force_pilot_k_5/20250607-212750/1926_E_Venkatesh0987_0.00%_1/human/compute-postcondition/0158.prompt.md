Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s, i, d, h, p, g are integers, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0. If k is more than half of n, then s is equal to n, i is at least 1, d and h are 0, p is equal to i + 1, g is equal to n, and the value of y which is 2^(i-1) * (k - n) is being printed. If k is less than or equal to half of n, then s, i, d, h, p, g remain unchanged, and 2 * k - 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is 1. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is equal to i, g is equal to (n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (n+4)//8 + ... + (n+2^(i-1))//2^(i-1), and the value 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value 2 * k - 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is 2. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is less than or equal to k, d is 0, h is -1, p is i, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + ... + 0, and the value of 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is equal to k, i is greater than or equal to i, d is 0, g is increased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, h is decreased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, p is equal to i, f is equal to k - g, and y is equal to 2, and the value of y which is 2 is being printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then this is printed: 2 times k minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is k, i is at least n, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i, g is g + (n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, f is k - g, and the value 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value 2 times k minus 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
