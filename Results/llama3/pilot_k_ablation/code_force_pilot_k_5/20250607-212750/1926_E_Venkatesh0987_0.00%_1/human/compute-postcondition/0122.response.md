The code prints the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin.

Since `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, we can infer that `k` is at most half of `n` plus one, rounded down.

However, without knowing the exact value of `n` and `k`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `2 * k - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be an odd number that is at most `2 * ((n + 1) // 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

Output: **an odd number less than or equal to n**
