Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s, i, d, h, p, g are integers, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0. If k is more than half of n, then s is equal to n, i is at least 1, d and h are 0, p is equal to i + 1, g is equal to n, and the value of y which is 2^(i-1) * (k - n) is being printed. If k is less than or equal to half of n, then s, i, d, h, p, g remain unchanged, and 2 * k - 1 is printed.**
