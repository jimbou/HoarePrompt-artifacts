The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
