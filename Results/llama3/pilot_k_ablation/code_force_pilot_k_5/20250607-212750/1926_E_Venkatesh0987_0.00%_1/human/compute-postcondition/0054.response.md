Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i, g is equal to (n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

In the final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is incremented by 1, making it less than or equal to `i`. The value of `h` is reduced by half, becoming 0. The value of `g` is increased by half of `h + 1`, which is half of 1, making it equal to `(n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t - 2` pairs of integers.
