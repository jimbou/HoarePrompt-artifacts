Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than 2, s is greater than 2 and equal to its original value plus (d+1)//2, i is 3, d is greater than 2 and equal to its original value minus (d+1)//2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0**

The code modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by the integer division of `d + 1` by 2, effectively adding half of `d + 1` to `s`. The second line decrements `d` by the same amount, effectively subtracting half of `d + 1` from `d`. The third line simply increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
