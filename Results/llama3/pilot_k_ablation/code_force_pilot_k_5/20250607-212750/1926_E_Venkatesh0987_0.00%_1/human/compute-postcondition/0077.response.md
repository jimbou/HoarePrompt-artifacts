Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, i is at least 2, d is 0, h is (n - 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, _ is 2**

The code block modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2, which is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 2`. The second line decrements `h` by the same value, resulting in `h` becoming `(n - 1) // 2`. The third line simply increments `p` by 1, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
