Output State: **s is equal to k, i is equal to the number of times the loop executes, d is 0, and the other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable s will be equal to k, the variable i will be equal to the number of times the loop executes, and the variable d will be 0. The other variables, n, h, p, g, and _, will remain unchanged.
