Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than s, s is equal to d, i is 2, d is equal to d // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers, t is at least 1, and _ is 0**

The code block modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by `(d + 1) // 2`, effectively doubling its value. The second line decrements `d` by `(d + 1) // 2`, effectively halving its value. The third line increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
