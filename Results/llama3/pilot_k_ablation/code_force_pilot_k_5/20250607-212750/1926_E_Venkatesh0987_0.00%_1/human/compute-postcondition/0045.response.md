According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, p is 1 and i is an integer greater than 0. i being an integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to i is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**
