Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair consists of a number n and a number k. For each pair, it calculates and prints a value based on whether k is less than or equal to half of n plus one. If k is less than or equal to half of n plus one, it prints 2 times k minus 1. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex value involving powers of 2 and prints that. The function processes all input pairs and prints the corresponding output values.**
