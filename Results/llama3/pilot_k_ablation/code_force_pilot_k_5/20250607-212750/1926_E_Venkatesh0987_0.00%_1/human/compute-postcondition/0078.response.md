To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `p` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2 and `i` is at least 2. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be greater than 2, so that `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is (n - 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, _ is 2**
