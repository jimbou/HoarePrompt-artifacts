Output State: _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer from stdin, s is k, i is the number of times the loop executes, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the value of s is equal to k, the value of d is 0, and the value of i is the number of times the loop executes. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
