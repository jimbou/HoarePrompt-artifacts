The code prints the value of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is an integer less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2)**
