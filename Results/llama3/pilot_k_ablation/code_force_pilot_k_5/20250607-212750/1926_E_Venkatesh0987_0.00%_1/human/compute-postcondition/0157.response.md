Postcondition: ***_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is k, i is at least n, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i, g is g + (n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, f is k - g, and the value 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value 2 times k minus 1 is printed.***
