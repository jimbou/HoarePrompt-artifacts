Output State: **s is increased by half of the original value of d plus one, d is reduced to half of its original value, i is incremented by 1**

In this code block, the first line adds half of the original value of `d` plus one to `s`. The second line reduces `d` to half of its original value. The third line increments `i` by 1. The final state reflects these changes, with `s` increased by half of the original value of `d` plus one, `d` reduced to half of its original value, and `i` incremented by 1.
