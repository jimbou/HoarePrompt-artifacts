Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is 1. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is equal to i, g is equal to (n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (n+4)//8 + ... + (n+2^(i-1))//2^(i-1), and the value 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value 2 * k - 1 is printed.***
