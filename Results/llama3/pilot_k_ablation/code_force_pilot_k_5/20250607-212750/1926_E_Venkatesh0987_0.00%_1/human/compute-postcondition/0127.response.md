To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `s < k and d > 0`.

Given the initial states:
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin
- `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin
- `s` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `d` is `n`
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0

We focus on the variables in the loop condition: `s` and `d`.

1. For `s < k`, since `s` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0 to satisfy this condition.
2. For `d > 0`, since `d` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0 to satisfy this condition.

Thus, the states that need adjustment are `k` and `n`, to ensure they are both greater than 0.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the first integer from stdin, `k` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer from stdin, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**
