Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i, g is equal to (n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**

In this final state, the value of `g` has been updated by adding `(h + 1) // 2` to its initial value. The value of `h` has been updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from its initial value, effectively setting it to 0. The value of `p` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
