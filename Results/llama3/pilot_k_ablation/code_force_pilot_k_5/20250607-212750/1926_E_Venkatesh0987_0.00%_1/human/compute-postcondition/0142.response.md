The code block modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`. Since `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, we can substitute this value into the expression. The second line decrements `h` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, effectively setting it to 0. The third line increments `p` by 1.

Output State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is k, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is 0, p is 3, g is g + (n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2**
