To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `s`, `k`, and `d` according to the loop condition `s < k and d > 0`.

1.  Since `s` is equal to `d`, we can only adjust `s` and `d` together.
2.  At the end of the last iteration, `d` is equal to `d // 2`, which means `d` has been halved. To ensure `d > 0` for the next iteration, we need to adjust `d` so that it is greater than 1 after being halved. This means `d` must be greater than 2 before the next iteration.
3.  Since `s` is equal to `d`, we also need to adjust `s` to be greater than 2.
4.  `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than `s`. To ensure `s < k`, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than the new value of `s`, which is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than 2, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is greater than 2, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` pairs of integers, `t` is at least 1, and `_` is 0**
