According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2, `i` is at least 2. `i` being at least 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is k, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is n - (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is g + (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains 0 inputs**
