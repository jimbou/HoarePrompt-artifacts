According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is less than `i`, and `i` is greater than 1. `p` being less than `i` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i - 1, g is equal to (n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (h + 1) // 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**
