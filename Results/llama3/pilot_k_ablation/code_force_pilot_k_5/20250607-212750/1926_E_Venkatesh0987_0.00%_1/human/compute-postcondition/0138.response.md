Output State: _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the first integer from stdin, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer from stdin, s is k, i is the number of times the loop executed, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable s has reached the value of k, the variable i has been incremented to the number of times the loop executed, and the variable d has been reduced to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
