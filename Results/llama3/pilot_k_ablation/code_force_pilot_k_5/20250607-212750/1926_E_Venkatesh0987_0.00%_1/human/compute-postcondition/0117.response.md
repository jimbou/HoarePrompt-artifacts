Output State: **s is equal to k, i is greater than or equal to i, d is 0, g is increased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, h is decreased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, p is equal to i.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of s remains equal to k, the value of i remains greater than or equal to itself (i.e., it doesn't change), the value of d remains 0, the value of g is increased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, the value of h is decreased by the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (h + 1) // 2, and the value of p is equal to i.
