The variable in the loop head is variable p and i, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is less than or equal to i, So for the loop to be executed one more time p must be less than or equal to i - 1 and i must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than 0, s is less than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is less than or equal to i - 1, g is equal to (n+1)//2 + (n+2)//4 + (h + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers**
