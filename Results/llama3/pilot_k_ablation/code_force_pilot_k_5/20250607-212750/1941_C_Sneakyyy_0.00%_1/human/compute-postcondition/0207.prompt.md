Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a string of at least 2 characters, s is a substring of a from index len(a) - 3 to len(a) - 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 4, ans is 0, and i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) - 2:
    s = a[i:i + 3]
    print(s)
    if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
        i += 3
        ans += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 3 or 2 or 1 and `i` is less than len(a) - 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 2 or 1 or 0 and `i` is less than len(a) - 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is 1 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 4`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *`a` is a string of more than 4 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 4 or 3 or 2 and `i` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 3 or 2 or 1 and `i` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is 3 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 4`, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 4`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 4`, then `ans` is 1 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 5`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 2` to `i + 5` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *`a` is a string of more than 5 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is either 5, 4, 3, or 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is either 4, 3, 2, or 1. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 4`, then `ans` is either 4, 3, or 2 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 4`, then `ans` is either 3, 2, or 1 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 5`, then `ans` is 3 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 5`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 6`, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 2` to `i + 6` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 6`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 3` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 6`, then `ans` is 1 and `i + 3` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 4` to `i + 7`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i + 3` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 3` to `i + 7` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 2` to `i + 6` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
