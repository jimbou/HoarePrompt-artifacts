The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 8, and `a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `i` must be less than the length of `a` minus 2. Since `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 8, the length of `a` must be at least 7 if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6, or the length of `a` must be at least 6 if `i` is 2 or 3. Also, `a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3, so the length of `a` is already at least 8. Therefore, the length of `a` must be at least 7 if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6, or the length of `a` must be at least 6 if `i` is 2 or 3, but since the length of `a` is already at least 8, the length of `a` is already sufficient. However, `i` must be less than the length of `a` minus 2, so `i` must be less than 6 if the length of `a` is 8, or `i` must be less than 7 if the length of `a` is 9 or more. Since `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 8, `i` must be less than 6 if the length of `a` is 8, or `i` must be less than 7 if the length of `a` is 9 or more. Therefore, `i` must be either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 if the length of `a` is 8, or `i` must be either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6 if the length of `a` is 9 or more. Since `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 8, `i` must be either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6**
