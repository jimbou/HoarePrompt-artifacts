Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 7 characters if `i` is 4 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 6, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2, and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `s`, which is either 'map' or 'pie' if `ans` is 1 and `i` is either 4 or 6, or any other value if `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2. The substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.
