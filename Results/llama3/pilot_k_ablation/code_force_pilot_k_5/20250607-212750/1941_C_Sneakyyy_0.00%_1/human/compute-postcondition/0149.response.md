Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i+1` to `i+3`, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is either 3, 5 or 7, and the previous value of `s` has been printed, and the current value of `s` which is a substring of `a` from index `i+1` to `i+3` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3, 5, or 7. As a result, the substring `s` is now a substring of `a` from index `i+1` to `i+3`. The other variables, `a` and `ans`, remain unchanged. The previous value of `s` has been printed, and the current value of `s` is being printed.
