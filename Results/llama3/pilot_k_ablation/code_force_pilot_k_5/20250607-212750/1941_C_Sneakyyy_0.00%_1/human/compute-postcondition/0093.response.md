Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, ans is 0, i is 1, and the substring s of string a from index 0 to 2 which is [s] is being printed. The substring s is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, including `a`, `s`, stdin, _, ans, and the substring s being printed. The substring s is still neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
