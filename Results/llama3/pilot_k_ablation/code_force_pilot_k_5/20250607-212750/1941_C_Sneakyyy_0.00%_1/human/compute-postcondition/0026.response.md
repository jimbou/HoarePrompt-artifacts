Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 9 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, the first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed, `s` is now a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, and the substring `s` is printed, `s` is now a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`. All other variables remain unchanged. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed.
