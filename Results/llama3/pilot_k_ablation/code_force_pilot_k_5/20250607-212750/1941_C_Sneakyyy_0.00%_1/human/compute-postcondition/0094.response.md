Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, and the substring s of string a from index 0 to 2 which is [s] is being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 3. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 1.***
