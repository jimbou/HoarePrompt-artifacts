Output State: **`a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 4`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, and the substring `s` is now shifted one character to the right, starting from index `i + 1` to `i + 4`. The value of `i` has increased by 1. The values of `ans` and the conditions related to `s` being 'map' or 'pie' remain the same, but now they are applied to the new substring `s` starting from index `i + 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` and the value of `_` remain unchanged.
