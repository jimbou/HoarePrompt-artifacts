Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, and the substring `s` which is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2 is being printed. Additionally, `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still has at least 3 characters, `s` is still a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, and `s` is still being printed. The number of test cases in stdin is still t - 3, and the values of `_` and `ans` are still 3 and 0, respectively. The condition that `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie' also remains true.
