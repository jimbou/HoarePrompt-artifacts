To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables and adjust their states accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are `_` and `input()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `input()` has been consumed t-1 times.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `input()` needs to have at least one more test case.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1 (incremented by 1)
* `input()` has at least t test cases (one more test case)

The other variables `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`stdin` contains t test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 1 character, `i` is len(a) - 2, `ans` is the number of substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a, and the number of substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a which is ans is being printed**
