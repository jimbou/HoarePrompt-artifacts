Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 1 character, ans is 0, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) - 2:
    s = a[i:i + 3]
    print(s)
    if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
        i += 3
        ans += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 0 and ending at index 2, the first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` has been printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 5 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, the first 3 characters of the string a which is s have been printed. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then i is 4 or 6 and ans is 1 or 2. Otherwise, i is 2 and ans is 0, and the substring s is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 9 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, the first 3 characters of the string a which is s have been printed. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then i is 5 or 7 or 9 and ans is 1 or 2 or 3. Otherwise, i is 3 and ans is 0, and the substring s is printed, s is now a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, and the substring s is printed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 9 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 more than its original value and `ans` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 10 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, and the substring `s` is printed. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed, and the substring `s` is printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 more than its original value and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 more than its original value, `ans` is 0, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
