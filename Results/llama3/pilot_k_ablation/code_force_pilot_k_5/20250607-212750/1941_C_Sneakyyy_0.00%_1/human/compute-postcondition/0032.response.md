The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is less than len(a) - 2 and a is a string of at least 9 characters, So for the loop to be executed one more time a must be a string of at least 10 characters and i must be less than len(a) - 3.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 10 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 more than its original value and `ans` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `i` is less than `len(a) - 3` and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed.**
