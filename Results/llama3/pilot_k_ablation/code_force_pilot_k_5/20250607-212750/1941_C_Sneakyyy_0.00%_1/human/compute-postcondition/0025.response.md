According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 or 5 or 7 or 9, and `a` is a string of at least 9 characters. `i` being 3 or 5 or 7 or 9 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 9 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, the first 3 characters of the string a which is s have been printed. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then i is less than len(a) - 2 and ans is 1 or 2 or 3. Otherwise, i is less than len(a) - 2 and ans is 0, and the substring s is printed, s is now a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, and the substring s is printed**
