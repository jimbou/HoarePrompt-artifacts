The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `stdin` must contain `t - 2` test cases.
State: **`a` is a string of at least 2 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 4, `ans` is the total number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is `len(a) - 2`**
