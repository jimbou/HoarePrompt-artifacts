Output: **`a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is less than len(a) - 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is less than len(a) - 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is less than len(a) - 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed.**
