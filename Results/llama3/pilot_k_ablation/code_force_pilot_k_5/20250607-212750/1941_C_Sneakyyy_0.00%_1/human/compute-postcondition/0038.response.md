Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 10 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, and the substring `s` is printed. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed, and the substring `s` is printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 more than its original value and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 more than its original value, `ans` is 0, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`.***
