Output State: **a is a string of at least 9 characters if i is 4 or 5 or a is a string of at least 8 characters if i is 2 or 3, s is a substring of a from index i to i + 3, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, i is either 7 or 5 or 8 or 6, ans is 3 if s is either 'map' or 'pie' and i is either 4 or 6, ans is 2 if s is either 'map' or 'pie' and i is either 5 or 7, otherwise ans is 1 and the substring s of string a from index i to i + 3 which is [s] is being printed.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3, so `i` becomes either 7 or 5 or 8 or 6. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` becomes 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, `ans` becomes 2. Otherwise, `ans` becomes 1. The substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is still being printed.
