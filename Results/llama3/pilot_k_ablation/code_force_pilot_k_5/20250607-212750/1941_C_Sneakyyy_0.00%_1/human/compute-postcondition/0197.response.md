Output State: **a is a string of more than 4 characters, s is a substring of a from index i to i + 3, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 4. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then ans is either 4 or 3 or 2 and i is less than len(a) - 3. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then ans is either 3 or 2 or 1 and i is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring s of a from index i to i + 3 is being printed. If s is 'map' or 'pie' at index i + 1 to i + 3, then ans is 3 and i + 1 is less than len(a) - 3. If s is not 'map' or 'pie' at index i + 1 to i + 3, then ans is 2 and i + 1 is less than len(a) - 3 if s is 'map' or 'pie' at index i + 2 to i + 4, otherwise ans is 1 and i + 1 is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring s of a from index i + 1 to i + 4 is being printed, and the substring s of a from index i to i + 3 is being printed.**

Explanation: The code increments `i` by 3 and increments `ans` by 1. This means that the index `i` is now 3 positions ahead, and the value of `ans` is increased by 1. The conditions related to `s` being 'map' or 'pie' and the printing of substrings are still valid, but the values of `ans` and `i` have been updated accordingly.
