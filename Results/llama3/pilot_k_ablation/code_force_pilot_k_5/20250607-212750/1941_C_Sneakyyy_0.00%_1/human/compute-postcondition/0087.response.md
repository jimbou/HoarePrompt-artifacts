Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, ans is 0, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2, which means it is the first three characters of the string `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
