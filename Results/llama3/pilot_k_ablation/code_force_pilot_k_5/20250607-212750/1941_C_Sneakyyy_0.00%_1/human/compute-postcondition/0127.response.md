Output State: **a is a string of at least 2 characters, s is a substring of a from index len(a) - 3 to len(a) - 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 3, ans is 0, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to a new string input from stdin, which contains at least 2 characters. The value of `s` remains a substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a) - 1`, but its actual value is not specified since the new value of `a` is unknown. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, from `t - 2` to `t - 3`. The values of `_`, `ans`, and `i` have been reset to 3, 0, and 0, respectively.
