Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+2`, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is either 2, 4 or 6, and the previous value of `s` has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to a new substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+2`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain the same as before, but their values depend on the previous value of `s`. If the previous value of `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If the previous value of `s` was not 'map' or 'pie' but was initially 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. In all other cases, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2. The previous value of `s` has been printed, and `a` remains a string of at least 9 characters.
