Based on the precondition, we know that `a` is a string of at least 13, 15, or 17 characters, and `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`. We also know that `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `i` is either 6, 8, or 10.

Since `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, we can conclude that `s` is a 4-character substring of `a`.

Now, let's analyze the possible values of `s` based on the given conditions:

* If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `i` is either 8 or 10. This means that `s` can be either 'map' or 'pie' if `i` is 8 or 10.
* Otherwise, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is either 6 or 8. This means that `s` can be any 4-character substring of `a` if `i` is 6 or 8.

Since we don't know the exact value of `a` or `i`, we can't determine the exact value of `s`. However, we can conclude that `s` will be a 4-character substring of `a`, and its value will depend on the value of `i`.

Output: **a 4-character substring of `a` starting from index `i` (where `i` is either 6, 8, or 10)**
