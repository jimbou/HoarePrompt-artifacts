Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, the first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` has been printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**

The code updates the value of `s` to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`. The value of `i` and `ans` remains the same as before, depending on the initial value of `s`. The other variables `_` and `a` are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
