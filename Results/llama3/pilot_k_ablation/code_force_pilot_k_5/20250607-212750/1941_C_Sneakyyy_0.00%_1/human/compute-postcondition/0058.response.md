Output State: **`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 4 characters if `i` is 2 or `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 4, `i` is either 2 or 4, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 1`, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 4 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `ans` is 0. , and this is printed: a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 1` which is either 'map' or 'pie' if `i` is 4 and `ans` is 1, or any substring of `a` from index 1 to 3 if `i` is 2 and `ans` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged, but the substring `s` of `a` is now from index `i - 1` to `i + 1` instead of from index `i` to `i + 2`. The rest of the conditions and printed values remain the same.
