Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of at least 9 characters. If the current substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i+2` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `s` is updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i+3` to `i+5`, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, and `i` is either 5, 7 or 9. Otherwise, `s` is updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i+1` to `i+3`, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `i` is either 3, 5 or 7. In both cases, the previous value of `s` has been printed, and the current value of `s` is being printed.***
