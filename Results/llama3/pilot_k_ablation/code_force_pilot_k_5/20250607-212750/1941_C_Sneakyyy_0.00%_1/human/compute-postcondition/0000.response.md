The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains t test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be at least 1**
