Based on the precondition, the code prints the substring `s` of the string `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`. 

Since `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, and the first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed, the value of `s` is the next 3 characters of the string `a` starting at index `i`.

However, the exact value of `s` cannot be determined without knowing the exact string `a` and the index `i`. 

Therefore, the print statement will output the substring `s` of the string `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`.

Output: **the substring s of the string a starting at index i and ending at index i+2**
