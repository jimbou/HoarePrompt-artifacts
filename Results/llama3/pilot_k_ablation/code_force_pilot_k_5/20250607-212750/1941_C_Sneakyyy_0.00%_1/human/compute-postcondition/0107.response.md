Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 7 characters if `i` is 5 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 7, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 5 or 3, and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 5 or 7. The length of string `a` is still at least 7 characters if `i` is 5 or at least 8 characters if `i` is 7. The substring `s` is still a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The values of `_` and `ans` remain the same, and the substring `s` is still being printed.
