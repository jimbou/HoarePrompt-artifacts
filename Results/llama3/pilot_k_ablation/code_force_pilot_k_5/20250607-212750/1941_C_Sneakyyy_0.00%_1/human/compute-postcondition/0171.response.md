Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, since `i` is 0, `s` is now a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
