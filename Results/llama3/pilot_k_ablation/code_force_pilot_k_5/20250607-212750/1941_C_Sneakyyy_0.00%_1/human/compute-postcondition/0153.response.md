The code prints a substring `s` of the string `a`. The substring `s` is obtained by taking 4 consecutive characters of `a` starting from index `i`. Since `i` can be either 5, 7, or 9, the substring `s` will be a 4-character substring of `a` starting from one of these indices.

Output: **a 4-character substring of `a` starting from index `i` (where `i` is either 5, 7, or 9)**
