According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `a` is a string of at least 3 characters. If `i` is 1, `a` being a string of at least 3 characters is enough to ensure that the loop will execute again. However, if `i` is 3, `a` being a string of at least 3 characters does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` being a string of at least 6 characters. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a string of at least 6 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, and the substring s of string a from index 0 to 2 which is [s] is being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 3. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 1**
