Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 11, 13 or 15 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, and `i` is either 5, 7 or 9**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, which is a substring of length 3. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
