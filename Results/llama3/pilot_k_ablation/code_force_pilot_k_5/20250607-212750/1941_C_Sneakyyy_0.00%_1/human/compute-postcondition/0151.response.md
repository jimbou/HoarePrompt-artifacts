According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 5, 7 or 9, and `a` is a string of at least 9 characters. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `a` must be a string of at least 11, 13 or 15 characters respectively. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a string of at least 11, 13 or 15 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i+1` to `i+3` or `i+3` to `i+5`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, and `i` is either 5, 7 or 9**
