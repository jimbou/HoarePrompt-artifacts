The variable in the loop head is i and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a. If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 4, 6 or 2, and a is a string of at least 5 characters. For the loop to execute again, i must be less than len(a) - 2. Since i is either 4, 6 or 2, len(a) must be greater than 6, 8 or 4 respectively. So len(a) must be greater than 8. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 9 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, the first 3 characters of the string a which is s have been printed. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then i is 4 or 6 and ans is 1 or 2. Otherwise, i is 2 and ans is 0, and the substring s is printed.**
