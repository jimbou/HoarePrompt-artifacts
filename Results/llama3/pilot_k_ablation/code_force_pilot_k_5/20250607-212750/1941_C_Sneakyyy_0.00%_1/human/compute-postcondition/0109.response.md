According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3, and `a` is a string of at least 7 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 6 or 7. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`. If `i` is 4 or 5, `a` must be a string of at least 7 characters and `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `a` must be a string of at least 9 characters. If `i` is 2 or 3, `a` must be a string of at least 7 characters and `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `a` must be a string of at least 8 characters. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3, and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.**
