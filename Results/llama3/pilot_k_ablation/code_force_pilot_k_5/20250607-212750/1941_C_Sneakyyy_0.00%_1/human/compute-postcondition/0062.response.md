The code prints a substring `s` of the string `a`. The substring `s` is determined based on the value of `i`. If `i` is 1 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `i` is 2 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2`. If `i` is 4 or 6, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i`. The exact value of `s` depends on the value of `i` and the string `a`.

Output: **a substring s of string a (where s is a substring of a from index i to i + 3 if i is 1 or 3, or s is a substring of a from index i - 1 to i + 2 if i is 2 or 4, or s is a substring of a from index i - 3 to i if i is 4 or 6)**
