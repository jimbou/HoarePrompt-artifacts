To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition `i < len(a) - 2`. Since `i` is 0, we need to focus on adjusting the state of `a` to guarantee the loop can execute.

The condition `i < len(a) - 2` implies that `len(a)` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute. Since `a` is already a string of at least 1 character, we need to adjust its state to ensure it has at least 3 characters.

State: **stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 1, a is a string of at least 3 characters, i is 0, ans is 0**
