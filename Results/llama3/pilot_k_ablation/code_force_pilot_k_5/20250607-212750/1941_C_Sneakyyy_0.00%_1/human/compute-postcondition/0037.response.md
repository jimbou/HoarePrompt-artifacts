Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 10 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+3`, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed, and the substring `s` is printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so the substring `s` now starts at index `i+1` and ends at index `i+3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The substring `s` is still printed, and the first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed.
