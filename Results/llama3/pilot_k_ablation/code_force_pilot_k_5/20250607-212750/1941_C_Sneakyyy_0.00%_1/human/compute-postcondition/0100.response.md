Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 6 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is either 4 or 2, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 4, otherwise, it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is still being printed.
