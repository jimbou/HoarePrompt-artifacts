Output State: **a is a string of at least 9 characters if i is 4 or 5 or 6 or a is a string of at least 8 characters if i is 2 or 3, s is a substring of a from index i to i + 3, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, i is either 7 or 5 or 8 or 6, ans is 4 if s is either 'map' or 'pie' and i is either 4 or 6, ans is 3 if s is either 'map' or 'pie' and i is either 5 or 7, ans is 2 if s is either 'map' or 'pie' and i is either 6 or 8, otherwise ans is 1 and the substring s of a from index i to i + 3 is being printed.**

The code increments `i` by 3 and increments `ans` by 1. The value of `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6, and the value of `ans` is either 3 or 2 or 1 or 0. The value of `a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6 or a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3. The value of `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The value of `_` is 2. Stdin contains `t - 3` test cases.
