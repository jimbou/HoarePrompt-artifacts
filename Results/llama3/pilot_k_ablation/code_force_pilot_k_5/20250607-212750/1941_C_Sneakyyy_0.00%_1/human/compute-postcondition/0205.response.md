Output State: **`a` is a string of more than 5 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 4`, then `ans` is either 4 or 3 or 2 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 4`, then `ans` is either 3 or 2 or 1 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 5`, then `ans` is 3 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 5`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 6`, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i + 2` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 2` to `i + 6` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 6`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 3` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 3` to `i + 6`, then `ans` is 1 and `i + 3` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 4` to `i + 7`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i + 3` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 3` to `i + 7` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 2` to `i + 6` is being printed, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains the same, and the substring `s` is now considered from index `i + 1` to `i + 4`. The value of `ans` depends on whether `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at different indices, and the corresponding substrings are being printed. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.
