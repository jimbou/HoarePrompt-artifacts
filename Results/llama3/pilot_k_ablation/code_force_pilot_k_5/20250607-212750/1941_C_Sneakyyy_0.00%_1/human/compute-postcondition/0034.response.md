The code prints the substring `s` of the string `a` which starts at index `i` and ends at index `i+2`. Since `i` is less than `len(a) - 3`, the substring `s` is a subset of the string `a` with a length of 3 characters. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have already been printed.

Output: **the substring s of the string a starting at index i and ending at index i+2 (which is a subset of the string a with a length of 3 characters)**
