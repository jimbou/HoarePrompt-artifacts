Output State: **a is a string of at least 11, 13 or 15 characters, s is a substring of a from index i to i+3, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, and i is either 8, 10 or 12, and the substring s of a from index i to i+3 is being printed**

Explanation:
The first line increments `i` by 3, changing its value from either 5, 7, or 9 to either 8, 10, or 12. The second line increments `ans` by 1, changing its value from either 0, 1, 2, or 3 to either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The value of `a` and the fact that `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3` remain unchanged.
