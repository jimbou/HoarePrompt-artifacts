Output State: **`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7, or `a` is a string of at least 6 characters if `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is increased by 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7 and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is printed, and `i` is increased by 1 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', and the value of `s` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` and `ans` will be updated based on the value of `s` in the next steps.
