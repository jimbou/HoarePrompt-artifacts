Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 13, 15 or 17 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, and `i` is either 6, 8 or 10. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4 and `i` is either 8 or 10. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 and `i` is either 6 or 8.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `ans` and `i` are still valid, and the relationship between `s` and the values of `ans` and `i` is maintained.
