Output State: **`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The code extracts a substring `s` of length 3 from the string `a`, starting from the first character (at index 0). The value of `s` is now the first three characters of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
