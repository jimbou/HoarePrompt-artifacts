Postcondition: **`a` is a string of at least 13, 15 or 17 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, and `i` is either 7, 9, 11 or 13. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 and `i` is either 9, 11 or 13. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and `i` is either 7 or 9, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i+3` is being printed.**
