Output State: **a is a string of at least 6 characters, s is a substring of a from index i to i + 3, ans is either 1 or 2 depending on whether s is 'map' or 'pie', i is either 4 or 6 depending on whether s is 'map' or 'pie', _ is 2, and the substring s of string a from index i to i + 3 which is [s] is being printed, stdin contains t - 3 test cases.**

The code increments `i` by 3, so its new value depends on its initial value. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` was 3, so it becomes 6. Otherwise, `i` was 1, so it becomes 4. The code also increments `ans` by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` was 1, so it becomes 2. Otherwise, `ans` was 0, so it becomes 1. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
