Based on the precondition, the value of `s` is a substring of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. Since `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3, the substring `s` will be a 4-character substring of `a` starting from one of these indices.

The precondition also states that `a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5, or a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3. This ensures that the substring `s` will always exist and will be a 4-character string.

Therefore, when the print statement is executed, it will print the 4-character substring `s` of string `a` starting from index `i`.

Output: **a 4-character substring of string a starting from index i**
