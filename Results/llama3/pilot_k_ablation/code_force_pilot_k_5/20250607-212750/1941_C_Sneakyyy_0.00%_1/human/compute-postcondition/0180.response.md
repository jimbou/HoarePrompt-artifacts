Output State: **`a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` and `i` still depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. The substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed.
