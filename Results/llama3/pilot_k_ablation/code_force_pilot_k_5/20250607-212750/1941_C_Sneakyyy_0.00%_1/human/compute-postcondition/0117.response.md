Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` has at least 9 characters if `i` is 4, 5, or 6, and at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3. The substring `s` is now a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The number of test cases in stdin is still `t - 3`. The value of `_` is still 2. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `s` and `i`: if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, then `ans` is 3; if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, then `ans` is 2; if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, then `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0. The value of `i` is still either 4, 2, 5, 3, or 6.
