Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 13, 15 or 17 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, and `i` is either 7, 9 or 11. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4 and `i` is either 9 or 11. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 and `i` is either 7 or 9, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i+3` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 7, 9, or 11. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `ans` and `s` still apply. The substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i+3` is still being printed.
