Output State: **i is 4 or 6, ans is 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 5 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i-3 and ending at index i, the first 3 characters of the string a which is s have been printed.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 4, and if `i` was 3, it becomes 6. The code also increments the value of `ans` by 1, so if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `ans` was 1, it becomes 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
