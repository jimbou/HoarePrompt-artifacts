Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 10 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, `i` is less than `len(a) - 3` and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` have been printed. The value of `i` is still less than `len(a) - 3` and `ans` is still 0.
