Output State: **i is either 4 or 6, ans is either 1 or 2, a is a string of at least 4 characters if i is 4 or a is a string of at least 5 characters if i is 6, s is a substring of a from index i - 3 to i - 1, and the substring s of a from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 6 and ans is 2. Otherwise, i is 4 and ans is 1.**

Explanation: The first line increments `i` by 3. Since `i` is either 1 or 3, it becomes either 4 or 6. The second line increments `ans` by 1. Since `ans` is either 0 or 1, it becomes either 1 or 2. The value of `a` remains unchanged, but its length is still at least 4 characters if `i` is 4 or at least 5 characters if `i` is 6. The value of `s` is also unchanged, but it is now a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i - 1`. The printed substring of `a` from index 0 to 2 remains the same. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 6 and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 4 and `ans` is 1.
