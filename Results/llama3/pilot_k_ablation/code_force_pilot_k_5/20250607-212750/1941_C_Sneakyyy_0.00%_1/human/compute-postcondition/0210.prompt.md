Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        print(s)
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 1 character, i is len(a) - 2, ans is the number of substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a, and the number of substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 1 character, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and all substrings of `a` from index 0 to `len(a) - 2` have been printed, and the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a string of at least `len(a) - 2` characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a) - 1`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a` as a substring, and `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a` as a substring which is equal to `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The loop has finished executing, `a` is a string of at least 2 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is the total number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and the total number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `a` is a string of at least 2 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4, `ans` is the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
