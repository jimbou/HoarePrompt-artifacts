Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of at least 6 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is either 4 or 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2.***
