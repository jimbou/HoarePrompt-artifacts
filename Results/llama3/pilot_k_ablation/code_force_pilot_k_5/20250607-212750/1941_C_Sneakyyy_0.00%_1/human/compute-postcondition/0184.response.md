Output State: **`a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1. This affects the substring `s` of `a`, which is now from index `i + 1` to `i + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` and `i` are still dependent on the value of `s`, which is now shifted by one position.
