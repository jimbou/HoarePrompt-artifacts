The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns the input from stdin to the variable `a`. Since stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, this line consumes one test case, leaving `t - 3` test cases in stdin. The second line resets the value of `ans` to 0. The third line resets the value of `i` to 0.

Output State: **a is a string of at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, ans is 0, i is 0**
