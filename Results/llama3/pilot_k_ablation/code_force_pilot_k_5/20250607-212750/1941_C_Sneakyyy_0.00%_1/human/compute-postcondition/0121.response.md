Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 5 or 6 or 7 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 3 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 7 or 9, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 5 or 3 or 6 or 4 or 7, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` can be 4, 2, 5, 3, or 6. After incrementing, `i` can be 5, 3, 6, 4, or 7. The length of string `a` is at least 9 characters if `i` is 5, 6, or 7, or at least 8 characters if `i` is 3 or 4. The substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `s` and `i`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, then `ans` is 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, then `ans` is 2. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 7 or 9, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
