Output: ** `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 1, 2, or 4, or `a` is a string of at least 6 characters if `i` is 3 or 6, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` if `i` is 1 or 3, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` if `i` is 2 or 4, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i` if `i` is 4 or 6, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 or 6 and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1, 2, or 4 and `ans` is 0 or 1, and the substring `s` of `a` is printed.**
