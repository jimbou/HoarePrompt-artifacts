Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 5 or 6 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 3 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 5 or 3 or 6 or 4, and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The length of string `a` and the conditions for `ans` have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. The substring `s` is still being printed.
