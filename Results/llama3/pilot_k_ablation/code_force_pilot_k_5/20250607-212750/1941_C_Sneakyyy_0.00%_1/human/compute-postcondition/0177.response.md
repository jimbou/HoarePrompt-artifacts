Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 1, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed. The substring `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` still has at least 3 characters, and the substring `s` is still a part of `a` but now it starts from index 1 and ends at index 3. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, and the values of `_` and `ans` are unchanged. The index `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The substring `s` is still being printed and it is still neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
