Output: ** `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 4 characters if `i` is 1 or `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 3, `i` is either 1 or 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0. , and this is printed: a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` which is either 'map' or 'pie' if `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1, or any substring of `a` from index 1 to 3 if `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0**
