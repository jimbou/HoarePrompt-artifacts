The code prints the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`. Based on the precondition, `s` can be either 'map' or 'pie' if `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3, or it can be any other substring of `a` if `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.
Output: ** `a` is a string of more than 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` is being printed**
