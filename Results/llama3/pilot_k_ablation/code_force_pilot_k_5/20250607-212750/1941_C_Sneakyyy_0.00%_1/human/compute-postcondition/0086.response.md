To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `a` is a string of at least 1 character.

For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be at least 3, so that `len(a) - 2` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to be a string of at least 3 characters.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **a is a string of at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, ans is 0, i is 0**
