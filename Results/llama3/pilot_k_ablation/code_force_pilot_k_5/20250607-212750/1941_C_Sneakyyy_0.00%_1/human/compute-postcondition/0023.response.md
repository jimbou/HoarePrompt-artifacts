Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, a is a string of at least 9 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, the first 3 characters of the string a which is s have been printed. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then i is 5 or 7 and ans is 1 or 2. Otherwise, i is 3 and ans is 0, and the substring s is printed, s is now a substring of a starting at index i and ending at index i+2, and the substring s is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The variable `_` is still 0. The string `a` still has at least 9 characters. The substring `s` is still a part of `a`, but now it starts at the new index `i` and ends at `i+2`. The first 3 characters of `a` which is `s` have already been printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 5 or 7 and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is now 3 and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` has been printed. The substring `s` is now a part of `a` starting at the new index `i` and ending at `i+2`, and it has been printed.
