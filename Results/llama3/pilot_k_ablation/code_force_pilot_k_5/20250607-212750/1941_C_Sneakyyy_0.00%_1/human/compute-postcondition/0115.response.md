Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of at least 9 characters if `i` is 4 or 5 or 6 or `a` is a string of at least 8 characters if `i` is 2 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 5 or 7, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is either 6 or 8, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 4 or 2 or 5 or 3 or 6 or 7 or 8, and the substring `s` of string `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` which is `[s]` is being printed.***
