Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 1, a is a string of at least 1 character, i is 0, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) - 2:
    s = a[i:i + 3]
    print(s)
    if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
        i += 3
        ans += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `i` is either 1 or 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 4 characters if `i` is 1, 2, or 4, or `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 3 or 6, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2` if `i` is 1 or 3, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 1` if `i` is 2 or 4, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i - 1` if `i` is 4 or 6, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 or 6 and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1, 2, or 4 and `ans` is 0 or 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7, or `a` is a string of at least 6 characters if `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` if `i` is 1 or 3, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` if `i` is 2 or 4, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i` if `i` is 4, 6, 7, or 9, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7 and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is printed, and `i` is increased by 1 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie'.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7, or `a` is a string of at least 6 characters if `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and `i` is less than `len(a) - 3`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` if `i` is 1 or 3, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` if `i` is 2 or 4, or `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i` if `i` is 4, 6, 7, or 9, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is increased by 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7 and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is printed, and `i` is increased by 1 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', and the value of `s` is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters if `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7, or `a` is a string of at least 6 characters if `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3, 5, 6, or 9 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is increased by 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1, 2, 4, or 7 and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is printed, and `i` is increased by 1 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', and the value of `s` is printed, and the value of `s` is printed, and `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
