The only objects in the loop head are variable  `_` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 1 test case the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least `t - 2` test cases and the `_` is 3.
State: **`a` is a string of at least `len(a) - 2` characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a) - 1`, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a` as a substring, and `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a` as a substring which is equal to `ans` is being printed**
