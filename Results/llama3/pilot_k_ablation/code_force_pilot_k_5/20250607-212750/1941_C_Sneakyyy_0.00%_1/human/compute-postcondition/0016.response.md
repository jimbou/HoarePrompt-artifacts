Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a string of at least 5 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+2`, the first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` has been printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 4 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `ans` is 0, and the substring `s` is printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 4, otherwise it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The first 3 characters of the string `a` which is `s` has been printed, and if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then the substring `s` is printed. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
