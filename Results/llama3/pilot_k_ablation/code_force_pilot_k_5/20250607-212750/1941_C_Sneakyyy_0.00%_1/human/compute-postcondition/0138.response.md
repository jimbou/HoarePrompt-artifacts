Output State: **`a` is a string of at least 4 characters if `i` is 1, or at least 6 characters if `i` is 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state, but their relationship with `s` has been updated. The length of `a` is still constrained based on the value of `i`.
