Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of at least 6 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 3 to 6, and the substring `s` has been printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but was initially 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. In all other cases, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
