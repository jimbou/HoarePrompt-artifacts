Output State: **`a` is a string of more than 4 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 3 or 2 or 1 and `i` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 2 or 1 or 0 and `i` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` is being printed. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is 2 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 1` to `i + 3`, then `ans` is 1 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' at index `i + 2` to `i + 4`, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i + 1` is less than len(a) - 3, and the substring `s` of `a` from index `i + 1` to `i + 4` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` and `i` are still dependent on whether `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and the printing of substrings is still based on the values of `s` at different indices.
