Output State: **i is increased by 3, ans is increased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 1, a is a string of at least 5 characters if i is 1, 2, 4, or 7, or a is a string of at least 6 characters if i is 3, 5, 6, or 9, i is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and i is less than len(a) - 2, ans is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, s is a substring of a from index i to i + 3, and the substring s of a from index 0 to 2 has been printed. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 3, 5, 6, or 9 and ans is 1, 2, or 3, and i is increased by 3. Otherwise, i is 1, 2, 4, or 7 and ans is 0, 1, or 2, and the substring s of a is printed, and i is increased by 1 if s is not 'map' or 'pie', and the value of s is printed, and the value of s is printed.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3 and the value of `ans` by 1. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now increased by 3, and the value of `ans` is now increased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
