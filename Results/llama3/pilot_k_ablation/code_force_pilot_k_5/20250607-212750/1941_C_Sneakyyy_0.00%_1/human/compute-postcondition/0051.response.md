Output State: **`stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `a` is a string of at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has been printed, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 has already been printed, and `s` is still neither 'map' nor 'pie'. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, and the values of `_`, `a`, `ans` are still the same.
