The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is either 3 or 1, so the value of `i` is either 4 or 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The substring `s` is still being printed. The output state is: `a` is a string of at least 6 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 3 to 6, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and the substring `s` is being printed.
