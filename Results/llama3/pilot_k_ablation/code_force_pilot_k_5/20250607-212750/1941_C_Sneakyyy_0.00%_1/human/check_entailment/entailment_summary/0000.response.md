Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to count the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in a given string. However, the problem statement requires the program to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program does not correctly address this requirement. It simply counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' and prints this count, without considering the actual deletion of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
