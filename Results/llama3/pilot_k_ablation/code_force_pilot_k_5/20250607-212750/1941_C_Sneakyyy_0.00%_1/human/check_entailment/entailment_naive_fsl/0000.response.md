Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapmap", the program will count it as 2 occurrences, but it should be counted as 1 because removing one "map" will make the string beautiful. 

The program increments the index `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie", but it should increment `i` by 1 to check for overlapping substrings. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                ans += 1
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected program will correctly count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
