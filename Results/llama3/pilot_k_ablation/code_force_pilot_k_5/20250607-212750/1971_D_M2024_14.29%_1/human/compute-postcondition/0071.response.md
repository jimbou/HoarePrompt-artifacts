Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is at least 2, `cut` is either 1 or 2, and `_` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
