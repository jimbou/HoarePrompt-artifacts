Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains 0 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, _ is t-1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, i is len(a) - 1, and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a plus 1 is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, the standard input `stdin` is empty, the loop counter `_` is one less than the initial value of `t`, the string `a` is the last string processed by the loop, the variable `cut` holds the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the last string `a`, the variable `i` is the last index of the last string `a`, and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the last string `a` plus 1 is being printed.
