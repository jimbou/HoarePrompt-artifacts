Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 5, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 4. If the character at index `i` in `a` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` in `a` is '0', then `cut` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
