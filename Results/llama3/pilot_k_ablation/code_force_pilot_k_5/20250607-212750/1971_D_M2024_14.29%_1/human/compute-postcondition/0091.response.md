To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a` and the current value of `i`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` has a length of at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The length of `a` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `_` is 4. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 1. Otherwise, `cut` remains 0.**
