Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 5, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 4. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is either 4 or 5, and `_` is either unchanged or 2. Otherwise, `cut` is either 2 or 3, and `_` is either unchanged or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` was either 3 or 4, and now it is either 4 or 5. Otherwise, `cut` was either 1 or 2, and now it is either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
