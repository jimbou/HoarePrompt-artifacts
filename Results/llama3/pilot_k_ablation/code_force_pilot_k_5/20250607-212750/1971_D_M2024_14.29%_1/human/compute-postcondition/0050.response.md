Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, and if the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 2 and `_` is 2, otherwise `cut` is 1 and the value of `_` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then the value of `cut` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
