Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is 4, and `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `stdin`, and `_` as in the initial state. The value of `i` will be the last index of the string `a`, and the value of `cut` will be the total number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string `a`.
