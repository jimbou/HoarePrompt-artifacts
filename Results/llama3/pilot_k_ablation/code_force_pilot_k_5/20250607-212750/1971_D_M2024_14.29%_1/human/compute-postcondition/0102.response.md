Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 5, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 4, `_` is 4. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 5. Otherwise, `cut` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is now 5. Otherwise, `cut` is now 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
