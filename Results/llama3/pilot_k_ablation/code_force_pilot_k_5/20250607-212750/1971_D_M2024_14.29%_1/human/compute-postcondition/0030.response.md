Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is either 2 or 1, and `_` is either 1 or remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `cut` and `_` remain unchanged.***
