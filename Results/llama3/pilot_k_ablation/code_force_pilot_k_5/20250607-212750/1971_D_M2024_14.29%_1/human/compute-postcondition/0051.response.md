Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, and `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 2 and `_` is 2. Otherwise, `cut` is 1 and the value of `_` remains unchanged.***
