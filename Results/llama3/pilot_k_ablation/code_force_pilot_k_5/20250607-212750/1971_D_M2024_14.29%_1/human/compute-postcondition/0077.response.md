Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is at least 4, `_` is 3, and `cut` is either 3 or 4 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut` is either 2 or 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is now either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `cut` is now either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
