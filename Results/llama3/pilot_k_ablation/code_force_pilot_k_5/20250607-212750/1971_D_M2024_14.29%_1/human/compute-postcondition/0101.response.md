The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `a` has a length at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have a length at least 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 5, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 4, `_` is 4. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 4. Otherwise, `cut` is 3.**
