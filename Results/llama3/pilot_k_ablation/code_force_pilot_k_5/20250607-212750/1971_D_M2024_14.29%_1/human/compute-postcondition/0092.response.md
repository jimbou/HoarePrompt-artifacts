Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `_` is 4. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 2. Otherwise, `cut` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `a`, `stdin`, `i`, and `_` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `cut` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` becomes 2. Otherwise, `cut` becomes 1.
