Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `_` is 4, `cut` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still has a length of at least 2 and consists of characters '0' and '1'. The current character at index `i` is still '1' and the current character at index `i + 1` is still '0'. The number of strings in `stdin` is still `t-7`, and each string still consists of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500. The value of `t` is still between 2 and 500 inclusive. The value of `_` is still 4.
