To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least 2 characters, since `range(len(a) - 1)` needs to have at least one iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `cut` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 0**
