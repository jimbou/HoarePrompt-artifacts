Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `cut` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still consists of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2, and the current values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are still '1' and '0', respectively. The stdin still contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500.
