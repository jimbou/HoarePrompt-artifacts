Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `cut` is either 2 or 3, and `_` is either unchanged or 2**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
