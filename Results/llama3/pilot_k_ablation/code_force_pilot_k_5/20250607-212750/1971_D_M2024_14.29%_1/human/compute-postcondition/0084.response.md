The code prints the value of `cut` plus 1, where `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`, plus 1.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is 3, and `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` plus 1 is being printed**
