To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 3
* `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive (no change)

The other variables mentioned in the state (`a`, `cut`, `stdin`, `i`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` plus 1 is being printed**
