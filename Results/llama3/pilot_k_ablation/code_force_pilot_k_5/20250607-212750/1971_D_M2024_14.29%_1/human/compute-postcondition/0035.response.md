The value of `cut` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cut` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `cut` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 3 and `cut` is increased by 1.
