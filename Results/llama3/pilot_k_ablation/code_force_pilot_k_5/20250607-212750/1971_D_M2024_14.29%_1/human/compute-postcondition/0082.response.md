Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is 3, and `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t`, `a`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now the last index of the string `a`. The value of `cut` is the total number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string `a`.
