The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, i is len(a) - 1, and the number of cuts plus one is being printed, where the number of cuts is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a**
