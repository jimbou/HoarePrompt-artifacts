The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` has length at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have length at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 1 and `_` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `cut` and `_` remain unchanged.**
