The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 4 characters.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is at least 4, and `_` is 3. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `cut` is either 1 or 2.**
