To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`**
