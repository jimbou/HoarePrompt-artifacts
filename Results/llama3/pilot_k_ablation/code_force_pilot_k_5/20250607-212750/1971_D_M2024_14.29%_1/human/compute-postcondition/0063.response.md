The code prints the value of `cut` plus 1, where `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. The string `a` consists of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500. The value of `cut` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.

Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, and i is len(a) - 1, and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a plus 1 is being printed**
