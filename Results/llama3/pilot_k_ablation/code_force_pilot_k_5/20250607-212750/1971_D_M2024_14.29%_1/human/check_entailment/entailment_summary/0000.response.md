Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight is that the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into a sorted binary string is equal to the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string, plus one. This is because each occurrence of '1' followed by '0' represents a "cut" that needs to be made in the string, and the final piece will always be a sorted substring (either all '0's or all '1's).

The program correctly counts the number of occurrences of '1' followed by '0' in each string and adds one to the count before printing the result. This ensures that the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the string into a sorted binary string is always reported.

Correctness: **True**
