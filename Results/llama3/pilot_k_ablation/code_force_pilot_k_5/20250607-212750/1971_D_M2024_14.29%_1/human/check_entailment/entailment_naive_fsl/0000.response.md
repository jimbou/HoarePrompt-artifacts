Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string and increments the `cut` variable whenever it encounters a transition from '1' to '0'. This is because each such transition requires a cut to separate the '1' and '0' into different pieces. Finally, it prints `cut + 1`, which is the minimum number of pieces needed.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the string is already sorted (e.g., "00000000" or "1"), it correctly outputs 1.
* When the string has multiple transitions from '1' to '0' (e.g., "11010"), it correctly outputs the minimum number of pieces needed.
* When the string has only one transition from '1' to '0' (e.g., "10"), it correctly outputs 2.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
