Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `cut` to 0, which will count the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string.
4. It iterates over the string, checking each pair of adjacent characters. If it finds a '1' followed by a '0', it increments the `cut` variable.
5. After iterating over the entire string, it prints the value of `cut + 1`.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If a binary string is already sorted, there will be no occurrences of '1' followed by '0', so `cut` will be 0, and the program will print 1, which is correct.
* If a binary string is not sorted, the minimum number of cuts required to sort it is equal to the number of times '1' is followed by '0' plus 1. This is because each cut can be used to swap a '1' with a '0' that follows it, and the final cut can be used to move the remaining '1's to the end of the string.

The program correctly implements this logic, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
