#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges, then performs a binary search to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of the number of nodes by a given non-negative integer plus 1, such that a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) is false. The function prints this integer, which represents the maximum size of a subset of nodes that can be removed from the graph without disconnecting it.

    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the first return values of dfs(node, y) for all unvisited nodes in g[x] where the first return value is less than y. r is the original value of r plus the sum of the second return values of dfs(node, y) for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where the first return value of dfs(node, y) is greater than or equal to y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on the number of nodes and their relationships. The value c represents 1 plus the sum of the first return values of DFS for unvisited nodes in the subtree rooted at x, where the first return value is less than a given non-negative integer y. The value r represents the sum of the second return values of DFS for all nodes in the subtree rooted at x, plus the number of nodes in the subtree where the first return value of DFS is greater than or equal to y. The function modifies the visited set by adding the nodes it visits.

        #The program returns True
    #State: *x is a positive integer, visited is an empty set, k is a positive integer, ans and r are the values returned by the dfs function when called with arguments 1 and x. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns False.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given condition is met by performing a depth-first search (DFS) and returns True if the condition is satisfied, otherwise returns False. The function takes no arguments but uses external variables x and k, and modifies the state of a set called visited.
