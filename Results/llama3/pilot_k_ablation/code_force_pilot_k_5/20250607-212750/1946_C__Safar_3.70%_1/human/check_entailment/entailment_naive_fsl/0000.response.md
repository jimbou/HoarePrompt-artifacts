Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

n = 4, k = 1
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]

The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The reason is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the tree is a chain of nodes. In this case, removing one edge will result in two connected components of size 2, but the program will incorrectly return 2 as the maximum size.

The issue is in the `check` function, which does not correctly handle the case when the tree is a chain of nodes. The `dfs` function returns the size of the subtree rooted at the current node, but it does not take into account the case when the subtree is a chain of nodes. As a result, the `check` function will incorrectly return True for sizes that are not achievable.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the tree is a chain of nodes. One possible solution is to add a special case in the `check` function to handle this case.
