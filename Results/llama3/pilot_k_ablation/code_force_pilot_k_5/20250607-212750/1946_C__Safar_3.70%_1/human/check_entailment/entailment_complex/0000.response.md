Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `dfs`, and `check`. The `func_1` function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges and performs a binary search to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of the number of nodes by a given non-negative integer plus 1, such that a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) is false. The function prints this integer, which represents the maximum size of a subset of nodes that can be removed from the graph without disconnecting it.

The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on the number of nodes and their relationships.

The `check` function determines whether a given condition is met by performing a depth-first search (DFS) and returns True if the condition is satisfied, otherwise returns False.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum size of a subset of nodes that can be removed from the graph without disconnecting it. The `check` function is used to check if a given size x is valid, and the `dfs` function is used to perform the depth-first search.

The program correctly implements the binary search approach and the depth-first search algorithm. The `check` function correctly checks if a given size x is valid, and the `dfs` function correctly performs the depth-first search.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
