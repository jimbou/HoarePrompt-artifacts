Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Annotated Functions:
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        edges.append((a, b))
    if i == 325:
        print(n, k, edges)
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers (a, b) such that 1 <= a, b <= n and a != b.
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, and g is a list of n+1 lists where each list at index i contains all the nodes j such that (i, j) is in edges.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: l is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of n by k plus 1 such that check(l-1) is false, and r is l-1, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, g is a list of n+1 lists where each list at index i contains all the nodes j such that (i, j) is in edges, c is 0, visited is an empty set.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: l-1 (where l is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of n by k plus 1 such that check(l-1) is false)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges, then performs a binary search to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of the number of nodes by a given non-negative integer plus 1, such that a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) is false. The function prints this integer, which represents the maximum size of a subset of nodes that can be removed from the graph without disconnecting it.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, and visited is a set of visited nodes.
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all nodes in g[x], c is 1 plus the sum of the first return values of dfs(node, y) for all unvisited nodes in g[x] where the first return value is less than y, r is the original value of r plus the sum of the second return values of dfs(node, y) for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where the first return value of dfs(node, y) is greater than or equal to y.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the first return values of dfs(node, y) for all unvisited nodes in g[x] where the first return value is less than y. r is the original value of r plus the sum of the second return values of dfs(node, y) for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where the first return value of dfs(node, y) is greater than or equal to y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on the number of nodes and their relationships. The value c represents 1 plus the sum of the first return values of DFS for unvisited nodes in the subtree rooted at x, where the first return value is less than a given non-negative integer y. The value r represents the sum of the second return values of DFS for all nodes in the subtree rooted at x, plus the number of nodes in the subtree where the first return value of DFS is greater than or equal to y. The function modifies the visited set by adding the nodes it visits.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, visited is a set, k is a positive integer, and dfs is a function that takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values.
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: *x is a positive integer, visited is an empty set, k is a positive integer, ans and r are the values returned by the dfs function when called with arguments 1 and x. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns False.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given condition is met by performing a depth-first search (DFS) and returns True if the condition is satisfied, otherwise returns False. The function takes no arguments but uses external variables x and k, and modifies the state of a set called visited.
