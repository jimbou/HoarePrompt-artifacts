This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on the number of nodes and their relationships. The value c represents 1 plus the sum of the first return values of DFS for unvisited nodes in the subtree rooted at x, where the first return value is less than a given non-negative integer y. The value r represents the sum of the second return values of DFS for all nodes in the subtree rooted at x, plus the number of nodes in the subtree where the first return value of DFS is greater than or equal to y. The function modifies the visited set by adding the nodes it visits.
