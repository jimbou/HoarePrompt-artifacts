Output State: **`x` is a node in the tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `g[x]` contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x` and `node`, `node` is the second unvisited node in `g[x]`, `ans` is the result of `dfs(node, y)`, `r` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r` is increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The tree structure, the set of visited nodes, and the result of the dfs function call remain the same.
