Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third unvisited node in g[x] before the code execution. If node is not in visited, then the result of the dfs function with arguments node and y is stored in ans and rn. If ans is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1 from the previous value which is equal to rn. Otherwise, r is increased by rn and c is increased by ans.***
