Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the first return values of dfs(node, y) for all unvisited nodes in g[x] where the first return value is less than y. r is the original value of r plus the sum of the second return values of dfs(node, y) for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where the first return value of dfs(node, y) is greater than or equal to y.**
