Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, and `mid` is the average of `l` and `r`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been updated to be one more than the average of `l` and `r`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still maintained, with `r` being greater than or equal to the new value of `l`.
