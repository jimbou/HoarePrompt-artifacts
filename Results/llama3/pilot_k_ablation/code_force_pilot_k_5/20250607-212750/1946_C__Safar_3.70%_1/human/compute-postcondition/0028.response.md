The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and list  g[x], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the g[x].  If the list has at least 2 unvisited nodes the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, g[x] has at least 2 unvisited nodes, node is the second unvisited node in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 unvisited nodes and the node is the third unvisited node in the list.
State: **x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 2 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third unvisited node in g[x]**
