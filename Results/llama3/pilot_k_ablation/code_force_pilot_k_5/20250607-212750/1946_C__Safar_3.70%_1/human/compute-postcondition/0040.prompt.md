Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, g is a list of n+1 lists where each list at index i contains all the nodes j such that (i, j) is in edges, c is 0, visited is an empty set, l is 1, r is the integer division of n by k plus 1
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    if check(mid):
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        r = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set. If `check(mid)` returns True, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is the integer division of `n` by `k` plus 1. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `r` is the integer division of `mid+l` by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is the integer division of `l + r` by 2, if `check(mid)` returns True, then `mid` must be less than or equal to the integer division of `n` by `k`, otherwise `mid` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `check(mid)` returns True, then `l` is the integer division of `l + r` by 2 plus 1. Otherwise, `r` is one less than `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is the integer division of `l + r` by 2. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is greater than `mid`, and `r` is either one less than `mid` or `r` is greater than or equal to `mid`. If `check(mid)` is false, then `l` is either the integer division of `l + r` by 2 plus 1 or `l` is less than or equal to `mid` and `r` is one less than `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` and `r` are updated based on the result of `check(mid)`. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `r` remains either one less than `mid` or greater than or equal to `mid`. If `check(mid)` is false, then `r` is set to one less than `mid` and `l` remains either the integer division of `l + r` by 2 plus 1 or less than or equal to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. Otherwise, `r` is `mid - 1`. In both cases, `mid` is the average of `l` and `r`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
