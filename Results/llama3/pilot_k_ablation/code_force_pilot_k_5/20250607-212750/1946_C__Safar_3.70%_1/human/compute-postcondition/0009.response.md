Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] is not empty, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If the first node in g[x] has not been visited, then visited is updated to include this node. If the first return value of dfs(node, y) is greater than or equal to y, then r is the original value of r plus the return value of dfs(node, y) plus 1. Otherwise, r is the original value of r plus the return value of dfs(node, y), and c is 1 plus the first return value of dfs(node, y). If the first node in g[x] has been visited, then no changes are made.***
