Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third unvisited node in g[x] before the code execution, ans is the result of the dfs function with arguments node and y, rn is the return value of the dfs function with arguments node and y. If ans is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1 from the previous value which is equal to the return value of the dfs function with arguments node and y. Otherwise, r is increased by the return value of the dfs function with arguments node and y and c is increased by the result of the dfs function with arguments node and y.***
