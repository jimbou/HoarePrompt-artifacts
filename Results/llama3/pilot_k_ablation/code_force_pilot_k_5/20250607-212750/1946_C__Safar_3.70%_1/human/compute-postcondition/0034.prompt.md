Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, c is 1, r is 0
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node not in visited:
        ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
        r += rn
        if ans >= y:
            r += 1
        else:
            c += ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] is not empty, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If the first node in g[x] has not been visited, then visited is updated to include this node. If the first return value of dfs(node, y) is greater than or equal to y, then r is the original value of r plus the return value of dfs(node, y) plus 1. Otherwise, r is the original value of r plus the return value of dfs(node, y), and c is 1 plus the first return value of dfs(node, y). If the first node in g[x] has been visited, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least one more unvisited node, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If the next unvisited node in g[x] has not been visited, then the visited set is updated to include this node, and the result of dfs(node, y) is computed. If the result is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1. Otherwise, c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y). If the next unvisited node in g[x] has already been visited, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and node, node is the second unvisited node in g[x]. If node is not in visited, then ans is the result of dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1. Otherwise, r is increased by rn which is the second returned value of dfs(node, y), and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y).

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 2 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If the third unvisited node in g[x] has not been visited, then the result of dfs(node, y) is calculated. If the result is greater than or equal to y, r is increased by 1 plus the return value of dfs(node, y). Otherwise, r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y) and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y).

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third unvisited node in g[x] before the code execution. If node is not in visited, then the result of the dfs function with arguments node and y is stored in ans and rn. If ans is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1 from the previous value which is equal to rn. Otherwise, r is increased by rn and c is increased by ans.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
