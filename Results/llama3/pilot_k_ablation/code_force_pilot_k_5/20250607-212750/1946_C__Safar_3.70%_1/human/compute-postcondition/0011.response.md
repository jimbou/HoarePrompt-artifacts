Output State: **x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least one more unvisited node, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and node, node is the next unvisited node in g[x], ans is the result of dfs(node, y), r is the value of r plus rn, rn is the number of nodes visited by dfs(node, y).**

In this output state, the values of x, y, and g remain unchanged. The set of visited nodes, visited, now includes node in addition to x. The next unvisited node in g[x] is still node. The value of ans is the result of the dfs function called with node and y as arguments. The value of r is incremented by rn, which is the number of nodes visited by the dfs function.
