Output State: **x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 2 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and node, node is the third unvisited node in g[x], ans is the result of dfs(node, y), r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y)**

In this output state, the values of x, y, g, visited, and node remain unchanged from the initial state. The function dfs(node, y) is executed, and its result is assigned to ans. The return value of dfs(node, y) is added to r, increasing its value.
