Output State: **x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third unvisited node in g[x] before the code execution, ans is the result of the dfs function with arguments node and y, r is increased by 1 from the previous value which is equal to the return value of the dfs function with arguments node and y, rn is the return value of the dfs function with arguments node and y.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of r is increased by 1 from its previous value which was equal to the return value of the dfs function with arguments node and y. The values of the other variables are not affected.
