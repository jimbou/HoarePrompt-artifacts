The value of `c` is increased by `ans`, where `ans` is the result of `dfs(node, y)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a node in the tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `g[x]` contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x` and `node`, `node` is the second unvisited node in `g[x]`, `ans` is the result of `dfs(node, y)`, `r` is increased by `rn` which is the second returned value of `dfs(node, y)`, and `c` is increased by the result of `dfs(node, y)`.**
