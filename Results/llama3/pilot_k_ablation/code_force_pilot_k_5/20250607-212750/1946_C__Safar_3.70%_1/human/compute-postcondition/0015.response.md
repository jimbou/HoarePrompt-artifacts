Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least one more unvisited node, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If the next unvisited node in g[x] has not been visited, then the visited set is updated to include this node, and the result of dfs(node, y) is computed. If the result is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1. Otherwise, c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y). If the next unvisited node in g[x] has already been visited, then no changes are made.***
