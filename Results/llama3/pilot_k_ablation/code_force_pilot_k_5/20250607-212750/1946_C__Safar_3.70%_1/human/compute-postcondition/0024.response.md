Output State: **`x` is a node in the tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `g[x]` contains at least 2 unvisited nodes, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x`, `node` is the third unvisited node in `g[x]`, `ans` is the result of `dfs(node, y)`, `r` is increased by 1 plus the return value of `dfs(node, y)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r` is increased by 1, in addition to the return value of the function `dfs(node, y)`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being a node in the tree, `y` being a non-negative integer, `g` being the adjacency list representation of the tree with `g[x]` containing at least 2 unvisited nodes, `visited` being a set of visited nodes containing `x`, `node` being the third unvisited node in `g[x]`, and `ans` being the result of `dfs(node, y)`.
