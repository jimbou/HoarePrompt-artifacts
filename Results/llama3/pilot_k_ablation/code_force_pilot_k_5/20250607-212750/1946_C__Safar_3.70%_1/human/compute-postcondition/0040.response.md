Output State: **l is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of n by k plus 1 such that check(l-1) is false, and r is l-1, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, g is a list of n+1 lists where each list at index i contains all the nodes j such that (i, j) is in edges, c is 0, visited is an empty set.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing, and the values of l and r have converged to a point where check(l-1) is false. The value of l is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of n by k plus 1 that satisfies this condition, and r is one less than l. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
