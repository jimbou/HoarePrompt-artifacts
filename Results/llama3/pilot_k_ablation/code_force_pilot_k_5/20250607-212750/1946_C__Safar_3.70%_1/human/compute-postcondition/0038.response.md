Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` and `r` are updated based on the result of `check(mid)`, `r` is `mid - 1`, and `mid` is the average of `l` and `r`**.

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be one less than the current value of `mid`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still maintained, with `r` being greater than or equal to `l`. The value of `mid` is still the average of `l` and `r`, but its value has not been explicitly updated in this code snippet.
