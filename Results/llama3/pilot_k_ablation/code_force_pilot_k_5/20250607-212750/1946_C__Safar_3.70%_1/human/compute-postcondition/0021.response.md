Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 1 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and node, node is the second unvisited node in g[x]. If node is not in visited, then ans is the result of dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, then r is increased by 1. Otherwise, r is increased by rn which is the second returned value of dfs(node, y), and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y).***
