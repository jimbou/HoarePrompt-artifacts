Output State: **`x` is a node in the tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `g[x]` contains at least 2 unvisited nodes, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x` and `node`, `node` is the third unvisited node in `g[x]`, `ans` is the result of `dfs(node, y)`, `r` is increased by the return value of `dfs(node, y)`, `c` is increased by the result of `dfs(node, y)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been updated by adding the result of the `dfs` function called with `node` and `y` as arguments. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being a node in the tree, `y` being a non-negative integer, `g` still representing the tree with `g[x]` containing at least 2 unvisited nodes, `visited` still containing `x` and `node`, `node` still being the third unvisited node in `g[x]`, `ans` still being the result of `dfs(node, y)`, and `r` still being increased by the return value of `dfs(node, y)`.
