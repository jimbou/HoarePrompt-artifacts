Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least one more unvisited node, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and node, node is the next unvisited node in g[x], ans is the result of dfs(node, y), r is the value of r plus rn, rn is the number of nodes visited by dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, r is increased by 1. Otherwise, c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y).***
