Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree where g[x] contains at least 2 unvisited nodes, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and node, node is the third unvisited node in g[x], ans is the result of dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, r is increased by 1 plus the return value of dfs(node, y). Otherwise, r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y) and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y).***
