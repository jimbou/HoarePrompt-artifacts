Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that `(i, j)` is in `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. Otherwise, `r` is `mid - 1`. In both cases, `mid` is the average of `l` and `r`.***
