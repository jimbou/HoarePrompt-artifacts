This function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges, then performs a binary search to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the integer division of the number of nodes by a given non-negative integer plus 1, such that a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) is false. The function prints this integer, which represents the maximum size of a subset of nodes that can be removed from the graph without disconnecting it.
