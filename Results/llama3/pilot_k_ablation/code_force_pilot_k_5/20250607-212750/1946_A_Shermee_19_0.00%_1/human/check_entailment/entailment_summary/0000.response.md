Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program first sorts the array and finds the median. Then, it calculates the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the array that are less than the median. This sum represents the total amount of increase needed to bring all elements below the median up to the median value.

However, the problem statement asks for the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array, not the total amount of increase needed to bring all elements below the median up to the median value. The correct approach would be to count the number of elements that are equal to the median and need to be increased, not the sum of the differences.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
