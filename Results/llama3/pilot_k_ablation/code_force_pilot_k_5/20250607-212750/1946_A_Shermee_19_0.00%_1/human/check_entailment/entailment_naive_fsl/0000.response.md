Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of operations required to increase the median. The program calculates the total number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median, which is not the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 1. This is because we can increase the median by 1 by increasing one of the elements to 2.

A correct solution would be to find the number of elements that need to be increased to make the median greater than its current value. This can be done by finding the number of elements that are equal to the median and then adding 1 to the median index.
