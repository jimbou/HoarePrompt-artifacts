Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]` and `a[2]` are less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are less than the median but `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is and `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[2]` if `a[2]` is less than the median but `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.***
