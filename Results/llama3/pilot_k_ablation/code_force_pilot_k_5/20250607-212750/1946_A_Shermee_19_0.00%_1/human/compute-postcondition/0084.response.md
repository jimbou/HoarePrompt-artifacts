Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is `n-1`. `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median`, and the total number of operations which is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median` is being printed**
