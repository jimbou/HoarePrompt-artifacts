Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are both less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin is empty***
