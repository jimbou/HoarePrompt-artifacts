The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are both less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin is empty**
