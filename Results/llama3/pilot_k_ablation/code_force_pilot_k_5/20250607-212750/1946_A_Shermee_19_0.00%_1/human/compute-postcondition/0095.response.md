Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 2, and `operations` is either `median - a[2] + median - a[2] + median - a[2]` if `a[2]` is less than `median`, or `median - a[2] + median - a[2]` if `a[2]` is not less than `median`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, `stdin`, `_`, `t`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `operations` is updated by adding `median - a[i]` to its previous value. If the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is less than `median`, then `operations` becomes `median - a[2] + median - a[2] + median - a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` becomes `median - a[2] + median - a[2]`.
