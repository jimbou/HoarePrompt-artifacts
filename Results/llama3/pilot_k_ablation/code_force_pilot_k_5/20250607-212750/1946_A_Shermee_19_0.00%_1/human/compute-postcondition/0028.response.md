To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, which is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is not being printed. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is updated to include the difference between the median and `a[i]`.**
