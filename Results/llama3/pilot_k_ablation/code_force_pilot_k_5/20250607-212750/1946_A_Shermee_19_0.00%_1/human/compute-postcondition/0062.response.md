The `print(operations)` statement will print the total sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median.

Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the median is the middle value in the list. The `operations` variable is calculated by summing the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median.

Output: **the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list a that are less than the median**
