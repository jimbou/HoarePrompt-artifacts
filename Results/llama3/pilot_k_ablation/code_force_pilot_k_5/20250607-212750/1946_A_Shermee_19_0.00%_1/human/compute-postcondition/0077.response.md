Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 3, and `operations` is increased by `median - a[3]` if `a[3]` is less than `median`.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated based on the condition that `a[3]` is less than `median`. If this condition is true, `operations` is increased by the difference between `median` and `a[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
