Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]`, `_` is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the median and the second element of the sorted list `a` (since `i` is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
