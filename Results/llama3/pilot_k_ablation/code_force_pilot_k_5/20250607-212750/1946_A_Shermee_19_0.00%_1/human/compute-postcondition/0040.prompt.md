Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is the integer division of n by 2, median is the middle value in the sorted list a, operations is 0, stdin is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list a that are less than the median is not being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] < median:
        operations += median - a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is not being printed. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is updated to include the difference between the median and `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is updated to include the difference between the median and `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 2, plus the difference between the median and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 4, plus the difference between the median and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 6, plus the difference between the median and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
