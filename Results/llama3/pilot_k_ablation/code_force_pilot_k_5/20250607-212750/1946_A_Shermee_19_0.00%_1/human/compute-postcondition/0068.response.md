Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is `median - a[i]`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is less than the `median`.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated to be the difference between the `median` and the current value of `a[i]`, which is less than the `median`. All other variables remain unchanged.
