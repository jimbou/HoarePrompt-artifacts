Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, `stdin` is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is not being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `a`, `median_index`, and `median` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `operations` has been updated to include the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median. The `stdin` remains empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is not being printed.
