Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is the integer division of n by 2, median is the middle value in the sorted list a, operations is 0, stdin is empty, _ is increased by n+1, t is greater than _, and i is n-1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes and assigns the input integer to `n`, which is still greater than 0. The list `a` is created by mapping the input integers to a list and sorting them in ascending order. The `median_index` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2, and the `median` is assigned the middle value in the sorted list `a`. The `operations` variable is initialized to 0. The `stdin` is now empty since all inputs have been consumed. The `_` variable is increased by `n+1`, and `t` is still greater than `_`. The `i` variable remains `n-1`.
