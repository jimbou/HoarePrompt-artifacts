The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is the integer division of n by 2, median is the middle value in the sorted list a, operations is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
