Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0]`, `_` is 0, stdin is empty. The current value of `a[i]` is less than the median**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated to be equal to the difference between the median and the current value of `a[i]`, which is `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, and the median is still the middle value in the list. The current value of `a[i]` is still less than the median.
