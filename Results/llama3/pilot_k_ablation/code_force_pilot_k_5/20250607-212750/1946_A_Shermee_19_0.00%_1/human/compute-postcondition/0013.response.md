The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]` and `a[2]` are less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are less than the median but `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is and `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[2]` if `a[2]` is less than the median but `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.**
