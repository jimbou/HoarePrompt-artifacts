Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 0, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0]`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of operations is increased by the difference between the median and the first element of the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
