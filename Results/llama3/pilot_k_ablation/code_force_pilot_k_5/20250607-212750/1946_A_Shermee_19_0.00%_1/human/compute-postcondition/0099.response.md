Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 3. `operations` is either `median - a[3] + median - a[3] + median - a[3] + median - a[3]` or `median - a[3] + median - a[3] + median - a[3]` depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median` or not.***
