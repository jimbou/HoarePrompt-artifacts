Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than the `median`, then `operations` is `median - a[i]`. Otherwise, the value of `operations` remains unchanged.***
