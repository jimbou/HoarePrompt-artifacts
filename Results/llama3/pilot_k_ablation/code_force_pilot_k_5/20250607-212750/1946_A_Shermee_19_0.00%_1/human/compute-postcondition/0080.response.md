Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 4, and `operations` is increased by `median - a[4]`**.

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the `median` and the value at index `i` (which is 4) in the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `operations` is now equal to its previous value plus `median - a[4]`.
