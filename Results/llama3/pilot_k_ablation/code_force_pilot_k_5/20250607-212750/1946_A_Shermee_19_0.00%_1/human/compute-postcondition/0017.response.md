Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is updated by adding the difference between the median and `a[3]` to the previous value of `operations`, `_` is 0, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` is updated based on the condition that `a[i]` is less than the median. Since `i` is 4, `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`. The previous value of `operations` is updated by adding the difference between the median and `a[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
