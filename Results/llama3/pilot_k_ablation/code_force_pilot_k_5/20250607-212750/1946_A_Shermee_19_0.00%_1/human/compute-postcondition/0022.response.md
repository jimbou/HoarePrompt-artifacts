The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to the sum of `median - a[j]` for all `j` where `a[j]` is less than the median, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, stdin is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is being printed**
