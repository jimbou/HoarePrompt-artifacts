The `print(operations)` statement will print the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the sorted list `a` that are less than the median.

Since `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, it represents the index of the middle value in the sorted list `a`. The `median` is the value at this index.

The `operations` variable is calculated by summing up the differences between the `median` and all elements `a[j]` that are less than the median. This means that `operations` represents the total amount by which the elements less than the median need to be increased to reach the median.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of these differences, which is a measure of how much the elements less than the median need to be increased to reach the median.

Output: **the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the sorted list `a` that are less than the median**
