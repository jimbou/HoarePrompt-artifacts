To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer greater than 0, we can focus on `i`.

For the loop to execute, `i` should be within the range of `n`. Since `i` is currently `n-1`, it is already within the range. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 0**
