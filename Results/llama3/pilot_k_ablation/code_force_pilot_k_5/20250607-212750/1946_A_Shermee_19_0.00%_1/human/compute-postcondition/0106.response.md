Output State: **`_` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to the sum of `median - a[j]` for all `j` where `a[j]` is less than the median, stdin is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed `t` times, and after the last iteration, the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, and `operations` have the same values as they did after the first iteration. The only difference is that the loop counter `_` is now equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The input from stdin has been fully consumed, and the final output is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median.
