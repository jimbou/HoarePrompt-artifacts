The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `t` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, `stdin` is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median which is `operations` is being printed, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`**
