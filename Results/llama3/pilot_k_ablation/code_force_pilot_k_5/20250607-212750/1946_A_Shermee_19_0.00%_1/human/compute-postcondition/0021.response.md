Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to the sum of `median - a[j]` for all `j` where `a[j]` is less than the median, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is being printed**
