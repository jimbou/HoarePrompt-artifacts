Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[2] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[2] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[2] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` and `a[2]` are less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are less than the median but `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is and `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[3]` if `a[3]` is less than the median but `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are not. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the median and the value of `a` at index `i` (which is 3). The value of `operations` now depends on the values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` relative to the median.
