Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is increased by `median - a[1]`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the median of the list `a` and the second element of the list `a` (since `i` is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
