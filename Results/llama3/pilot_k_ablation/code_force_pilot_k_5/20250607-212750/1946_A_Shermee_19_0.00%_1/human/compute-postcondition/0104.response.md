The `print(operations)` statement will print the total number of operations, which is the sum of the differences between the median and each element in the list `a` that is less than the median.

Since `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, and `i` is `n-1`, the elements in the list `a` that are less than the median are the elements at indices `0` to `median_index - 1`.

The value of `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median`. This means that `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and each element in the list `a` that is less than the median.

Therefore, the `print(operations)` statement will print the total number of operations, which is the sum of the differences between the median and each element in the list `a` that is less than the median.

Output: **the sum of the differences between the median and each element in the list a that is less than the median**
