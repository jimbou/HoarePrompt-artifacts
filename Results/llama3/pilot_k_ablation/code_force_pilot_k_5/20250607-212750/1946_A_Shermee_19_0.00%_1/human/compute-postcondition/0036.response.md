Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 4, plus the difference between the median and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 4.***
