Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 1, and `operations` is equal to `median - a[1] + median - a[1]` if `a[i]` is less than `median`, otherwise `operations` is equal to `median - a[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated based on the condition that if the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`, then `operations` is equal to `median - a[1] + median - a[1]`, otherwise `operations` remains equal to `median - a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
