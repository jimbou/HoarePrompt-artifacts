Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It calculates the median of each list, then computes the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list that are less than the median. The function prints this sum for each test case, effectively measuring the total amount of increase needed to bring all elements below the median up to the median value.**
