Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median plus the difference between the median and the current value of `a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than the median, otherwise `operations` remains the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of `n` integers, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 1**.

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated to include the difference between the median and the current value of `a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than the median. The other variables remain unchanged.
