Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 4, `operations` is either `median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4]` or `median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4]` depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median` or not.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the median and the current value of `a[i]`. The value of `operations` now depends on whether the current value of `a[i]` is less than the median or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
