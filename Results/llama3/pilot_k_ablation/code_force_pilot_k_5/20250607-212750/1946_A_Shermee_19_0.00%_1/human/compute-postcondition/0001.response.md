To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable, but we'll consider its state as the iteration count).

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, but we can still infer its state. Since the loop will execute `t` times, the value of `_` will range from 0 to `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` integers, `_` is 0**
