The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 3, plus the difference between the median and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 3.**
