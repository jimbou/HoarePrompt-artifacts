Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 4, plus the difference between the median and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median up to index `i`, where `i` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the median and the element at index `i` (which is 3) in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `operations` is still dependent on whether `a[2]` is less than the median, but now it considers elements up to index `i`, which is 4.
