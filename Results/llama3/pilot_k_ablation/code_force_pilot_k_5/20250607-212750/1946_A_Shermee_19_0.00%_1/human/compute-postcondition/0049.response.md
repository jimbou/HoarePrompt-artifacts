To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median plus the difference between the median and the current value of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than the median, otherwise `operations` remains the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of `n` integers, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 1**
