Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median plus the difference between the median and the current value of `a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than the median, otherwise `operations` remains the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, plus the difference between the median and the value of `a[2]` if `a[2]` is less than the median, otherwise `operations` remains the same, plus the difference between the median and the value of `a[3]`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of `n` integers, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `operations` is increased by the difference between the median and the value of `a[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `operations` now includes the difference between the median and the value of `a[3]` in addition to its previous value.
