Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is the integer division of n by 2, median is the middle value in the sorted list a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by n+1, t is greater than _, i is n-1, and operations is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] < median:
        operations += median - a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`, then `operations` is equal to `median - a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`, then `operations` is equal to `median - a[1] + median - a[1]`. Otherwise, `operations` is equal to `median - a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`, then `operations` is equal to `median - a[2] + median - a[2] + median - a[2]`. Otherwise, `operations` is equal to `median - a[2] + median - a[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 3. `operations` is either `median - a[3] + median - a[3] + median - a[3] + median - a[3]` or `median - a[3] + median - a[3] + median - a[3]` depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 4. If `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` is `median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4]`. Otherwise, `operations` is `median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4] + median - a[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
