Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` integers
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    median = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < median:
            operations += median - a[i]
    print(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to the sum of `median - a[j]` for all `j` where `a[j]` is less than the median, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, `stdin` is empty, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median which is `operations` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of `n` integers, `_` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is `n-1`, and the sum of the differences between the median and all elements in the list `a` that are less than the median which is equal to `operations` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is `n-1`. `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median`, and the total number of operations which is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is the integer division of n by 2, median is the middle value in the sorted list a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by n+1, t is greater than _, and i is n-1. operations is the sum of median - a[i] for all i where a[i] is less than median, and the total number of operations which is the sum of median - a[i] for all i where a[i] is less than median is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
