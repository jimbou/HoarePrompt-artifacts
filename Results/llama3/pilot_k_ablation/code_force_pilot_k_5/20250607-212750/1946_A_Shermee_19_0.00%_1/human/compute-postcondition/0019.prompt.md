Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is the integer division of n by 2, median is the middle value in the sorted list a, operations is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] < median:
        operations += median - a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median, otherwise `operations` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are both less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]` and `a[2]` are less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[1]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are less than the median but `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is and `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[2]` if `a[2]` is less than the median but `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[2]` is less than the median, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[2]` if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all less than the median, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[2] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[2] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` and `a[2]` are less than the median but `a[1]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[1] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` are less than the median but `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[1] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` is not less than the median but `a[1]` is and `a[2]` is not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[0] + median - a[3]` if `a[0]` is less than the median but `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[3]` if `a[3]` is less than the median but `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are not. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is updated by adding the difference between the median and `a[3]` to the previous value of `operations`. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is updated by adding the difference between the median and `a[3]` to the previous value of `operations`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
