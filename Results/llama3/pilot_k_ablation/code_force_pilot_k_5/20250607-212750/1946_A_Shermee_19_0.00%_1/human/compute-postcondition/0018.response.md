Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`. If `a[i]` is less than the median, `operations` is updated by adding the difference between the median and `a[3]` to the previous value of `operations`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged. `_` is 0, stdin is empty.***
