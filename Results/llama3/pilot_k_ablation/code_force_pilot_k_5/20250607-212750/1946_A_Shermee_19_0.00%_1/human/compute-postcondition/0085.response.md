The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is increased by `n+1`, and `t` is greater than `_`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is increased by `n+1` and `t` is greater than `_`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2, `median` is the middle value in the sorted list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by `n+1`, `t` is greater than `_`, and `i` is `n-1`. `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median`**
