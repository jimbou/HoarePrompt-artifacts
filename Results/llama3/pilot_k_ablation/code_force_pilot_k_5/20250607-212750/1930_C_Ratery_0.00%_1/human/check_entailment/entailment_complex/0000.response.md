Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.
3. It creates a set `st` to store the elements of the form `arr[i] + i + 1`. This is done to ensure that each element in the set is unique, as required by the problem statement.
4. The program then prints the elements of the set in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.

The program correctly implements the problem statement, which requires finding the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed by selecting elements from the original array `a` and adding their indices plus one.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem statement, such as the range of values for `n` and the elements of `arr`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
