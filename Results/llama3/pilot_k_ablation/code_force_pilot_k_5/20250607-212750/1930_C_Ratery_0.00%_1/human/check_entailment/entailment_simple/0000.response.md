Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
3. It creates an empty set `st` to store the unique elements.
4. It iterates over the array `arr` and adds each element `arr[i]` plus its index `i` plus 1 to the set `st`. This is equivalent to the operation described in the problem statement.
5. After adding all elements to the set, it prints the elements of the set in decreasing order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.

The program correctly implements the problem statement and produces the lexicographically largest `b` that Stack can make.

Correctness: **True**
