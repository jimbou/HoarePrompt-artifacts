Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. It takes the input array `arr` and adds each element to a set `st` along with its index plus one. This ensures that each element in the set is unique, as required by the problem description. The program then sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements.

The key insight here is that the program is not trying to find the lexicographically largest `b` by selecting the largest possible elements from the array, but rather by ensuring that each element in the set is unique and then sorting the set in descending order. This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that the set can only contain unique elements, and it ensures that the resulting array `b` is lexicographically largest.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
