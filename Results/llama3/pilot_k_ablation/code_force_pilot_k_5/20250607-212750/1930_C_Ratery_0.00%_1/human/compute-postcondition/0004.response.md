Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing two elements which are `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been updated to include a new element which is `arr[1] + 2`. The value of `i` remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `arr` also remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
