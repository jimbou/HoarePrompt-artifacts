Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, st is an empty set, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which is the length of the array `arr`. The array `arr` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The set `st` is empty, as no elements have been added to it. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been processed by the code.
