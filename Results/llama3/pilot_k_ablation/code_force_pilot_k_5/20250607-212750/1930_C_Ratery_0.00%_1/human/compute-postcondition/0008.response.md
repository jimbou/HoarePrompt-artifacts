Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing four elements which are `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, `arr[2] + 3`, and `arr[3] + 4`, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5. The list `arr` also remains the same, containing `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. The set `st` now contains four elements: `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, `arr[2] + 3`, and the newly added element `arr[3] + 4`. The value of `i` is still 3. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
