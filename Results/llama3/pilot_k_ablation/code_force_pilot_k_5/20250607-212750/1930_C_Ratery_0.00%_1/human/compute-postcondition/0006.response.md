Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing three elements which are `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, and `arr[2] + 3`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been updated to include a new element `arr[2] + 3`, which is the result of adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
