The code prints the elements of the set `st` in descending order.
Since `st` is a set containing `n` elements which are `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, ..., `arr[n-1] + n`, the elements of `st` are the sums of the corresponding elements in the list `arr` and their 1-based indices.
The `sorted` function sorts these elements in descending order, and the `*` operator unpacks the sorted list into separate arguments to the `print` function.
Therefore, the output will be the elements of `st` in descending order, separated by spaces.
Output: **arr[n-1] + n, arr[n-2] + (n-1), ..., arr[0] + 1 (where arr[i] is the ith element of the list arr and n is the number of elements in the list arr)**
