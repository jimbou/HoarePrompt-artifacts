Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing five elements which are `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, `arr[2] + 3`, `arr[3] + 4`, and `arr[4] + 5`, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer between 4 and 3 * 10^5. The list `arr` also remains the same, containing `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. The set `st` now contains five elements: `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, `arr[2] + 3`, `arr[3] + 4`, and the newly added element `arr[4] + 5`. The value of `i` is still 4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
