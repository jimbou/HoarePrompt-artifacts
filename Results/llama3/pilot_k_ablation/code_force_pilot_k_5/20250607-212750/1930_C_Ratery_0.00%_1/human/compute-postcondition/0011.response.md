Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing `n` elements which are `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, ..., `arr[n-1] + n`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same range for `n` and the same range of values for the elements in `arr`. The set `st` will contain `n` unique elements, each being the sum of the corresponding element in `arr` and its 1-based index plus one. The loop variable `i` will be one less than `n`, and the state of `stdin` remains unchanged.
