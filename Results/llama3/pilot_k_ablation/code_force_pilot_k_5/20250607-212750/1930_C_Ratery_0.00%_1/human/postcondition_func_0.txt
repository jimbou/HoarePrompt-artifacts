This function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains the length of an array and the second line contains the array elements. It then creates a set of elements by adding the index plus one to each array element, and finally prints the elements of the set in descending order. The function processes one test case at a time, and it assumes that multiple test cases are provided in the standard input.
