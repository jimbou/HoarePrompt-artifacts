Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2. If the third digit of `a` is equal to the third digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both increased by the value of the third digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string that starts with the value of `x` and `kq2` is a string that starts with the value of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string that ends with the digit `y` and `kq2` is a string that ends with the digit `x`.***
