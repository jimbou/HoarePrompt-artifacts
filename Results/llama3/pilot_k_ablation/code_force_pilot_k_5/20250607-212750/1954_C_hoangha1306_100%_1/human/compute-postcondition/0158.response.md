Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `q` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the first digit of `a` is equal to the first digit of `b`, then `i` is 2, `kq1` is the first digit of `a` plus the second digit of `a`, and `kq2` is the first digit of `a` plus the second digit of `a`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and if `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the smaller of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the larger of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`. If `vt` is not 0, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`.**
