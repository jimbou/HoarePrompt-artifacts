Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 0, kq1 and kq2 are printed. If the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, then kq1 and kq2 are both equal to the first digit of a. Otherwise, if vt is 0, then kq1 contains the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 contains the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 contains the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 contains the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `q` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the first digit of `a` is equal to the first digit of `b`, then `i` is 2, `kq1` is the first digit of `a` plus the second digit of `a`, and `kq2` is the first digit of `a` plus the second digit of `a`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and if `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the smaller of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the larger of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`. If `vt` is not 0, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith digit of a is equal to the ith digit of b, then i is either 1 or 4, kq1 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If the ith digit of a is not equal to the ith digit of b, then x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is 0, then i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then i is either 1 or 4 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Additionally, vt is updated to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith digit of a is equal to the ith digit of b, then i is either 1 or 5, kq1 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If the ith digit of a is not equal to the ith digit of b, then x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is 0, then i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then i is either 1 or 5 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Additionally, vt is updated to 1. If vt was originally 0, then kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the smaller and larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the larger and smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith digit of a is equal to the ith digit of b, then i is either 1 or 5, kq1 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If the ith digit of a is not equal to the ith digit of b, then x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is 0, then i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then i is either 1 or 5 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Additionally, vt is updated to 1. If vt was originally 0, then kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the smaller and larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the larger and smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively, i is 4, x is the smaller of the ith digit of a and the ith digit of b, y is the larger of the ith digit of a and the ith digit of b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
