Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `x` is the minimum of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 4. The new variables `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum values of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`, respectively.
