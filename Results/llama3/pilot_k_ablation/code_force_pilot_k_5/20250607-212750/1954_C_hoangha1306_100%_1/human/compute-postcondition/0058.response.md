Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and the character at index `i` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string containing the minimum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the maximum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `kq1` and `kq2` are not printed.***
