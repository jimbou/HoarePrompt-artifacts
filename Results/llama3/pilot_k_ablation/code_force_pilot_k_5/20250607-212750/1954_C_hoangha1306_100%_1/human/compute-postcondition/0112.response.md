Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If the second digit of a is equal to the second digit of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings that include the second digit of a. Otherwise, if vt is 0, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b.***
