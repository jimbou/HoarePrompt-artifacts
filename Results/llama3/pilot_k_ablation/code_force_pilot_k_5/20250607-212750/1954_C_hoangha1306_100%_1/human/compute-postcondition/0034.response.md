Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 3. If the 4th digit of `a` is equal to the 4th digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are the original values plus the 4th digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the 4th digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 4th digit of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` starts with `x`, and `kq2` starts with `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value plus the string representation of `x`.***
