Functionality: This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t pairs of strings a and b, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and having the same length. It then generates two new strings, kq1 and kq2, by comparing each pair of corresponding digits in a and b. If the digits are the same, it appends the digit to both kq1 and kq2. If the digits are different, it appends the smaller digit to kq1 and the larger digit to kq2, or vice versa, depending on whether the current position is even or odd. Finally, it prints kq1 and kq2 for each pair of input strings.
