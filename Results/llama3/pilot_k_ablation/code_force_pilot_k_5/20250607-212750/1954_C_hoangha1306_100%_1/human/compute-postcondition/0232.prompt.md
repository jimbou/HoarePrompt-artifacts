Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq2 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 1, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq2 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that must have the same length as a, and vt is 1 if the length of a is odd, otherwise vt is 0, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq2 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed, and kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq2 is a string of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
