Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `x` is the smaller of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, `y` is the larger of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by comparing the first digits of `a` and `b`. The smaller of the two digits is assigned to `x`, and the larger of the two digits is assigned to `y`. The stdin still contains a string of digits from 1 to 9 as input.
