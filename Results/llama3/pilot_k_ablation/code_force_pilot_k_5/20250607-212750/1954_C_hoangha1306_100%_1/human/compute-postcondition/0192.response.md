Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `x` is the smaller of the digits at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the digits at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, and the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, `kq2`, and `vt` remain the same as in the initial state. The only changes are the introduction of new variables `x` and `y`, which are assigned the smaller and larger of the digits at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a string of digits from 1 to 9. The condition that the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b` still holds true.
