Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are empty strings and have not been printed. The character at index `i` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `b`. `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`. The current value of `vt` is 0.**
