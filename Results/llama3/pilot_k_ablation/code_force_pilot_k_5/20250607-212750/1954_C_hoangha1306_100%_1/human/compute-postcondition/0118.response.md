Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `x` is the smaller of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, `y` is the larger of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. Additionally, if `vt` is 0, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, otherwise `stdin` is empty and `vt` is 1.**
