Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is equal to 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before, `x` is the smaller of the digits at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the digits at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to be the smaller and larger of the digits at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
