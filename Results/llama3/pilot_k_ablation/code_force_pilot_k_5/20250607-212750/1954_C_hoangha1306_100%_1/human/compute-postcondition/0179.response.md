Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If vt is 0, then i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, vt is 1, x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then i is either 1 or 5 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Additionally, vt is updated to 1. If vt was originally 0, then kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the smaller and larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the larger and smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively, i is 4, x is the smaller of the ith digit of a and the ith digit of b, y is the larger of the ith digit of a and the ith digit of b.**
