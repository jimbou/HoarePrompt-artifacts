Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 plus the digit at index 3 of string `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` and `kq2` have one more digit than before. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 with the larger of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 with the smaller of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b` appended to it. `vt` is 1.**
