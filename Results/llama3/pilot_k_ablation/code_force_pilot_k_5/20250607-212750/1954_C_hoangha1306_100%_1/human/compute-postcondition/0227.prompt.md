Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 2 inputs: a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed, and kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before. If the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then x is the smaller of the digits at index i of strings a and b, y is the larger of the digits at index i of strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the smaller of the digits at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string consisting of the larger of the digits at index i of strings a and b, and vt is 1. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the larger digit at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string containing the smaller digit at index i of strings a and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a and is equal to 1, kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before, x is the smaller of the digits at index i of strings a and b, y is the larger of the digits at index i of strings a and b, vt is 1. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then the program executes without any changes to the variables when vt is not equal to 0. Otherwise, the program executes without any changes to the variables when vt is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before. Otherwise, if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 have the same values as before. If vt is not 0, kq1 ends with the larger of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b, and kq2 ends with the smaller of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b. x is the smaller of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b, y is the larger of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b, vt is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 plus the digit at index 3 of string `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` and `kq2` have one more digit than before. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 with the larger of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 with the smaller of the digits at index 3 of strings `a` and `b` appended to it. `vt` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 4. If the 5th digit of `a` is equal to the 5th digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that are one digit longer than their original lengths. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` starts with the value of `x`, and `kq2` starts with the value of `y`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`, and stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
