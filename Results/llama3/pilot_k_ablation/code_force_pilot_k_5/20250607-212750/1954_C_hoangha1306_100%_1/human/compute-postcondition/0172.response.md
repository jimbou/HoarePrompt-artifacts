Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, i is either 1 or 5 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, vt is 1. If vt was originally 0, then kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the smaller and larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the larger and smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively.***
