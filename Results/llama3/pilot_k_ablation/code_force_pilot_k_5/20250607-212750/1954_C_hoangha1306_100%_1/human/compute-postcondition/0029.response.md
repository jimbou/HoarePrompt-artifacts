Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 3, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the 4th digit of a, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the 4th digit of a.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line appends the 4th digit of string `a` to `kq1`. The second line appends the 4th digit of string `a` to `kq2`. The third line is a `continue` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Since `i` is 3, the 4th digit of `a` is used in the first two lines. The original values of `kq1` and `kq2` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values after the code executes. However, we can express their values in terms of their original values and the 4th digit of `a`. 

The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
