Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 3. If the 4th digit of `a` is equal to the 4th digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that have been appended with the 4th digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the 4th digit of `a` and the 4th digit of `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the 4th digit of `a` and the 4th digit of `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` starts with the value of `kq1` and ends with the value of `x`, `kq2` starts with the value of `kq2` and ends with the value of `y`, and `vt` is 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.***
