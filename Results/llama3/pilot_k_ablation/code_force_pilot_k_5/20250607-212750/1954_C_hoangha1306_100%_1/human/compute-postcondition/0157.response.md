Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If vt is 0, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. In both cases, x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b.***
