Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the third digit of a, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the third digit of a.**

Explanation: The first line appends the third digit of `a` to `kq1`. The second line appends the third digit of `a` to `kq2`. The `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The `stdin` is empty after the code execution because no input is read from it. The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `kq1` and `kq2` are updated by appending the third digit of `a` to their original values.
