Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a and is equal to 1, kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before, x is the smaller of the digits at index i of strings a and b, y is the larger of the digits at index i of strings a and b, vt is 1. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then the program executes without any changes to the variables when vt is not equal to 0. Otherwise, the program executes without any changes to the variables when vt is not equal to 0.**
