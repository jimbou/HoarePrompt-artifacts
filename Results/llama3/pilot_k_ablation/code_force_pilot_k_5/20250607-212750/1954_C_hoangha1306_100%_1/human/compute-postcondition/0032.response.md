Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 3, x is the minimum of the 4th digit of a and b, y is the maximum of the 4th digit of a and b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.**

The code appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1` and the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
