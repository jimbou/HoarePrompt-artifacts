To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1. Additionally, we can initialize `q` to 0, as it will be the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length**
