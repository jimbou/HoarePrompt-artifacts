Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are the original values of `kq1` and `kq2` plus the ith digit of `a`, respectively. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string with the minimum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b` appended to its original value, `kq2` is a string with the maximum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b` appended to its original value, and `vt` is 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string that is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string that is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.***
