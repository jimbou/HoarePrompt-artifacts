Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string that starts with the value of x and kq2 is a string that starts with the value of y. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that ends with the digit y and kq2 is a string that ends with the digit x.***
