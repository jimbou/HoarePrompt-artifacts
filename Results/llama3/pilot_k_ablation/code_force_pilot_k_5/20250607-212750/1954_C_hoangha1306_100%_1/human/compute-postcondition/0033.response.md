Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 3, x is the minimum of the 4th digit of a and b, y is the maximum of the 4th digit of a and b. If vt is 0, then vt is set to 1, kq1 is a string that starts with the minimum of the 4th digit of a and b, and kq2 is a string that starts with the maximum of the 4th digit of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.***
