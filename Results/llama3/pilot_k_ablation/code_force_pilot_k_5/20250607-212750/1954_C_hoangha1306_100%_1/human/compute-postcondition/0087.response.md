Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 1, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is greater than or equal to 5. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the original values of kq1 and kq2 plus the ith digit of a, respectively, and vt remains unchanged. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the integer at index i in strings a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i in strings a and b. If vt is 0, then vt is set to 1, kq1 is a string that starts with the string value of the minimum of the integer at index i in strings a and b, and kq2 is a string that starts with the string value of the maximum of the integer at index i in strings a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string that is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.***
