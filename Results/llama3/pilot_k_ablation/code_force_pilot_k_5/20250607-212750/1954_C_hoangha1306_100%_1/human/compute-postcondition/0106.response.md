The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` has at least 1 digit. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 2 digits.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 1**
