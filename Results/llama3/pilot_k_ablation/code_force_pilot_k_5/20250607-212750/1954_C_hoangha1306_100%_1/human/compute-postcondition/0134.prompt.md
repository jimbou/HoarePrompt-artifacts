Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, stdin contains 2 inputs: a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is not defined, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, kq1 is not printed, and kq2 is not printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` is a string containing the first digit of `a`, `kq2` is a string containing the first digit of `a`, and `vt` is 0. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b` respectively, and `vt` is 1 if `vt` was 0, otherwise `vt` is not equal to 0. In all cases, `kq1` and `kq2` are not printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If the second digit of a is equal to the second digit of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings that include the second digit of a. Otherwise, if vt is 0, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2. If the second digit of `a` is equal to the second digit of `b`, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the third digit of `a`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the third digit of `a`, and `stdin` is empty. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of the smaller of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of the larger of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `stdin` contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of the larger of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of the smaller of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `stdin` is empty and `vt` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 3. If the 4th digit of `a` is equal to the 4th digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that have been appended with the 4th digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the 4th digit of `a` and the 4th digit of `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the 4th digit of `a` and the 4th digit of `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` starts with the value of `kq1` and ends with the value of `x`, `kq2` starts with the value of `kq2` and ends with the value of `y`, and `vt` is 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 4. If the 5th digit of a is equal to the 5th digit of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b, y is the maximum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b. If vt is 0, then vt is updated to 1, kq1 is a string that starts with the value of kq1 before the code execution and ends with the minimum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b, and kq2 is a string that starts with the value of kq2 before the code execution and ends with the maximum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string that includes the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string that includes the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
