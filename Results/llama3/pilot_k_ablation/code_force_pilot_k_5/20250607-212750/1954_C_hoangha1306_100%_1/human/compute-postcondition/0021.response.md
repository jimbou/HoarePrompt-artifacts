The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 digits. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have at least 3 digits.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2**
