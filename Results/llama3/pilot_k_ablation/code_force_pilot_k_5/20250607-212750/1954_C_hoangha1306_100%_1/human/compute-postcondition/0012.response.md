Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and a[i] is not equal to b[i]. If vt is 0, kq1 is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and vt is 1. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and vt is not equal to 0.***
