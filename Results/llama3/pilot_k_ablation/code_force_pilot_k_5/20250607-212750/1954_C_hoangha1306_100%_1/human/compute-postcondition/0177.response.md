Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith digit of a is equal to the ith digit of b, then i is either 1 or 5, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, vt is 1, x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b.**
