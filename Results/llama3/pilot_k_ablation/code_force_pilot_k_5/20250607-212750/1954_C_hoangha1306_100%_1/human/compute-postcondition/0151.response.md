Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 0, kq1 and kq2 are printed. If the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, then kq1 and kq2 are both equal to the first digit of a. Otherwise, if vt is 0, then kq1 contains the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 contains the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 contains the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 contains the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b.***
