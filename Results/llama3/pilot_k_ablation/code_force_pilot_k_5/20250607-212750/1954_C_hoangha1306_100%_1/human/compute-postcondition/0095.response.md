According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 digit the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9. So for the loop to be executed  the string `a` must have at least 1 digit and the index `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains 2 inputs: a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `kq1` is not printed, and `kq2` is not printed**
