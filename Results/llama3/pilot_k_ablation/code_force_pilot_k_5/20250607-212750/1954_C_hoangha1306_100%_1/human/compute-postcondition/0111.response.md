Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, q is 2, i is 1, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9. If vt is 0, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y.***
