Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 1, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is greater than or equal to 2, x is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index i in strings a and b, y is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index i in strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string that includes the string representation of y appended to its original value, and kq2 is a string that includes the string representation of x appended to its original value.***
