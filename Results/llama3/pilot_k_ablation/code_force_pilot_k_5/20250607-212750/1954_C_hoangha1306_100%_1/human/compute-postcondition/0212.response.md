Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before. Otherwise, if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 have the same values as before. If vt is not 0, kq1 ends with the larger of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b, and kq2 ends with the smaller of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b. x is the smaller of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b, y is the larger of the digits at index 2 of strings a and b, vt is 1.***
