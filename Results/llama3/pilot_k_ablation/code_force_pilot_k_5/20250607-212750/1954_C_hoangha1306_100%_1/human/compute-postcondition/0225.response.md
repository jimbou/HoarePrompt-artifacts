Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `q` is 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `x` is the minimum of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 5th digit of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` is a string that starts with the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string that starts with the value of `y`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`, and stdin is empty.**
