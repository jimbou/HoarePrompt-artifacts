Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 4, q is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9 that have 1 more digit than before. If the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then x is the smaller of the digits at index i of strings a and b, y is the larger of the digits at index i of strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the smaller of the digits at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string consisting of the larger of the digits at index i of strings a and b, and vt is 1. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the larger digit at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string containing the smaller digit at index i of strings a and b.***
