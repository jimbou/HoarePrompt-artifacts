Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 4, x is the minimum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b, y is the maximum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that includes the maximum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b, and kq2 is a string that includes the minimum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b.***
