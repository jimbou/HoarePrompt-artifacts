Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2. If the second digit of `a` is equal to the second digit of `b`, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the third digit of `a`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the third digit of `a`, and `stdin` is empty. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of the smaller of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of the larger of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `stdin` contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of the larger of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of the smaller of the second digit of `a` and the second digit of `b`, and `stdin` is empty and `vt` is 1.***
