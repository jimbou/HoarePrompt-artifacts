Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the value of `y` is now the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The `stdin` now contains `t-2` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
