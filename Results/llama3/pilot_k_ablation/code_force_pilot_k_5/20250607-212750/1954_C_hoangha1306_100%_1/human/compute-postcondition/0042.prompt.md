Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 is a string containing the ith digit of a, kq2 is a string containing the ith digit of a, and vt is 0. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and if vt is 0, kq1 is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and vt is 1. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and vt is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then stdin is empty, kq1 is a string containing the ith digit of a, kq2 is a string containing the ith digit of a, and vt is 0. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i]. If vt is 0, then kq1 is kq1 + str(y) and kq2 is kq2 + str(x). Otherwise, vt is 1, kq1 is kq1 + str(x), and kq2 is kq2 + str(y).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2. If the third digit of `a` is equal to the third digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both increased by the value of the third digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string that starts with the value of `x` and `kq2` is a string that starts with the value of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string that ends with the digit `y` and `kq2` is a string that ends with the digit `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 3. If the 4th digit of `a` is equal to the 4th digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are the original values plus the 4th digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the 4th digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 4th digit of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` starts with `x`, and `kq2` starts with `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value plus the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 4. If the 5th digit of a is equal to the 5th digit of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings that include the digit at index 4 of a. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b, and y is the maximum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that includes the maximum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b, and kq2 is a string that includes the minimum of the 5th digit of a and the 5th digit of b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
