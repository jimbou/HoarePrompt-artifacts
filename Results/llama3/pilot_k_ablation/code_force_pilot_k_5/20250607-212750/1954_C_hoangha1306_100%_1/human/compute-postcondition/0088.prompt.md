Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 1, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, kq1 is not printed, and kq2 is not printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the digit at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string containing the minimum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the maximum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `kq1` and `kq2` are not printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the digit at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string containing the minimum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the maximum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `kq1` and `kq2` are not printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 3. If the ith digit of `a` is equal to the ith digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings ending with the ith digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the ith digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the ith digit of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are the original values of `kq1` and `kq2` plus the ith digit of `a`, respectively. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string with the minimum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b` appended to its original value, `kq2` is a string with the maximum of the integer at index `i` in strings `a` and `b` appended to its original value, and `vt` is 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string that is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string that is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 1, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is greater than or equal to 5. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the original values of kq1 and kq2 plus the ith digit of a, respectively, and vt remains unchanged. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the integer at index i in strings a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i in strings a and b. If vt is 0, then vt is set to 1, kq1 is a string that starts with the string value of the minimum of the integer at index i in strings a and b, and kq2 is a string that starts with the string value of the maximum of the integer at index i in strings a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string that is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
