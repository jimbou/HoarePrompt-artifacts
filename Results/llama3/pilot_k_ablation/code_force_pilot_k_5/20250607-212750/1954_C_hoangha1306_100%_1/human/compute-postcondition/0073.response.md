Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 3. If the ith digit of `a` is equal to the ith digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings ending with the ith digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the ith digit of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the ith digit of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`.***
