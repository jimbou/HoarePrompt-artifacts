Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `q` is 3, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `kq1` is printed, and `kq2` is printed. Additionally, the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. `x` is the smaller of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`, and `y` is the larger of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`. The current value of `vt` is 0.**
