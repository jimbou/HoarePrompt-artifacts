Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the digit at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string containing the minimum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the maximum digit at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b`, and `kq1` and `kq2` are not printed.**
