Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` is a string containing the first digit of `a`, `kq2` is a string containing the first digit of `a`, and `vt` is 0. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b` respectively, and `vt` is 1 if `vt` was 0, otherwise `vt` is not equal to 0. In all cases, `kq1` and `kq2` are not printed.**
