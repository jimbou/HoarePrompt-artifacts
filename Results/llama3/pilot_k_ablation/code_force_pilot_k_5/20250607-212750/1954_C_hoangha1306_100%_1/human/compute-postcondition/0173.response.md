Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, stdin is empty, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 5 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith digit of a is equal to the ith digit of b, then i is either 1 or 5, kq1 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, kq2 is either the first digit of a plus the second digit of a plus the ith digit of a, or the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, or the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If the ith digit of a is not equal to the ith digit of b, then x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is 0, then i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then i is either 1 or 5 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Additionally, vt is updated to 1. If vt was originally 0, then kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the smaller and larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are updated by adding the string representation of the larger and smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b respectively.***
