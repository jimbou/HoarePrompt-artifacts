Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, q is 3, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 4 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, x is the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, y is the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is 0, then i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. If vt is not 0, then i is either 1 or 4 depending on whether the first digit of a is equal to the first digit of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of the larger of the first digit of a and the first digit of b, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of the smaller of the first digit of a and the first digit of b. Additionally, vt is updated to 1.***
