Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, kq1 is the value of kq1 plus the third digit of a, kq2 is the value of kq2 plus the third digit of a**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line adds the third digit of string `a` to the value of `kq1`. The second line adds the third digit of string `a` to the value of `kq2`. The third line is a `continue` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Since `i` is 2, the third digit of `a` is used in the first two lines. The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not changed by the code. The values of `kq1` and `kq2` are updated by adding the third digit of `a`.
