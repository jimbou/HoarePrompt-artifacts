Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are determined by the minimum and maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are still not equal, as specified in the initial state.
