The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**
