The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 3, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the slice of a starting from index 2, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of a starting from index 2 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3**
