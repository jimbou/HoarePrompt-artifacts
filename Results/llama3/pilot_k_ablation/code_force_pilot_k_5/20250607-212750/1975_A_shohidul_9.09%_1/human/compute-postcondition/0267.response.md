Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 3, new is a list of integers starting from index 3 of a, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The new variables `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all` are introduced and assigned values based on the operations performed in the code. The `new` variable is assigned a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3), `check_all` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, and `new_all` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in ascending order.
