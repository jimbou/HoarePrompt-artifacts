Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 3, new is a list of integers starting from index 3 of a, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the innermost loop or if statement.
