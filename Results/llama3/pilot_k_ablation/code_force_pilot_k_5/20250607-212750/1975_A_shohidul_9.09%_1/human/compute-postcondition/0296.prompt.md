Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then a subset of a starting from index 2 is checked. If all elements in this subset are less than a[0] and the subset is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 3. If a[i - 1] > a[i], the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether all elements in the list starting from index 3 of a are less than a[0] and whether the list is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer greater than 4, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 4. If a[3] is greater than a[4], a subset of a starting from index 4 is checked. If all elements in this subset are less than a[0] and the subset is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. In any case, the innermost loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer greater than 5, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 5. If the element at index i-1 in list a is greater than the element at index i, a new list new is created as a slice of a starting from index 5. Then, two boolean values check_all and new_all are calculated. check_all is true if all elements in new are less than the first element in a, and new_all is true if new is sorted in ascending order. If both check_all and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed. Regardless of the values of check_all and new_all, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the element at index i-1 in list a is not greater than the element at index i, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
