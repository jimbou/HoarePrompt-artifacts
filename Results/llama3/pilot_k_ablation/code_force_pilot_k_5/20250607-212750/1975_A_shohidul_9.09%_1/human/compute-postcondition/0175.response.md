Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `check_all` is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, `new_all` is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a`, the index `i`, the number `n`, the boolean variables `check_all` and `new_all`, and the sublist `new` remain unchanged. The program still prints 'NO'. However, the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
