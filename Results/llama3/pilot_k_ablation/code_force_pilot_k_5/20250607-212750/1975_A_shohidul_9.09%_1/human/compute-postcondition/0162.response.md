Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `check_all` is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, `new_all` is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i`, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
