Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` are in increasing order, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either `check_all` is false or `new_all` is false, and 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new_all`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, either `check_all` is false or `new_all` is false, and the string 'NO' is printed.
