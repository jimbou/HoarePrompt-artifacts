Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, check_all is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then check_all is False, and 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, check_all remains True, and if all elements in a are in increasing order, then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], a sublist of a starting from index 2 is checked. If all elements in this sublist are less than a[0] and the sublist is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 3, a is a list of integers, i is 3, if a[2] is greater than a[3], then new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order, and either 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when check_all and new_all are true, or 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when check_all and new_all are not true, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 4, a is a list of integers, i is 4. If a[3] is greater than a[4], then new is a slice of list a starting from index 4, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. Either 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when check_all and new_all are true, or 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when check_all and new_all are not true. If check_all and new_all are true, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 5. If the element at index `i-1` in `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, then a new list `new` is created from index 5 to the end of `a`. Two boolean values `check_all` and `new_all` are determined based on whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]` and whether `new` is sorted in ascending order, respectively. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed. In any case, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the element at index `i-1` in `a` is not greater than the element at index `i`, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
