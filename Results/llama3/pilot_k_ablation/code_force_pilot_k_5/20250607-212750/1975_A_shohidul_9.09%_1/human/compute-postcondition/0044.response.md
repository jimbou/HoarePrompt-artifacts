Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `new` is a slice of list `a` starting from index 4, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in ascending order, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. Additionally, 'YES' has been printed.
