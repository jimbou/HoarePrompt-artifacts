Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 3, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 3 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
