Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of integers from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, and either `check_all` is false or `new_all` is false, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, and `new_all` remain the same as before. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is printed. The relationship between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` is still valid, and either `check_all` or `new_all` is still false.
