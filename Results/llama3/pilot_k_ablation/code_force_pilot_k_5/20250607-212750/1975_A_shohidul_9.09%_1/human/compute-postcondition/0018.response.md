Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, new is a sublist of a starting from index 1, and new_all is True. If check_all is True and new_all is True, then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
