Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 5. If the element at index `i-1` in `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, then a new list `new` is created from index 5 to the end of `a`. Two boolean values `check_all` and `new_all` are determined based on whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]` and whether `new` is sorted in ascending order, respectively. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed. In any case, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the element at index `i-1` in `a` is not greater than the element at index `i`, no action is taken.***
