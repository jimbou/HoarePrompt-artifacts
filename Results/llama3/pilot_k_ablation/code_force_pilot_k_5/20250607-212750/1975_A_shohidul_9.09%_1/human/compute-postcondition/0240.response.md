Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no input**.

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Then, it assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line checks if all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order by comparing each element with its previous one. The result of this check is assigned to `check_all`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that it now contains no input.
