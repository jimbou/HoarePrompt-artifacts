The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 5**
