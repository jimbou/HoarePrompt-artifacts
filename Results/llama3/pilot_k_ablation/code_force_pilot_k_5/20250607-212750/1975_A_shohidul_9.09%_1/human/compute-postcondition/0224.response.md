Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 4, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their previous values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
