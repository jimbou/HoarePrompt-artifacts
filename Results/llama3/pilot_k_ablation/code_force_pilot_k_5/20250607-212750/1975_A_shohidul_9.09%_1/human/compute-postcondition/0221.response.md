Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 4, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value. The value of `n` is still an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 4. The value of `a` is still a list of integers equal to the second input. The value of `check_all` is still a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4. The value of `new_all` is still a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `i` is still 4. The value of `new` is still a sublist of `a` starting from index 4. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
