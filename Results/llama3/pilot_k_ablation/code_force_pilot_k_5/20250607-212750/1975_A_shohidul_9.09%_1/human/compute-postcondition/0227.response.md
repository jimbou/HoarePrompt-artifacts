The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 5, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 5. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
