Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1, `new_all` is True, and 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. However, the value of `check_all` is now False, indicating that the condition to check all elements is no longer true. Additionally, we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, which may affect the control flow of the program. The program is still printing 'YES', and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
