Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index i, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of a starting from index i are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `check_all` is updated to indicate whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `i`. The value of `new_all` is updated to indicate whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` are in increasing order. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
