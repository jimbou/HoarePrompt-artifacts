To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 5.

State: **n is an integer greater than 5, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 5**
