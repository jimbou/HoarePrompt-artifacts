Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then a subset of a starting from index 2 is checked. If all elements in this subset are less than a[0] and the subset is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.***
