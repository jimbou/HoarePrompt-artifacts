Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.***
