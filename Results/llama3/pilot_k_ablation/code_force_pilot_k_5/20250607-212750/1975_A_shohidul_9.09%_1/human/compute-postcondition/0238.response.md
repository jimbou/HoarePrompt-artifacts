Postcondition: **The program prints 'YES' if all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order or if the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` and all elements in the sublist are in increasing order. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' if the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` but not all elements in the sublist are in increasing order, or if `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]` and not all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order. The state of the variables remains unchanged if `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]` and all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order.**
