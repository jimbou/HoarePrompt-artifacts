Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 5, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 5 are in increasing order, `i` is 5, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new_all`, `i`, and `new` remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
