Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 2, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 2 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2, new is a sublist of a starting from index 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `check_all` is updated to indicate whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 2. The value of `new_all` is updated to indicate whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 are in increasing order. The value of `new` is assigned the sublist of `a` starting from index 2. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
