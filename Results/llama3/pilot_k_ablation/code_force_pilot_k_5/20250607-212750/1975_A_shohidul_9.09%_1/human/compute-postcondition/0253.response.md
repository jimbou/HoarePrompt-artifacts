Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of integers from index `i` to the end of list `a`, `new_all` is a boolean value, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `t`, `i`, `new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. The condition that either `check_all` is False or `new_all` is False is still valid, and 'NO' is still being printed.
