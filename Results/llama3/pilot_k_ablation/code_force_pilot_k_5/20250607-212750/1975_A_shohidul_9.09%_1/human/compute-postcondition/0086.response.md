Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `new_all` remain the same as before. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The value of `i` is still 2, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by two. The program has also printed 'NO'.
