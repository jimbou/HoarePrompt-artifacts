To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables `a`, `check_all`, and `new_all` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `check_all` is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, `new_all` is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order**
