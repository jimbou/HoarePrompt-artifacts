Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 4, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
