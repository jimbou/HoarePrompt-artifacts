Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of integers equal to the slice of `a` from index `i` to the end, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value. The value of `n` is still an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1. The value of `a` is still a list of integers equal to the second input. The value of `check_all` is still a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order. The value of `i` is still 1. The value of `new` is still a list of integers equal to the slice of `a` from index `i` to the end. The value of `new_all` is still a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
