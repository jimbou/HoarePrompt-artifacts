To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**
