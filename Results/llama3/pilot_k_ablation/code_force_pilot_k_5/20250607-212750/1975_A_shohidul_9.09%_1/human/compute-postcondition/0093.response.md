Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2 are in increasing order, `i` is 3, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new_all`, `i`, and `new` retain their previous values, and 'YES' is still being printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
