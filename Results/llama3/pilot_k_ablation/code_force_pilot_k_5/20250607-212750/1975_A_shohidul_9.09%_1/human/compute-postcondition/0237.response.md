Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index n, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of a starting from index n are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is equal to n. If a[i - 1] is greater than a[i], then if both check_all and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the variables have reached their final state. The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is still an integer equal to the first input, and `a` is still a list of integers equal to the second input. The value of `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `n`, and the value of `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` are in increasing order. The value of `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus two, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then if both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.
