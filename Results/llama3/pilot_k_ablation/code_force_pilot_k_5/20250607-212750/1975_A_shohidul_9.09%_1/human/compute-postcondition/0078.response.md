Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 1, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if both check_all and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
