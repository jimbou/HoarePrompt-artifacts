Postcondition: **If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, then the program checks if `check_all` and `new_all` are both true. If they are, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If the element at index `i-1` is not greater than the element at index `i`, the program does nothing.**
