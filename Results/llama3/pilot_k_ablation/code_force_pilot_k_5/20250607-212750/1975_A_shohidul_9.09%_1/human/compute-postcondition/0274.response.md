Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 3, new is a list of integers starting from index 3 of a, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether check_all and new_all are true or false.***
