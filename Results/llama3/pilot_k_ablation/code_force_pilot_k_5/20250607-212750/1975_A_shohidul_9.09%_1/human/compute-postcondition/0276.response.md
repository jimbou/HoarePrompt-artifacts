To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is already greater than 3, it remains the same.

The other variables `a`, `t` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 4**
