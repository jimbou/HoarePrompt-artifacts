Postcondition: ***a is a list, i is 3, n is greater than 3, check_all is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, new_all is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i], new is a sublist of a starting from index i. If check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.***
