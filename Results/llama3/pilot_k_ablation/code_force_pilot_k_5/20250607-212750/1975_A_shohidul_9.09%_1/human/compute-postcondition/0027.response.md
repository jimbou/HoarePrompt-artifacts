Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether `new` is sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
