The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
