Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is equal to n if check_all is false
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then if `check_all` and `new_all` are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all` or `new_all` is false, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 2, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 2 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if both check_all and new_all are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 3, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of a starting from index 3 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 4. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 5, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 5, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 5, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 5 are in increasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
