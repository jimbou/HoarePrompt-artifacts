Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 5, a is a list of integers, i is 5, new is a list of integers from index 5 to the end of a, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. If check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' has been printed. In any case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
