Postcondition: ***a is a list, i is 2, n is greater than 2, check_all is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, new_all is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
