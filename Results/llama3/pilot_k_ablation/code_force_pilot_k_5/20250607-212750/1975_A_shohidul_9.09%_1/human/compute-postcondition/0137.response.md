Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` is created from the slice of `a` from index `i` to the end, and a boolean value `new_all` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited without printing anything.***
