Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 3. If a[i - 1] > a[i], the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether all elements in the list starting from index 3 of a are less than a[0] and whether the list is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
