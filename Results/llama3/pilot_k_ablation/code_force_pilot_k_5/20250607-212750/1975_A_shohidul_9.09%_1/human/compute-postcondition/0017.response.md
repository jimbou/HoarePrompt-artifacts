Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1, `new_all` is True, and either `check_all` is False or `new_all` is False, and 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `stdin`, `i`, `new`, `new_all` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition "either `check_all` is False or `new_all` is False" is still valid because `check_all` is False. 'NO' is still being printed.
