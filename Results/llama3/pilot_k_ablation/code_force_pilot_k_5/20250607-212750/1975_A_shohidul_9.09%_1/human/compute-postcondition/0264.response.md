Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 2, new is a list of integers that is a subset of a starting from index 2, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. If check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
