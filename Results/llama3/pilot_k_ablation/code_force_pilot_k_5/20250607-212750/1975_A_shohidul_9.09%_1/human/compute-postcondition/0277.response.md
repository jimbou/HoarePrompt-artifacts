Output State: **n is an integer greater than 4, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 4, new is a list of integers that is a subset of a starting from index 4, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order.**

The first line creates a new list `new` that is a subset of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 4). This does not affect the original list `a`. The second line assigns a boolean value to `check_all` indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`. The third line assigns a boolean value to `new_all` indicating whether `new` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `a`, `t`, and `i` are not modified by the code.
