Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer but less than its previous value. The value of `n` remains the same as the first input and is greater than 1. The list `a` is still equal to the second input. The boolean value `check_all` still indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3. The slice `new` is still equal to the slice of `a` starting from index 3. The boolean value `new_all` still indicates whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 are in increasing order. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by two. The value of `i` is still 3. 'YES' has been printed. We have exited the innermost loop or if statement.
