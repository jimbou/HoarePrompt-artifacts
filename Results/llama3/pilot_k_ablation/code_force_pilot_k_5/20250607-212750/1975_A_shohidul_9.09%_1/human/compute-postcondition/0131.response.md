Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is True, `new` is a list of integers equal to the slice of `a` from index `i` to the end, `new_all` is True, `i` is 1, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new`, `new_all`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
