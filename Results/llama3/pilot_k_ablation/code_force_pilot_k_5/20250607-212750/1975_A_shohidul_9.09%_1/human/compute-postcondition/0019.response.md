Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then check_all is False, and 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, check_all remains True, and if all elements in a are in increasing order, then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
