The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 4**
