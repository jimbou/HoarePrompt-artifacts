Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a space-separated list of integers (the elements of array a). The length of the list is equal to the integer. All integers are positive and less than or equal to 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If check_all is True, then 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then if all elements in a are in increasing order, 'YES' is printed. If any element in a is not in increasing order, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the first element of a is greater than all elements in the slice of a starting from index n-1, and all elements in the slice of a starting from index n-1 are in increasing order, and a[i - 1] is greater than a[i], then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If check_all is true, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, i is equal to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The program prints 'YES' if all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order or if the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` and all elements in the sublist are in increasing order. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' if the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` but not all elements in the sublist are in increasing order, or if `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]` and not all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order. The state of the variables remains unchanged if `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]` and all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no input. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then if a[i - 1] > a[i], a subset of a starting from index n - 1 is checked. If all elements in this subset are less than a[0] and the subset is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
