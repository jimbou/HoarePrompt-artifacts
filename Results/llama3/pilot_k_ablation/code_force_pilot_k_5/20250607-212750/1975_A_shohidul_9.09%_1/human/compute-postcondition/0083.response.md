Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2 are in increasing order, `i` is 2, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `new_all` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 2. The program has printed 'YES' and has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
