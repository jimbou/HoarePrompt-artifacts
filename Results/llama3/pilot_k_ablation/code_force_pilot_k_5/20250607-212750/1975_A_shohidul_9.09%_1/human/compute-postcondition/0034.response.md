Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `new` is a slice of list `a` starting from index 3, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in ascending order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, 'YES' is being printed, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
