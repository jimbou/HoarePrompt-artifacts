Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a space-separated list of integers (the elements of array a). The length of the list is equal to the integer. All integers are positive and less than or equal to 10^6.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the structure of each test case remains the same: an integer followed by a space-separated list of integers. The integers in the list are still positive and less than or equal to 10^6.
