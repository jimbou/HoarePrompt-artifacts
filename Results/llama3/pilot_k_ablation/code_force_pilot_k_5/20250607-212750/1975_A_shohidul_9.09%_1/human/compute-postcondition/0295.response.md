Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 5, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 5. If the element at index i-1 in list a is greater than the element at index i, a new list new is created as a slice of a starting from index 5. Then, two boolean values check_all and new_all are calculated. check_all is true if all elements in new are less than the first element in a, and new_all is true if new is sorted in ascending order. If both check_all and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed. Regardless of the values of check_all and new_all, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the element at index i-1 in list a is not greater than the element at index i, no action is taken.***
