Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 4, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 4. If a[3] is greater than a[4], a subset of a starting from index 4 is checked. If all elements in this subset are less than a[0] and the subset is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. In any case, the innermost loop or if statement is exited.***
