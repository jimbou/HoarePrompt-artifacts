Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 3, a is a list of integers, i is 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order, and either 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when check_all and new_all are true, or 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement when check_all and new_all are not true, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
