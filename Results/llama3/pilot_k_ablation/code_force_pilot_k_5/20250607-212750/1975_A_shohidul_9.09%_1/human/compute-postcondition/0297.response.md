Postcondition: ***n is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no input. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then if a[i - 1] > a[i], a subset of a starting from index n - 1 is checked. If all elements in this subset are less than a[0] and the subset is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.***
