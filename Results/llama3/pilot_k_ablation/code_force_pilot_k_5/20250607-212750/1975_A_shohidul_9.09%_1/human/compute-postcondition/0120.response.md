Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the first element of a is greater than all elements in the slice of a starting from index n-1, and all elements in the slice of a starting from index n-1 are in increasing order, and a[i - 1] is greater than a[i], then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
