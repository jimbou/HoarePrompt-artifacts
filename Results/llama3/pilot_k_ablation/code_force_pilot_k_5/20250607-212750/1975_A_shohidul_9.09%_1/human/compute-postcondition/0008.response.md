Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is 1 and the value of `a` at index `i-1` is greater than the value of `a` at index `i`.***
