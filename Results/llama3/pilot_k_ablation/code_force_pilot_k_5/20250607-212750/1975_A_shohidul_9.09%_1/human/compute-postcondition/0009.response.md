Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, check_all is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, new is a sublist of a starting from index 1, check_all is False, new_all is True**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as greater than 1. The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `check_all` is still False, indicating that not all elements in `a` are in increasing order. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `i` is still 1. A new variable `new` is created, which is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1. The variable `check_all` is reassigned to False, indicating that the first element of `a` is not greater than all elements in the sublist `new`. A new variable `new_all` is created and is True, indicating that all elements in the sublist `new` are in increasing order.
