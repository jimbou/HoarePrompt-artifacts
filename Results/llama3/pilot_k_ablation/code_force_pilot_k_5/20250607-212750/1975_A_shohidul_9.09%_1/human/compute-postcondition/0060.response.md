Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n+1, i is n. If a[i - 1] is greater than a[i] for any i in range(1, n), then 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i] for all i in range(1, n), then 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The list `a` also remains unchanged. The value of `stdin` is decreased by `n+1` as each iteration of the loop processes one test case. The variable `i` is equal to `n` after the loop finishes. If at any point during the loop's execution, an element in the list `a` is greater than the next one, the loop prints 'NO' and exits. If no such pair of elements is found, the loop prints 'YES' and exits.
