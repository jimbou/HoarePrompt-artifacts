Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 1, new is a list of integers from index i to the end of list a. If check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
