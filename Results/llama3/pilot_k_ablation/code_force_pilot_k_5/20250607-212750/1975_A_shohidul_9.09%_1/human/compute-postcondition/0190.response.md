Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is true indicating that the first element of a is greater than all elements in the sublist of a starting from index i, new_all is true indicating that all elements in the sublist of a starting from index i are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, new_all, stdin, and i remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed.
