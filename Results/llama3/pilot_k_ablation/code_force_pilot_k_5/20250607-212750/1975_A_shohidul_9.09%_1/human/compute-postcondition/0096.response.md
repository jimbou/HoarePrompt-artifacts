Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2 are in increasing order, `i` is 3, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new_all`, `i`, and `new` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
