Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of the array) and a space-separated list of integers (the elements of array a). It checks if the array is in increasing order. If it is, the function prints 'YES'. If not, it checks a subset of the array starting from the first decreasing element. If all elements in this subset are less than the first element of the original array and the subset is sorted in ascending order, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
