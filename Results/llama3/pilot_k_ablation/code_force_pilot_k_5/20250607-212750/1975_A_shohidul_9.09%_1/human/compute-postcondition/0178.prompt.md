Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of integers equal to the second input, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` is created from the slice of `a` from index `i` to the end, and a boolean value `new_all` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 2, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2 are in increasing order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then if `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, then the program checks if `check_all` and `new_all` are both true. If they are, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If the element at index `i-1` is not greater than the element at index `i`, the program does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *a is a list, i is 2, n is greater than 2, check_all is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, new_all is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *a is a list, i is 3, n is greater than 3, check_all is a boolean variable indicating whether all elements in the new list are less than the first element of the original list, new_all is a boolean variable indicating whether the new list is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i], new is a sublist of a starting from index i. If check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
