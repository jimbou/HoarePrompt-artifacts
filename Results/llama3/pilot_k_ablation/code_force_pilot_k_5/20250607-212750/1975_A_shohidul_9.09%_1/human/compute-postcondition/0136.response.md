Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of integers equal to the slice of `a` from index `i` to the end, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without printing anything.**
