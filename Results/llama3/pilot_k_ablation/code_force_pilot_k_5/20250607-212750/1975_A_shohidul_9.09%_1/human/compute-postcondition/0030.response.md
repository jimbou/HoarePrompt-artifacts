To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3**
