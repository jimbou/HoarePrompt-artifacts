Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], a sublist of a starting from index 2 is checked. If all elements in this sublist are less than a[0] and the sublist is sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no action is taken.***
