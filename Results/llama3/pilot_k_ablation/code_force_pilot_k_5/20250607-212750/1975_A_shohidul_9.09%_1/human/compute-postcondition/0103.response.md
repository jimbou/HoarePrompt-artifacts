Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 4, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 4 are in increasing order, `i` is 4, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new_all`, `i`, and `new` remain unchanged. The only change is that we have exited the innermost loop or if statement, and 'YES' has been printed.
