Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 5, a is a list of integers, t is greater than 1, i is 5, new is a list of integers which is a slice of a starting from index 5, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than the first element in a, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. If check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed. Regardless of the values of check_all and new_all, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
