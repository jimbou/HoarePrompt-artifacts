Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be at least 5, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second input. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 5, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 5, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the sublist of `a` starting from index 5 are in increasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
