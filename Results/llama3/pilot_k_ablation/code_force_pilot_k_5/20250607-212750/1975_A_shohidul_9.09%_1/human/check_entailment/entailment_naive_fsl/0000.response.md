Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will print 'YES' because it checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not check if the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix. In this case, the array cannot be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix, but the program still prints 'YES'. 

The program should check all possible swaps of the prefix and suffix, not just the case where the array is already sorted. 

Here is a correct version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(n):
            new = a[i:] + a[:i]
            if all([new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, n)]):
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This program checks all possible swaps of the prefix and suffix and prints 'YES' if any of them result in a sorted array, and 'NO' otherwise.
