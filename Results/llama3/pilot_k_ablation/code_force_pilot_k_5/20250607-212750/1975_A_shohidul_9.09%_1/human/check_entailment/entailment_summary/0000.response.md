Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. The program first checks if the array is already sorted, and if so, it prints 'YES'. If the array is not sorted, it finds the first pair of elements that are in decreasing order and checks if the suffix of the array (starting from the second element of the decreasing pair) is sorted and if all its elements are less than the first element of the original array. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
