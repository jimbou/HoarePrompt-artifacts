The function takes a list of distinct integers in ascending order and a list of non-negative integers as input, processes the list of integers using the func_1 function, and returns a list of strings containing the results of querying the processed list at specified indices. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases, consuming all input from stdin, and returns a list of strings containing the results of all test cases.
