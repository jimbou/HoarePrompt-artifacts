Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It meets the problem description by simulating the game for each test case and outputting the number of players declared as winners for each query.

The `func_1` function correctly computes the complement of the input list `p` with respect to the range `[1, 100]`, which represents the number of players remaining after the game is played with `n` initial players. The `func_2` function uses `func_1` to process the input list `p` and then queries the resulting list to obtain the number of players declared as winners for each query `n` in `qs`.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and consumes all input from stdin. The output format is also correct, with each test case's results printed on a separate line, separated by spaces.

Correctness: **True**
