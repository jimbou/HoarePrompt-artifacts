Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first defines a function `func_1(p)` that calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100. This function uses the `bisect` module to efficiently find the number of players that would be kicked out in each round.

2. The function `func_1(p)` initializes an array `remaining_players` of size 101 (to accommodate players from 0 to 100) and iterates over each possible initial number of players `n`. For each `n`, it simulates the game by repeatedly subtracting the number of players that would be kicked out in each round until no more players are kicked out. The final number of remaining players is stored in the `remaining_players` array.

3. The function `func_2()` reads the input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the length of the sequence `k`, the number of queries `q`, the sequence `p`, and the queries `qs`.

4. For each test case, `func_2()` calls `func_1(p)` to calculate the `remaining_players` array and then uses this array to answer each query in `qs`. The answers are stored in the `results` list.

5. Finally, `func_2()` returns the `results` list, which contains the answers to all queries in all test cases.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players and uses this information to answer each query.

Correctness: **True**
