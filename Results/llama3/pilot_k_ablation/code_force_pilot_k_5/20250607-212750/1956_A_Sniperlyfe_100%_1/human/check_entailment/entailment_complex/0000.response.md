Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. It first computes the number of remaining players for each possible number of initial players using the `func_1` function, and then uses these precomputed values to answer the queries in the `func_2` function. The program handles all the test cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
