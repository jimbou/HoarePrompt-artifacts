Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes a list of distinct integers `p` as input and returns a list `remaining_players` where each integer at index `n` represents the number of integers in the range `[1, n]` that are not in `p`. This is achieved by simulating the game for each `n` from 1 to 100 and counting the number of players that are not kicked out.

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and generates the output. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the sequence `k`, the number of queries `q`, the sequence `p`, and the queries `qs`. It then calls `func_1` to get the `remaining_players` list and uses this list to generate the output for each query.

The program correctly implements the logic of the game and generates the correct output for each query. Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
