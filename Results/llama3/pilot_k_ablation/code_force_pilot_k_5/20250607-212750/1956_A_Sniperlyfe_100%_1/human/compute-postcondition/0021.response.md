To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `cur_n` and `p`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 2 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 2 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, and `min(p)` is 1 or 2.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `cur_n` to be greater than or equal to `min(p)`. Since `min(p)` is 1 or 2, we need to adjust `cur_n` to be greater than or equal to 2.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `p` still satisfies the condition that it has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 2, `count` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`**
