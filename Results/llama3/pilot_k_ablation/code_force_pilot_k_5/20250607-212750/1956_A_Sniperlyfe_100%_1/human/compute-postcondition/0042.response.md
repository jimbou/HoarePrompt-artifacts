Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 3, cur_n is 0.**

In this output state, the value of remaining_players[3] has been updated to 0, which is the value of cur_n. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
