To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `n` and `max_n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `n` is less than `max_n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 3 and `max_n` is 100.

To execute the loop again, `n` needs to be incremented by 1, so `n` becomes 4. The value of `max_n` remains the same, which is 100.

The state of the other variables, such as `p`, `remaining_players`, and `cur_n`, does not affect the execution of the loop and therefore does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and `remaining_players[3]` is 0, `n` is 4, `cur_n` is 0**
