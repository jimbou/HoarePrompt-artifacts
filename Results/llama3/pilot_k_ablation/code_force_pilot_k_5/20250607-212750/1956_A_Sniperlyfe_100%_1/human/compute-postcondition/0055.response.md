Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list `p` has at least one element that is less than or equal to `cur_n` and at most one element that is less than or equal to 1. The value of `cur_n` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables in the precondition, `max_n`, `remaining_players`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
