The only variable in the loop head is variable  n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `max_n`. If `n` is less than `max_n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 4, `max_n` is 100. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be increased by 1, so `n` is 5.
State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, remaining_players[3] is 0, and remaining_players[4] is 0, n is 5, cur_n is 0**
