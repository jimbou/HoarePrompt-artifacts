Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and min(p) must be less than or equal to 5, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, remaining_players[3] is 0, and remaining_players[4] is 0, n is 5, cur_n is greater than or equal to a value that is less than or equal to 5 and is reduced by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to the original value of cur_n**

In this output state, the list `p` remains unchanged, with the same properties as before. The `max_n` variable also remains unchanged, still equal to 100. The `remaining_players` list remains the same, with the same values for indices 1, 2, 3, and 4. The value of `n` is still 5. The value of `cur_n` is reduced by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to its original value, which is stored in the `count` variable. The `count` variable now holds the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the original value of `cur_n`.
