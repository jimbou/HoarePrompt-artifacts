To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3.
- `max_n` is 100.
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and `remaining_players[3]` is 0.
- `n` is 4.
- `cur_n` is 4.

The loop condition depends on `cur_n` and `min(p)`. Since `cur_n` is 4, we need to ensure that `min(p)` is less than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `min(p)` is already constrained to be 1 or 2, and there's at least one element in `p` that is 3, the condition is already satisfied. No adjustments are needed to the states of `cur_n` or `min(p)` because the existing constraints on `p` (having `min(p)` as 1 or 2) already guarantee that the loop can execute at least once with `cur_n` being 4.

Therefore, no changes are required to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and `remaining_players[3]` is 0, `n` is 4, `cur_n` is 4**
