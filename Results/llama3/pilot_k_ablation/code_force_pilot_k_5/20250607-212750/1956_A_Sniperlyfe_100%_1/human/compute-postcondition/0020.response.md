Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros, n is 2, cur_n is 2 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 2 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n.**

The code snippet first calculates the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` using the `bisect.bisect_right` function and assigns this value to `count`. Then, it subtracts `count` from `cur_n`, effectively decreasing `cur_n` by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to its original value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
