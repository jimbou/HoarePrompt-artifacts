Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, qs is a list of non-negative integers, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing three strings, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers**

The code snippet first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `k` and `q`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `p`. The list `qs` is also read from the input. The function `func_1` is called with `p` as an argument, and its return value is assigned to `remaining_players`. A new list `res` is created by selecting elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified in `qs`. Finally, the string representation of `res` is appended to the `results` list.

Note that the value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains greater than 0. The initial values of `p`, `qs`, `k`, `q`, and `remaining_players` are also not modified, so they retain their initial properties. The `results` list now contains three strings, and `res` is a new list of integers.
