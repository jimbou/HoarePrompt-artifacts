Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros, n is 3, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated by subtracting the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`. This is because the `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where `cur_n` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `p`, which is equivalent to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
