To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `cur_n` and `p`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 1, and `p` has at least one element that is 1 and at most one element that is less than or equal to 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `p` so that its minimum value is less than or equal to `cur_n`. Since `p` has at least one element that is 1, we can adjust the state of `p` to have at least one element that is less than or equal to `cur_n`.

State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 1 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1**
