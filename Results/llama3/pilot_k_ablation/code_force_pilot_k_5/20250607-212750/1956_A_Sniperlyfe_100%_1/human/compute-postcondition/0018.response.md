Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros, n is 2, cur_n is 2 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 2**.

In this output state, the list `p` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The variables `max_n`, `remaining_players`, and `n` also remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The only variable that is modified is `cur_n`, which is decremented by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 2. This is because the `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the insertion point for `cur_n` in `p` to maintain sorted order, and `count` is assigned this value. Then, `cur_n` is decremented by `count`, effectively subtracting the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 2 from `cur_n`.
