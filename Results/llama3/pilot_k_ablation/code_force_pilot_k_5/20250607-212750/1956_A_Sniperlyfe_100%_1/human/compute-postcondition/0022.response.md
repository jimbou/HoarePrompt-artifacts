Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros, n is 2, cur_n is greater than or equal to 2 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated to be greater than or equal to 2 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to its original value. The value of `count` has also been updated to be the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the original value of `cur_n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
