Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros, n is 3, cur_n is 0**.

The code snippet modifies the value of `cur_n`. The first line uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to find the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, which is 3. Since `p` has at least one element that is 3, the count will be at least 1. The second line subtracts this count from `cur_n`, making it 0. No other variables are affected.
