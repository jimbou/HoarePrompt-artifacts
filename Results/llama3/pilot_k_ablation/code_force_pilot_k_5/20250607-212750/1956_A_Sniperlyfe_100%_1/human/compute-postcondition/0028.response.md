Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players[2]` has been updated to 1, which is the value of `cur_n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
