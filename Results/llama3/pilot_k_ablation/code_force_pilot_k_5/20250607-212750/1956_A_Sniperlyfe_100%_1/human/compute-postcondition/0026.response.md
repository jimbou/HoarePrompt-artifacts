Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros, n is 2, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value, and if min(p) is 2 then cur_n must be at least 2, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value.**

The code modifies the values of `count` and `cur_n`. The first line assigns the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` to `count`. The second line decrements `cur_n` by the value of `count`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
