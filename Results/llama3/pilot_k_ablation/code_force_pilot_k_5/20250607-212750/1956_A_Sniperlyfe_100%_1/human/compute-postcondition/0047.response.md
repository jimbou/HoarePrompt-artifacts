To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `cur_n` and `p`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 0, and `min(p)` is 1 or 2.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `cur_n` to be at least 1, since `min(p)` is 1 or 2. We can set `cur_n` to 1.

The state of `p` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not the bottleneck for the loop to execute again.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and `remaining_players[3]` is 0, `n` is 4, `cur_n` is 1**
