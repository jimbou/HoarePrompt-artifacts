Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, remaining_players[3] is 0, and remaining_players[4] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 0**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players[4]` has been updated to `cur_n`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
