Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and `remaining_players[3]` is 0, `n` is 4, `cur_n` is 4
Code of the loop:
while cur_n >= min(p):
    count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
    cur_n -= count


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 1 - count where count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and p has at least one element that is 1 or 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 1 - count where count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is 1 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 1 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is the original value of cur_n minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
