Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, qs is a list of non-negative integers, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing five strings, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `k` and `q`, respectively. It then reads a list of distinct integers from the input and assigns it to `p`, and a list of non-negative integers from the input and assigns it to `qs`. The function `func_1` is called with `p` as an argument, and the result is assigned to `remaining_players`. A list comprehension is used to create a new list `res` containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified in `qs`. Finally, the string representation of `res` is appended to the list `results`.

Note that the value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains greater than 0. The list `results` now contains five strings, as a new string has been appended to it. The lists `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, and `res` have been updated with new values. The variables `k` and `q` have been assigned new integer values.
