Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is greater than or equal to 1, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 1, `cur_n` is 0.**

In this output state, the list `remaining_players` has been updated such that its element at index `n` (which is 1) is now equal to `cur_n` (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
