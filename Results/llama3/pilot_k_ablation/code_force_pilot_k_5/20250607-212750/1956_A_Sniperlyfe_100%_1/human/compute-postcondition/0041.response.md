Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros, n is 3, cur_n is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 2 times. This is because the loop will continue to execute until cur_n is less than min(p), and since min(p) is 1 or 2, the loop will stop when cur_n is 0. Therefore, the final output state will have cur_n as 0, and all other variables will remain unchanged.
