To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the range of `t` is not exhausted. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

The only object in the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `t`. Since `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **p is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, qs is a list of non-negative integers, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing one string, stdin is empty, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers.**
