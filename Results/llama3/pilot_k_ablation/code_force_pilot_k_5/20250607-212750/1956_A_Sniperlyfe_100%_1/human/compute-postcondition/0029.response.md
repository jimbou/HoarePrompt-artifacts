The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is less than `max_n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2, `max_n` is 100. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be increased by 1, so `n` is 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 1**
