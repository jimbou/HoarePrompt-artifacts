Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and min(p) must be less than or equal to 5, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, remaining_players[3] is 0, and remaining_players[4] is 0, n is 5, cur_n is 0, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 5.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `p` remains unchanged, `max_n` remains 100, `remaining_players` remains unchanged, `n` remains 5, `cur_n` becomes 0, and `count` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 5.
