Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros, n is 2, cur_n is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `p` is a list of distinct integers between 1 and 100, with at most one element less than or equal to 2, and `cur_n` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
