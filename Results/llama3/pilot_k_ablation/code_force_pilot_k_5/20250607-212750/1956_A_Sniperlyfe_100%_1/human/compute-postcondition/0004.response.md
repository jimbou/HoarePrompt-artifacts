Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, qs is a list of non-negative integers, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing two strings, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers.**

The code block executes as follows: 

1. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `k` and `q`. Since stdin is empty, this line will not execute and the program will terminate. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that stdin contains two integers. 

2. The second line assigns a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, to `p`. 

3. The third line assigns a list of non-negative integers to `qs`. 

4. The fourth line assigns the result of the function `func_1(p)` to `remaining_players`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we can't determine the exact value of `remaining_players`. However, based on the name of the function, it's likely that it returns a list of integers.

5. The fifth line assigns a list of integers to `res`. The list is created by iterating over `qs` and selecting the corresponding elements from `remaining_players`.

6. The sixth line appends a string to `results`. The string is created by joining the elements of `res` with spaces.

The final state of the program is that `p` is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, `qs` is a list of non-negative integers, `t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing two strings, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `remaining_players` is a list of integers, and `res` is a list of integers.
