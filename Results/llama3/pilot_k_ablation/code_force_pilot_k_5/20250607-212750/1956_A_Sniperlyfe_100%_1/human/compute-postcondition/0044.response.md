Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and `remaining_players[3]` is 0, `n` is 4, `cur_n` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated to 4, which is the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
