According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cur_n` and `p`. If `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 0, and `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 5. Since `cur_n` is less than `min(p)`, the loop cannot execute again with the current state. To make the loop execute again, `cur_n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and `p` has at least one element that is less than or equal to `cur_n` and `p` has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 5, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1, `remaining_players[3]` is 0, and `remaining_players[4]` is 0, `n` is 5, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`, `count` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 5**
