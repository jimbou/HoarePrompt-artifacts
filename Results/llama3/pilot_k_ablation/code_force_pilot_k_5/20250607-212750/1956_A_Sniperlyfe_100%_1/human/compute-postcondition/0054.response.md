Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is the original value of cur_n minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n**

The code first calculates the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` using `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`, and assigns this count to `count`. Then, it subtracts `count` from `cur_n`, effectively decreasing `cur_n` by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
