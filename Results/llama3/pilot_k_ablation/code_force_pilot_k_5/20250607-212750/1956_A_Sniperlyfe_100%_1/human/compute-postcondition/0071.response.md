Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[n] is the number of integers in the range [1, n] that are not in p, n is 100, cur_n is the number of integers in the range [1, max_n] that are not in p.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `p` remains unchanged, the maximum value `max_n` remains 100, and the list `remaining_players` is updated to reflect the number of integers in the range [1, n] that are not in `p` for each `n` from 1 to 100. The variable `n` is updated to 100, and the variable `cur_n` is updated to the number of integers in the range [1, max_n] that are not in `p`.
