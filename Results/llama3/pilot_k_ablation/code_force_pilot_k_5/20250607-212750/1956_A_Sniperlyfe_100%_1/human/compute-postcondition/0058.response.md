Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and `p` has at least one element that is less than or equal to `cur_n` and `p` has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1, `remaining_players[3]` is 0, and `remaining_players[4]` is 0, `n` is 5, `cur_n` is 5**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `p` still contains distinct integers between 1 and 100, and it has at least one element less than or equal to the current value of `cur_n`, which is now 5. The maximum number `max_n` remains 100. The list `remaining_players` still has the same values as before. The value of `n` is still 5, and the value of `cur_n` has been updated to 5.
