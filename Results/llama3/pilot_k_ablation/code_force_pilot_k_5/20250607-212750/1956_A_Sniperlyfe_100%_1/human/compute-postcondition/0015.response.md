To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for n in range(1, max_n + 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `max_n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and `max_n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `max_n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 1, and `max_n` is 100.

For the loop to execute again, `n` needs to be incremented by 1, so `n` becomes 2. The value of `max_n` remains the same, which is 100.

The other variables, `p`, `remaining_players`, and `cur_n`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is greater than or equal to 1, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 0**
