To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`.

Given the initial state:
- `p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is greater than or equal to 1
- `max_n` is 100
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros
- `n` is 2
- `cur_n` is 2

The loop head involves `cur_n` and `min(p)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`. Since `cur_n` is 2, we need to ensure that `min(p)` is less than or equal to 2 for the loop to certainly execute at least once.

Given that `min(p)` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 1, we only need to adjust the state of `min(p)` to ensure it is less than or equal to 2. This adjustment is necessary because, as stated, `min(p)` could be any value between 1 and 100, inclusive, but for the loop to execute, it specifically needs to be 1 or 2 given the value of `cur_n`.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 2**
