The variables in the loop head are cur_n and p, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables cur_n and p. If cur_n is greater than or equal to min(p), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cur_n is 0, min(p) is 1 or 2. cur_n being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to cur_n is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros, n is 3, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1**
