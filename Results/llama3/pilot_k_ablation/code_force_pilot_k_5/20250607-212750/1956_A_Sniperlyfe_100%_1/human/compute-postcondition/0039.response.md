According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cur_n` and `p`. If `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than its original value by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, and `min(p)` is 1 or 2. Since `min(p)` is 1 or 2, `cur_n` being greater than or equal to 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is 1 or 2 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 2 and p has at least one element that is 3, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`.**
