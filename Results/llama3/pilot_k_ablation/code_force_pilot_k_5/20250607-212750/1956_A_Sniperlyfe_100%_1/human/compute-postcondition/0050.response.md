Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and p has at least one element that is 1 or 2, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and remaining_players[3] is 0, n is 4, cur_n is 1 - count where count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line uses the bisect.bisect_right function to find the insertion point for cur_n in p to maintain sorted order. This insertion point is assigned to the variable count. The second line subtracts the value of count from cur_n.

Since p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and p has at least one element that is 1 or 2, the value of count will be the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n. 

The initial value of cur_n is 1 - count where count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1. After the second line executes, cur_n will be updated to be 1 - count - count. Since count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 1, the value of cur_n will be 1 - 2 * count. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
