To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and `p` has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and `p` has at least one element that is 1 or 2.
- `max_n` is 100 (this variable is not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust it).
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1, and `remaining_players[3]` is 0 (this variable is not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust it).
- `n` is 4 (this variable is not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust it).
- `cur_n` is 1 - count where count is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 1.

The variables in the loop head are `cur_n` and `p`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 1 - count, and `p` has at least one element that is 1 or 2. Since `p` has at least one element that is 1 or 2, `min(p)` is either 1 or 2. 

If `min(p)` is 1, then `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `min(p)` is 2, then `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

However, `cur_n` is 1 - count, and count is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 1. Since `p` has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, count is either 0 or 1. 

If count is 0, then `cur_n` is 1. If count is 1, then `cur_n` is 0. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `min(p)` must be 1. 

This means that `p` must have at least one element that is 1, and `cur_n` must be 1.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and `p` has at least one element that is 1 and `p` has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1, and `remaining_players[3]` is 0, `n` is 4, `cur_n` is 1**
