Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and p has at least one element that is less than or equal to cur_n and p has at most one element that is less than or equal to 1 and min(p) must be less than or equal to 5, max_n is 100, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, remaining_players[3] is 0, remaining_players[4] is 0, remaining_players[5] is 0, n is 5, cur_n is 0, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list p remains unchanged with its properties of having distinct integers between 1 and 100, having at least one element less than or equal to cur_n, having at most one element less than or equal to 1, and having a minimum value less than or equal to 5. The max_n remains 100. The list remaining_players has been updated with remaining_players[5] now being 0. The variables n and cur_n remain unchanged at 5 and 0 respectively. The count variable remains the same, representing the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 5.
