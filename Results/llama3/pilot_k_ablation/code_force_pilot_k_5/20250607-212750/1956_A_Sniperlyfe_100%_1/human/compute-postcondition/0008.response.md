Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, qs is a list of non-negative integers, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing four strings, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers**

The code snippet executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `k` and `q`. The second line assigns a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, to `p`. The third line assigns a list of non-negative integers to `qs`. The fourth line assigns the result of the function `func_1(p)` to `remaining_players`. The fifth line assigns a list of integers to `res`, where each integer is the value at the index `n` in `remaining_players` for each `n` in `qs`. The sixth line appends a string to `results`, where the string is the concatenation of the strings in `res`, separated by spaces.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of the variables that are modified by the code. The variables `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, and `res` are updated with new values, while the variables `t` and `results` retain their original values. The list `results` now contains four strings, including the newly appended string.
