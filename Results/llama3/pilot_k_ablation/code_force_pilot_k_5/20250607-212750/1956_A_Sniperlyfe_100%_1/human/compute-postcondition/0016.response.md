Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100 and min(p) is greater than or equal to 1, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
