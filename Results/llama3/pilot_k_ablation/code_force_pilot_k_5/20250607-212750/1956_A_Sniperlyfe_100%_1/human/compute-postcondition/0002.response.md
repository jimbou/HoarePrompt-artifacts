Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers, sorted in ascending order, qs is a list of non-negative integers, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing one string, stdin is empty, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to k and q. Then it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to p, and another list of integers and assigns it to qs. The function func_1 is called with p as an argument and its return value is assigned to remaining_players. A list comprehension is used to create a new list res, which contains the elements of remaining_players at the indices specified in qs. Finally, the string representation of res is appended to the results list.
