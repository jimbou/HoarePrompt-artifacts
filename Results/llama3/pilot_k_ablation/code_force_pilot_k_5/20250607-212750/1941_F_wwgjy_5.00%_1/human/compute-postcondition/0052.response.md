Output State: **n, m, k, a, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, s, i is increased by 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `remain` is calculated as `mid - b[i]`. The variable `j` is assigned the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order.
