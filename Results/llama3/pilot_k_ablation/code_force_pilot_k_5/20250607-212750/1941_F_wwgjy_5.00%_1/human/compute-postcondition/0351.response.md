Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines of integers. It calculates the minimum value of the maximum differences between two points (start and end) and a third point (s), considering a gap size (nd) if available. If no such value is found, it prints the initial gap size; otherwise, it prints the minimum value of the maximum differences.**
