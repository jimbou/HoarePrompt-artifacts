Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[2]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
