Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the first element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is the sum of the `jth` element of `f` and the `ith` element of `b`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
