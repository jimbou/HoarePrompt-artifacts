Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 4, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `remain` is `mid - b[4]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[4]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the sum of the element at index `j` in `f` and the element at index 4 in `b`, `i` is 4, `stdin` is unchanged. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
