Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k. The second line contains n space-separated integers. The third line contains m space-separated integers. The fourth line contains k space-separated integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            continue
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s` are integers. `m` is equal to 0. `i` is equal to `m`. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in the list `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, m, k, s are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is equal to m, remain is mid - b[m - 1], j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order. If res is equal to infinity, then the first element of the first tuple in gap which is start is being printed. Otherwise, res is not equal to inf, and res is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 0, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is equal to m, remain is mid - b[m - 1], j is the insertion point for mid - b[m - 1] in f to maintain sorted order, and stdin contains no input. If res is equal to infinity, the first element of the first tuple in gap which is start is being printed. Otherwise, res is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The program prints either the first element of the first tuple in the gap list if the minimum value of the maximum differences between end and start, start and s, and nd is infinity, or the minimum value of the maximum differences between end and start, start and s, and nd if it is not infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is greater than or equal to m, m is greater than or equal to 0, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is m, remain is mid - b[m-1], j is the insertion point of mid - b[m-1] in f to maintain sorted order. If res is equal to inf, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is gap[0][0] is being printed. Otherwise, if j is equal to k, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, n, m, k, a, b, gap, start, end, mid, nd, remain, stdin are unchanged. If j is greater than or equal to 1, s is the sum of the element at index j-1 in f and the element at index m-1 in b. If start is less than s and s is less than end, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res is unchanged. If j is less than 1, s is the sum of the element at index j in f and the element at index m-1 in b. Then res is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
