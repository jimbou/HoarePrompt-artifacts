The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 2, `k`, `s` are integers. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`. `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`. `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`. `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. `i` is 2.**
