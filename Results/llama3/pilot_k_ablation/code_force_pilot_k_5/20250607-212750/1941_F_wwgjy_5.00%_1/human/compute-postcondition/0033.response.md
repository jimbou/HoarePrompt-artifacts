Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `f[j] + b[i]`, `f[j] + b[i]` minus `start`, and `nd`, `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]`, `i` is 2, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the first element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd`. The value of `s` is still equal to `f[j] + b[i]`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
