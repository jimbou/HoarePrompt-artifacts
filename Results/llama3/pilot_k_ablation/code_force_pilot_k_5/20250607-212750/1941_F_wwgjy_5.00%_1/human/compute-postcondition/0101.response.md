Output State: **n, m are integers greater than 2, k, s are integers. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. i is 2. remain is mid - b[i]. j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order. We skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the "continue" statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
