Postcondition: ***n is greater than 3, m is greater than 4, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 4, remain is mid - b[4], j is the insertion point of mid - b[4] in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, n, m, k, a, b, gap, start, end, mid, nd, remain, stdin are unchanged. i is 4. If j is greater than or equal to 1, s is the sum of the element at index j-1 in f and the element at index 4 in b. If start is less than s and s is less than end, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res is unchanged. If j is less than 1, s is the sum of the element at index j in f and the element at index 4 in b.***
