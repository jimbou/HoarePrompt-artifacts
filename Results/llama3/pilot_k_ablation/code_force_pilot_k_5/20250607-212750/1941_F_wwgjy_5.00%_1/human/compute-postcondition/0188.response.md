Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[3]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
