The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 3, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, `s` is `f[j] + b[3]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**
