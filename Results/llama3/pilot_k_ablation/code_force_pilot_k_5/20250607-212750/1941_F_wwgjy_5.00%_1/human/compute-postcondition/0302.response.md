Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the first and second elements of the second tuple in `gap` if `gap` has more than one tuple, otherwise `nd` is 0, `res` is the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `_` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and if `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is less than 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity. The other variables remain unchanged.
