Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s` are updated according to their initial values and the given conditions. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` is infinity. `_` is increased by 1. `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two space-separated lists of integers. `i` is 1. `remain` is `mid - b[i]`. `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is less than 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.***
