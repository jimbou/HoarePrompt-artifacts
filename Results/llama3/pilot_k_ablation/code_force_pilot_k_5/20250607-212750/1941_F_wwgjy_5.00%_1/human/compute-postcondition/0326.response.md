Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 3, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. Otherwise, `res` retains its previous value, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[3]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `i`, `remain`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[3]`. The stdin still contains no input.
