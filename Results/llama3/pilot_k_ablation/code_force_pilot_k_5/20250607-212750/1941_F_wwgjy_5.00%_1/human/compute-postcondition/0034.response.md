Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are integers or lists of integers with their respective properties. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `f[j] + b[i]`, `f[j] + b[i]` minus `start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
