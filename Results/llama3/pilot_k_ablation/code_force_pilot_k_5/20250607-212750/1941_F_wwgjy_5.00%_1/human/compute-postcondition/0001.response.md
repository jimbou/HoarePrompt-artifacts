Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is infinity, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the first line of stdin. The list `a` contains integers read from the second line of stdin, and the list `b` contains integers read from the third line of stdin, sorted in ascending order. The list `f` contains integers read from the fourth line of stdin, also sorted in ascending order. The list `gap` contains tuples representing the differences and values of consecutive elements in `a`, sorted in descending order. The variables `start`, `end`, and `mid` are integers representing the start, end, and middle values of the first gap in `a`. The variable `nd` is an integer representing the difference of the second gap in `a` if it exists, or 0 if there is only one gap. The variable `res` is initialized to infinity. The variable `_` remains 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus the 4 inputs that were read.
