Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, and `s` remain the same. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `remain` is calculated as `mid - b[i]`. The value of `j` is determined as the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. Additionally, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration, moving on to the next iteration.
