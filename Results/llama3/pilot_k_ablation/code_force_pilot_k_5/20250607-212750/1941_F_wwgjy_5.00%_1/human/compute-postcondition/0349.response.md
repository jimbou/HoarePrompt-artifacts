Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to m, m is greater than or equal to 0, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is m, remain is mid - b[m-1], j is the insertion point of mid - b[m-1] in f to maintain sorted order. If res is equal to inf, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is gap[0][0] is being printed. Otherwise, if j is equal to k, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, n, m, k, a, b, gap, start, end, mid, nd, remain, stdin are unchanged. If j is greater than or equal to 1, s is the sum of the element at index j-1 in f and the element at index m-1 in b. If start is less than s and s is less than end, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res is unchanged. If j is less than 1, s is the sum of the element at index j in f and the element at index m-1 in b. Then res is printed.***
