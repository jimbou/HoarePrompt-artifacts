Postcondition: **n, m are integers greater than 2, k, s are integers. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. i is 2. remain is mid - b[i]. j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, k is updated to f[j] + b[i], and s is updated to f[j] + b[i]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then k is updated to f[j - 1] + b[i] and res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - (f[j - 1] + b[i]), (f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start, and nd.**
