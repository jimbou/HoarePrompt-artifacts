Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s` are integers. `m` is equal to 0. `i` is equal to `m`. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in the list `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd` is being printed.***
