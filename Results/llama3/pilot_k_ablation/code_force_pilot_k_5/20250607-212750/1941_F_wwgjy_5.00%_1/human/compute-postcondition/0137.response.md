Output: **The minimum of the previous value of res and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd (where end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, s is f[j] + b[m - 1] if start is less than s and s is less than end, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[m - 1], start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, and nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap)**
