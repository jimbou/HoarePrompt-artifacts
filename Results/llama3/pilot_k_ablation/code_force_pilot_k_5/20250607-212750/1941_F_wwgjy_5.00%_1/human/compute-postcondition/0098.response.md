Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `s` are integers. `m` is greater than 1. `i` is 1. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`. `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`. `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`. `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. If `j` is equal to `k`, then the current value of `j` is equal to `k` and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains equal to positive infinity. `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`. `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k`, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[0]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k`, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[0]`. The value of `start`, `s`, and `end` are updated based on the condition `start < s < end`.**
