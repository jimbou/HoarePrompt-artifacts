Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `m` is greater than 1. `i` is 1. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`. `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`. `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`. `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains equal to positive infinity. `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`. `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
