Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is equal to m, remain is mid - b[m - 1], j is the insertion point for mid - b[m - 1] in f to maintain sorted order, res is infinity, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[0]` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains infinity. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point for mid - b[i] in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, s is f[j] + b[i]. If j is greater than or equal to 1 and start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[i]` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid` - `b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid` - `b[i]` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 4, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 4, `remain` is `mid` - `b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid` - `b[i]` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `res`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
