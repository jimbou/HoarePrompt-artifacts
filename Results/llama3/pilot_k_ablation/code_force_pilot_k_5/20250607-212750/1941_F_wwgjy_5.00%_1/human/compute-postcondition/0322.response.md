Output State: **n is greater than 3, m is greater than 3, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 3, remain is mid - b[3], j is the insertion point of mid - b[3] in f to maintain sorted order and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
