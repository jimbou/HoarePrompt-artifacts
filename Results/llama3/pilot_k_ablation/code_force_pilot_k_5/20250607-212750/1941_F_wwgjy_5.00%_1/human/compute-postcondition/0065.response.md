Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `start`, `start` minus `start`, and `nd`, and its current value is infinity, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers, `i` is equal to `m`, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the last element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in the list `a` is being printed**
