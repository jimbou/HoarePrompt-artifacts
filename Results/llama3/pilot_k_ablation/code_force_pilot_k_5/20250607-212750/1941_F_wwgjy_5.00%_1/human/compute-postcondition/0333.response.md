Output State: **n is greater than 3, m is greater than 4, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 4, remain is mid - b[4], j is the insertion point of mid - b[4] in f to maintain sorted order and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, and `j` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
