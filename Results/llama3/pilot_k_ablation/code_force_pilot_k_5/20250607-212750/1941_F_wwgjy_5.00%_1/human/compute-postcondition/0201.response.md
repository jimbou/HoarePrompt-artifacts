Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 4, `remain` is `mid - b[4]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[4]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `res` is not equal to infinity, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[4]`. If `j` is equal to `k`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `s` is `f[j] + b[4]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[4])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[4]) - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[4]` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[4]`.***
