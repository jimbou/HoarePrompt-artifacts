Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the first and second elements of the second tuple in gap if gap has more than one tuple, otherwise nd is 0, res is infinity, and the loop variable _ is increased by 1, stdin contains 4 inputs: three space-separated lists of integers and one space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the first and second elements of the second tuple in `gap` if `gap` has more than one tuple, otherwise `nd` is 0, `res` is updated to be the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `_` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains 3 inputs: two space-separated lists of integers and one space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and if `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is less than 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s` are updated according to their initial values and the given conditions. If `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is less than 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` is infinity. `_` is increased by 1. `stdin` contains 1 input: one space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, `s` is `f[j] + b[2]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is greater than 3, m is greater than 3, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 3, remain is mid - b[3], j is the insertion point of mid - b[3] in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. Otherwise, res retains its previous value, s is f[j] + b[3] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[3], and stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is greater than 3, m is greater than 4, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 4, remain is mid - b[4], j is the insertion point of mid - b[4] in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, n, m, k, a, b, gap, start, end, mid, nd, remain, stdin are unchanged. i is 4. If j is greater than or equal to 1, s is the sum of the element at index j-1 in f and the element at index 4 in b. If start is less than s and s is less than end, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res is unchanged. If j is less than 1, s is the sum of the element at index j in f and the element at index 4 in b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
