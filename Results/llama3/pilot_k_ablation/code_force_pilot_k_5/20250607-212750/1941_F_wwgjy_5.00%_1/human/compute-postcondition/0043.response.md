Output State: **n, m, k, a, res, nd, start, end, mid, i is increased by 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is f[j] + b[i]**


In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, k, a, res, nd, start, end, mid, i, remain, and j remain the same as in the initial state. The value of s is updated to be the sum of the jth element of list f and the ith element of list b.
