Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is infinity, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers, i is 0, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the first element of b, j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is still 0, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `remain` is calculated as `mid` minus the first element of `b`, and the value of `j` is calculated as the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order.
