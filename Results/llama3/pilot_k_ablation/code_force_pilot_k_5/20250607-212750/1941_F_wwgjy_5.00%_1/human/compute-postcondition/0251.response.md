Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 3, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is 3, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point for mid - b[i] in f to maintain sorted order.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `remain` as the difference between `mid` and `b[i]`, and then finds the insertion point `j` for `remain` in the sorted list `f` using the `bisect.bisect_left` function. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `remain` is updated to `mid - b[i]`, and the value of `j` is set to the insertion point for `remain` in `f`.
