Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of all variables remain the same, and the loop continues with the next iteration.
