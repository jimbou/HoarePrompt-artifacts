Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s` are integers. `m` is equal to 0. `i` is equal to `m`. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd`. `res` is not equal to infinity. `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the last element of `b`. `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers.***
