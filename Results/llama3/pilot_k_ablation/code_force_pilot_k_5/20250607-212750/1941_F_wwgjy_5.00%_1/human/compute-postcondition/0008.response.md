Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the first element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is the sum of the `jth` element of `f` and the `ith` element of `b`. The current value of `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.**
