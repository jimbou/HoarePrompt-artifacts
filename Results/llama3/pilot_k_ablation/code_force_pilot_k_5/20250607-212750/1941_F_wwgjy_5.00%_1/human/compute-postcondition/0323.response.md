Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 3, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[3]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[3]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, and `j` remain unchanged. A new variable `s` is introduced, which is the sum of the element at index `j` in list `f` and the element at index 3 in list `b`.
