Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s` are updated according to their initial values and the given conditions. `s` is now `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. `i` is 1. `remain` is `mid - b[i]`. `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` is infinity. `_` is increased by 1. `stdin` contains 1 input: one space-separated list of integers.***
