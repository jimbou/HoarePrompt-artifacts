State: **n is greater than 3, m is greater than 4, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 4, remain is mid - b[4], j is the insertion point of mid - b[4] in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. Otherwise, res retains its previous value, s is f[j] + b[4] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[4], and stdin contains no input.**
