Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `m` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`. `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`. `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`. `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. `res` is equal to positive infinity. `remain` is equal to `mid - b[0]`. `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order and `j` is not equal to `k`. `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[0]`. The current value of `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than the current value of `end`. stdin is empty.***
