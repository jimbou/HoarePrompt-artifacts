Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `nd`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `i` is increased by 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start` < `s` < `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
