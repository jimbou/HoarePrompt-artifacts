Postcondition: ***n, m, k, a, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, s, i is increased by 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j == k, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, s is f[j] + b[i]. If start < s < end, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j >= 1, s is f[j - 1] + b[i].***
