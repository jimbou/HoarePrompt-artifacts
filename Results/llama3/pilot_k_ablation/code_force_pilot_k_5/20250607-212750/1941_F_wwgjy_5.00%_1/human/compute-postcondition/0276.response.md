Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is equal to m, remain is mid - b[m - 1], j is the insertion point for mid - b[m - 1] in f to maintain sorted order, res is not equal to infinity***
