Output State: **n, m is greater than 2, k, s are integers. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. i is 2. remain is mid - b[i]. j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order.**
