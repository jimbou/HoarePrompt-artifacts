Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is equal to m, remain is mid - b[m - 1], j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order, res is not equal to infinity, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[0]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `res` is not equal to infinity, stdin contains no input. If `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is not equal to infinity, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 0, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point for mid - b[0] in f to maintain sorted order, res is not equal to infinity, and stdin contains no input. If j is equal to k, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is f[j - 1] + b[i]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[2]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `res` is not equal to infinity. If `j` is equal to `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[3]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `res` is not equal to infinity. If `j` is equal to `k`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 4, `remain` is `mid - b[4]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[4]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `res` is not equal to infinity, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[4]`. If `j` is equal to `k`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `s` is `f[j] + b[4]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[4])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[4]) - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[4]` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
