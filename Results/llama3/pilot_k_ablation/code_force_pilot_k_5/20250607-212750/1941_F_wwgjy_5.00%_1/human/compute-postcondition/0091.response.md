Output State: **n, m, k are integers. m is greater than 1. i is 1. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. res is equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. Otherwise, res remains equal to positive infinity. remain is equal to mid - b[i]. j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order. s is equal to f[j] + b[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, remain, and j remain the same as before. The only change is in the value of s, which is now equal to f[j] + b[i].
