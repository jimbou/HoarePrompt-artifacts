Output State: **n is greater than 3, m is greater than 4, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, _, stdin, i is 4, remain is mid - b[4], j is the insertion point of mid - b[4] in f to maintain sorted order.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `mid - b[i]` to `remain`. Since `i` is 4, `remain` becomes `mid - b[4]`. The second line assigns the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to `j`, which is the index where `remain` should be inserted to maintain sorted order in `f`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `i` is still 4, and the value of `j` is updated to the insertion point of `mid - b[4]` in `f`. The value of `remain` is updated to `mid - b[4]`.
