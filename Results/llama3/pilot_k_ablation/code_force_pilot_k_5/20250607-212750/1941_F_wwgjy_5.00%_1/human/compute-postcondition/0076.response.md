Postcondition: ***n, m, k, s are integers. m is greater than 0. i is 0. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. res is equal to positive infinity. remain is equal to mid - b[0]. j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order and j is not equal to k. stdin is empty.***
