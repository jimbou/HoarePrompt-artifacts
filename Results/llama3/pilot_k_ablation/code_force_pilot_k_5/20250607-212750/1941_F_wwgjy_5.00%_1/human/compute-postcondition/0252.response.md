Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid` - `b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid` - `b[i]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one.
