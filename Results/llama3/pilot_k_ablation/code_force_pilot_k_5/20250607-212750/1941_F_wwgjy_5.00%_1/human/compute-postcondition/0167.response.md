Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point for `mid - b[0]` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
