Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k, i, remain, j, s are integers. m is equal to the second integer from the input. i is equal to m. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. res is equal to positive infinity. stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, m, k, s are integers. m is greater than 0. i is 0. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. res is equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. Otherwise, res remains equal to positive infinity. remain is equal to mid - b[0]. j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then the current value of j is equal to k. Otherwise, if j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is equal to f[j - 1] + b[0]. Otherwise, s is equal to f[j] + b[0]. The value of start, s, and end are updated based on the condition start < s < end. stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `s` are integers. `m` is greater than 1. `i` is 1. `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers. `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists. `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`. `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`. `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`. `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. If `j` is equal to `k`, then the current value of `j` is equal to `k` and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains equal to positive infinity. `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`. `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k`, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[0]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k`, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[0]`. The value of `start`, `s`, and `end` are updated based on the condition `start < s < end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, m are integers greater than 2, k, s are integers. a, b, f, gap are lists of integers. b, f, gap are sorted lists. start is the first element of the first tuple in gap. end is the second element of the first tuple in gap. mid is the average of start and end. nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap. i is 2. remain is mid - b[i]. j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, k is updated to f[j] + b[i], and s is updated to f[j] + b[i]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then k is updated to f[j - 1] + b[i] and res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - (f[j - 1] + b[i]), (f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start, and nd.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `s` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer greater than 3, m is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples of integers, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is 0 if gap has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is 4, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, s is f[j] + b[4], and if start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is updated to f[j - 1] + b[4].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
