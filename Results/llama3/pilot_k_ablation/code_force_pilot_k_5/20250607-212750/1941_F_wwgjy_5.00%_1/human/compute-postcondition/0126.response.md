Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is an integer, `s` is `f[j] + b[4]`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples of integers, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 4, `remain` is `mid - b[4]`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**
