Output State: **n, m, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, s, i is increased by 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables n, m, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, s, i, remain, and j are not affected by this statement. The variable i is still increased by 1, and the values of the other variables remain the same. The only change is that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.
