Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is infinity, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the first element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end minus s, s minus start, and nd, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: three lines of space-separated integers and one line of space-separated integers, i is 1, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the first element of b, j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if j is greater than or equal to 1 and start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end minus f[j] plus b[i], f[j] plus b[i] minus start, and nd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are integers or lists of integers with their respective properties. If `j` is equal to `k`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `f[j - 1] + b[i]` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `f[j - 1] + b[i]` minus `start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `f[j] + b[i]`, `f[j] + b[i]` minus `start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n, m, k, a, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res, s, i is increased by 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j == k, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, s is f[j] + b[i]. If start < s < end, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j >= 1, s is f[j - 1] + b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s`, `i` is increased by 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `j` is equal to `k`, we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
