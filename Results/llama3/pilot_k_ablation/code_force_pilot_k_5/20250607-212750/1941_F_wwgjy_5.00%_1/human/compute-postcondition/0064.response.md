The code prints the first element of the `gap` list, which is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference and values of consecutive elements in the list `a`. Since the `gap` list is sorted, the first element will be the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `a`.

Output: **the smallest difference between consecutive elements in list a**
