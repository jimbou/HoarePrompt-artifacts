The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s`, `i` is increased by 1, `remain`, `j` are integers or lists of integers with their respective properties**
