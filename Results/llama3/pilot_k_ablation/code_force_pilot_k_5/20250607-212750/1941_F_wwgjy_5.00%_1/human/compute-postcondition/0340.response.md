Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 4, `k`, `a`, `b`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `remain`, `stdin` are unchanged. `i` is 4. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is the sum of the element at index `j-1` in `f` and the element at index 4 in `b`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` is unchanged. If `j` is less than 1, `s` is the sum of the element at index `j` in `f` and the element at index 4 in `b`.***
