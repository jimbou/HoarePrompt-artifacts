Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `s`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are integers or lists of integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `f[j]` plus `b[i]`, `f[j]` plus `b[i]` minus `start`, and `nd`.***
