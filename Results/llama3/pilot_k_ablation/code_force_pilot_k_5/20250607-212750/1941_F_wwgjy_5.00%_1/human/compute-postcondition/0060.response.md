Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i` is increased by 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` remain unchanged.***
