Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `res`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `remain`, `i`, `j` are integers or lists of integers with their respective properties. If `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `f[j - 1] + b[i]` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` minus `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `f[j - 1] + b[i]` minus `start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.***
