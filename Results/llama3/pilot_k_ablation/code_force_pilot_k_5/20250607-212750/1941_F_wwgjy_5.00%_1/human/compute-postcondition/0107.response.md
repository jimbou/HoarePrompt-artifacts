Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 2, `k` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap` are lists of integers, `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted lists, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is 0 if `gap` has only one tuple, otherwise it is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `remain` should be inserted in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
