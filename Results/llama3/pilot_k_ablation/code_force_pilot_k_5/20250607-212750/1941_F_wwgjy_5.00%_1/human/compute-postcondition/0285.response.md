Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the first and second elements of the second tuple in `gap` if `gap` has more than one tuple, otherwise `nd` is 0, `res` is infinity, `_` is increased by 1, stdin contains 4 inputs: three space-separated lists of integers and one space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and the current value of `j` is equal to `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop continues to the next iteration, skipping the current iteration. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains the same inputs.
