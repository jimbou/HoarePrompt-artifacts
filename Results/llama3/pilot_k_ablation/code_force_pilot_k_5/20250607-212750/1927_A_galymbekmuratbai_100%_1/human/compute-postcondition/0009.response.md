To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the state of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `_` has increased, `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, `first_black` is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in `s`, `last_black` is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in `s`, `min_paint` is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `_` is 2**
