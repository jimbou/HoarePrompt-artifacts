Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 2**

The code reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from `stdin`, which reduces the number of test cases in `stdin` by 1. It then updates the values of `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` based on the new string `s`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
