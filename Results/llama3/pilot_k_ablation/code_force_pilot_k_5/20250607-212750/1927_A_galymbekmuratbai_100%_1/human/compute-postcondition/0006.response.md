Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 1**

The code reads an integer n and a string s from stdin, then finds the indices of the first and last 'B' characters in s. The minimum number of paint operations required to have all 'B' characters together in s is calculated as the difference between the last and first 'B' indices plus one. The values of n, s, first_black, last_black, and min_paint are updated accordingly. The value of t remains unchanged, and stdin now contains t-3 test cases. The value of _ remains 1.
