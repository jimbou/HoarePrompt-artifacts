Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer, last_black is an integer, min_paint is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 0**

The code executes in the following way: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The third line finds the index of the first 'B' character in `s` and assigns it to `first_black`. The fourth line finds the index of the last 'B' character in `s` and assigns it to `last_black`. The fifth line calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be painted to make all 'B' characters consecutive and assigns it to `min_paint`. 

After the code executes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 10, `s` becomes a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, `first_black` and `last_black` become integers representing the indices of the first and last 'B' characters in `s`, and `min_paint` becomes an integer representing the minimum number of characters that need to be painted to make all 'B' characters consecutive. Stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. The value of `_` remains 0.
