Output State: **t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 3, and the minimum number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, and the format of the test cases in `stdin` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` are updated based on the input provided in the first test case. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, as one test case has been processed.
