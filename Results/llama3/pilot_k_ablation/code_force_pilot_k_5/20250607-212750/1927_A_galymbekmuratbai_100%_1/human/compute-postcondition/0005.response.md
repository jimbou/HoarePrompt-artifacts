The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer, last_black is an integer, min_paint is an integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 1, and the minimum number of paint operations required to have all 'B' characters together in the string s which is min_paint is being printed**
