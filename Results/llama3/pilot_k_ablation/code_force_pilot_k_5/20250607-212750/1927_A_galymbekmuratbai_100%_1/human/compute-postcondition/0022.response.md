Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates the minimum number of 'B' characters in each string, which is the difference between the indices of the last and first 'B' characters plus one, and prints this value for each test case. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
