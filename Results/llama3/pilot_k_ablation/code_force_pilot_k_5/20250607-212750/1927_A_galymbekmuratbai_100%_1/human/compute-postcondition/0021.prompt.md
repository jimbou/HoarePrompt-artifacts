Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
    print(min_paint)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer, last_black is an integer, min_paint is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 0, and the minimum number of paint operations required to have all 'B' characters together in the string s which is min_paint is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 1, and the minimum number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 2, and the minimum number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 4 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 3, and the minimum number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed, the number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer between 5 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in s, stdin contains t-6 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, _ is 4, and the minimum number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed, the number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed, and the number of 'B' characters in s which is min_paint is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
