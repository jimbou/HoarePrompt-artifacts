The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `t` is an integer between 4 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 5 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, `first_black` is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' character in `s`, `last_black` is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' character in `s`, `min_paint` is an integer equal to the number of 'B' characters in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `_` is 4, and the minimum number of 'B' characters in `s` which is `min_paint` is being printed, the number of 'B' characters in `s` which is `min_paint` is being printed**
