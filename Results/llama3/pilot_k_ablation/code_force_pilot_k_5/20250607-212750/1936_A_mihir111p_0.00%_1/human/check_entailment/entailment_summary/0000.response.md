Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the values at these indices is maximized. The program uses a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of values and determine the maximum XOR.

The program first finds the index of the maximum value in the array using a series of queries. It then finds the index of the second maximum value by comparing the bitwise OR of the maximum value with other values. Finally, it finds the index of the value that produces the maximum XOR with the maximum value.

The program uses a function func_1 to perform the queries and compare the results. The function takes four indices as input, prints a query string, and returns the result of the comparison.

The execution summary shows that the function func_1 behaves as expected, printing a query string and returning the result of the comparison. The program uses this function to perform the necessary queries and determine the indices of the maximum XOR.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
