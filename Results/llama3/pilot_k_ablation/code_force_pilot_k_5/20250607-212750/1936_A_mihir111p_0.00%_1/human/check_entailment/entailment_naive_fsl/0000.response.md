Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The issue lies in the way it tries to find the maximum value of p_i ⊕ p_j. 

In the second part of the program, it tries to find the maximum value of p_i ⊕ p_j by comparing the values of p_i and p_j for each i in the list v. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible pairs of indices i and j. 

For example, consider the case where n = 4 and the permutation p is [0, 3, 1, 2]. The program will first find the maximum value of p_i, which is 3. Then, it will find the list v, which is [3]. However, it will not consider the pair of indices (3, 2), which has the maximum value of p_i ⊕ p_j.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should compare all possible pairs of indices i and j, not just the pairs where i and j are in the list v. 

Here is a correct solution:

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ans1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
        if x == '<':
            ans1 = i
    mx = 0
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
        if x == '<':
            v = []
            mx = i
            v.append(i)
        elif x == '=':
            v.append(i)
    ans = v[0]
    for i in v:
        for j in range(n):
            x = func_1(ans, ans1, i, j)
            if x == '>':
                ans = i
                ans1 = j
    print('!', ans, ans1)

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    return input()
```

This solution correctly finds the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized by comparing all possible pairs of indices i and j.
