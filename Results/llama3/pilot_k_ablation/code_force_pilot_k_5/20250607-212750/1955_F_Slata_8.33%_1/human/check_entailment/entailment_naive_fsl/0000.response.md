Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the sum of the counts of ones, twos, and threes is 2 modulo 3 correctly. In this case, the program should return the sum of the counts of ones, twos, and threes divided by 2, but the program returns the sum of the counts of ones, twos, and threes divided by 2 plus 1, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is 1 1 1 0, the program should return 1, but the program returns 2.

The correct program should be:

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 3 == 2:
            print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2)
        else:
            print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
