To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of the input integer `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` has been decreased by 2. This implies that `t` is now `t-2`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t-2`. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to increment it to 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and the contents of `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3 is equal to 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 2**
