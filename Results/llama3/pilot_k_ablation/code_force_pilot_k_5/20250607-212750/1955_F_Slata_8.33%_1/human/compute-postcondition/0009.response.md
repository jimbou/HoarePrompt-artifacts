Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3 is equal to 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 2.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been updated to the four integers read from the input. The sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3 is still equal to 3. The value of `i` remains 1. The stdin now contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and t is still an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) but has been decreased by 2.
