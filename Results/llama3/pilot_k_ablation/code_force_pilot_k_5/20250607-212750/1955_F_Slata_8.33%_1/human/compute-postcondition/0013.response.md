Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), `i` is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 2**

The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the four integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 200. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-6 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), since one line has been read.
