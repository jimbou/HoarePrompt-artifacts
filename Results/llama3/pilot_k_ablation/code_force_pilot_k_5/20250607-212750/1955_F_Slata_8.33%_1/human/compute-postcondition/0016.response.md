The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `input`. If `i` is less than `input`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `input` is an integer (1 <= `input` <= 10^4) and `input` is decreased by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 3 and `input` is decreased by 2.
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), `i` is 3, stdin contains t-8 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 4, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, d by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c divided by 2 is 3, otherwise 0**
