Output: ** `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3 is equal to 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 2, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3 which is equal to 3**
