Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), `i` is 3, stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 4, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, d by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c divided by 2 is 3, otherwise 0**

The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are updated to the four integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of four integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The values of the other variables are not affected.
