Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), stdin contains (t-1) lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are assigned the four integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains (t-1) lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The value of t is decreased by 1.
