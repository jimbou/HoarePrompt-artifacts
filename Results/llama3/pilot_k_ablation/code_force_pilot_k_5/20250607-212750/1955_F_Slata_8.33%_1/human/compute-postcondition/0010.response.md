The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3. 

Since the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3 is equal to 3, the code will print 3.

Output: **3**
