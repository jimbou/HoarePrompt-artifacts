The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t` (which is input). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), stdin contains t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 1, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3, which is equal to 3**
