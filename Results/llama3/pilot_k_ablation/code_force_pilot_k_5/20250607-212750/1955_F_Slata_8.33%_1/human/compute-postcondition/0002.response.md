The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2, and 3, respectively, being equal to 3.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` calculate the integer division of each variable by 2, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number.
2. The results of these divisions are summed up.
3. `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 3` calculate the remainders of each variable when divided by 2 and 3, respectively.
4. The sum of these remainders is compared to 3 using the `==` operator. If the sum is exactly 3, the expression evaluates to `True`, which is then converted to an integer value of 1 using the `int()` function. If the sum is not 3, the expression evaluates to `False`, which is converted to an integer value of 0.
5. The result of the integer division sum and the result of the remainder sum comparison are added together.

Output: **the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, and c divided by 2, and 3, respectively, is exactly 3, otherwise 0**
