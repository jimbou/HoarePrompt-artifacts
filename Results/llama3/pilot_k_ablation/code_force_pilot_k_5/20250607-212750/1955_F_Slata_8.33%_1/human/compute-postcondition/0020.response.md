Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), stdin contains 0 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by t, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3, which is equal to 3**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers between 0 and 200, the input contains no more lines with four integers, and the value of `t` has been decreased by the initial value of `t`. The loop has printed the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3, which is equal to 3.
