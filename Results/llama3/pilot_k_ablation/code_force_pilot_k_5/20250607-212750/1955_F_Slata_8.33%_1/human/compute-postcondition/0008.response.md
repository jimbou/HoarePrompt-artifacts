To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value of the input.

From the given state, we know that `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is decreased by 1. This implies that the input to the `range` function is `t`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `i` should be increased by 1, since it is the loop variable.
* `t` should be decreased by 1, since it is the input to the `range` function.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t is decreased by 2, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3, which is equal to 3, `i` is 1**
