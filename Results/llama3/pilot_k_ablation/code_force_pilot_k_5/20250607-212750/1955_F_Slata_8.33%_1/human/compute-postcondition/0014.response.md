The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`.

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` are the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, respectively. Since `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers between 0 and 200, these expressions will evaluate to integers between 0 and 100.
* `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 3` are the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 and 3, respectively. These expressions will evaluate to either 0 or 1.
* The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` is a boolean expression that checks whether the sum of the remainders is equal to 3. Since the remainders can only be 0 or 1, this expression will only be true if all three remainders are 1. In this case, the expression will evaluate to `True`, which is equivalent to the integer value 1. Otherwise, it will evaluate to `False`, which is equivalent to the integer value 0.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders is 3, and 0 otherwise.

Output: **sum of integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3, and 0 otherwise**
