#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a game where players and a ball ('.B') move around a grid based on commands read from standard input. The game starts by reading the grid dimensions, the grid itself, and the initial positions of players and the ball. Then, it reads a series of commands, each specifying a player or the ball, a movement direction (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and optionally a special action (Q, S, or none). The function updates the positions of players and the ball according to the commands, checks for collisions and goals, and prints messages when a player is eliminated, a goal is scored, or a player catches the golden snitch. Finally, it prints the final score of the game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a pair of integers representing a position on the field, and goal is a list of two lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents a goal position on the field, with the first list containing the red goals and the second list containing the blue goals.
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is an integer indicating the goal position of pos on the field, where 0 means pos is in the red goals, 1 means pos is in the blue goals, and -1 means pos is not in any goal.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the goal position of a given position on a field, returning 0 if the position is in the red goals, 1 if it's in the blue goals, and -1 if it's not in any goal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.' and the second character is either a digit from 0 to 9 or 'G' or 'Q'.
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value `res` which is `True` if the first character of `el` is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it is `False`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates a given 2-character string `el` and returns `True` if the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns `False`.
