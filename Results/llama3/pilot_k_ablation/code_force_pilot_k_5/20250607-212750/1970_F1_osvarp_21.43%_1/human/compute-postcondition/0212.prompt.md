Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 4, i is 4, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i-1, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-5 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, ind is m-1. If line[ind] is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If line[ind] is not '..', then elements[line[m-1]] is (3, m-1). If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[m-1]] is True if line[ind] is a player, otherwise it is False. If line[ind] is not a player and line[ind][1] is 'G', goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, m-1) if line[m-1][0] is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, m-1). If line[ind][1] is 'G', tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not, and goal[tmp] now contains an additional pair (i-1, ind).
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to `(2, m-1)`, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then if `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has been appended with `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to `(2, m-1)`, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `line` must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then if `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is now True. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has been appended with `(i, ind)`. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has been appended with `(i, ind)`. `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(4, 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to `(2, m-1)`, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `line` must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements[line[2]]` is `(4, 2)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[2]]` is False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, then if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing `(4, 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to `(2, m-1)`, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `line` must have at least 4 characters, `ind` is 3. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements[line[3]]` is `(4, 3)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[3]]` is False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, then if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing `(4, 3)`. If `line[ind]` is '..', then no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to `(2, m-1)`, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m+1` characters, `ind` is 4. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements[line[4]]` is `(4, 4)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[4]]` is False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, then if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` contains the pair `(4, 4)` appended to its previous value. If `line[ind]` is '..', then no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
