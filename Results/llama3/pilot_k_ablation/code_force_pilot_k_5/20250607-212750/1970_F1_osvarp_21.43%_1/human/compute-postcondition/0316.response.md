The code prints a string indicating that a player has been eliminated. The string includes the current time and the player that has been eliminated.

The time is given by the variable `time`, which is equal to 3.

The player is given by the variable `player`, which is equal to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise it is equal to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Since the value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `player`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the player that has been eliminated.

Output: **3 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is the player that has been eliminated, which is either obj or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
