Output State: **n is greater than 3, i is 3, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-4 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least 4 characters, ind is 4, tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not, and goal[tmp] now contains an additional pair (i, ind).**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of 0 to `tmp` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise it assigns 1 to `tmp`. The second line appends the pair `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. 

Since `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[4]]` is (3, 4). If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[4]]` is True. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, 4) if `line[4][0]` is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, 4). 

The value of `tmp` depends on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not. If `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1. The pair `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
