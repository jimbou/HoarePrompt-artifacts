Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (2, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, stdin contains `t-2` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is 0, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `tmp` is 1 if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', otherwise `tmp` is 0, `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', otherwise `goal` is a list of two empty lists.***
