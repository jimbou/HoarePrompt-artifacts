Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'. Additionally, `line[ind]` is not a player. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty, and the second list contains one element (0, ind). Otherwise, `goal` remains a list of two empty lists.***
