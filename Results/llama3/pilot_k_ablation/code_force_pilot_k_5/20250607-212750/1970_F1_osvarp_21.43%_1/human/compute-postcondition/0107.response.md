Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m+1 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False if `line[ind]` is a player. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. `elements` now also maps `line[ind]` to (i, ind).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the `elements` dictionary now also maps `line[ind]` to the pair `(i, ind)`. This means that the `elements` dictionary has been updated to include the new mapping, but all other variables remain unchanged.
