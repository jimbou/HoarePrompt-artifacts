Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for obj which maps to True if el is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 1, time is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[0], com is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to comand[2], el is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If el is '.S', then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team. If obj is '.B' and is a player or obj is a player and its new position is '.B', then the player is eliminated and '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' is printed where time is 1 and player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]. Otherwise, if com is 'T', then if goalIn(pos) is not -1, the index of the goal that pos belongs to is printed along with the time and the name of the goal. Otherwise, no output is produced. If com is not 'T' and obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to nxt. If obj is not '.B', then elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player and com is not 'T'.***
