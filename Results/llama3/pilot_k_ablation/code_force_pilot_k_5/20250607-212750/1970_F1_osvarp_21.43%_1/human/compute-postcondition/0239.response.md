Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string indicating that a goal has been scored, along with the current time and the name of the team that scored the goal.

The value of `time` is 0, as specified in the precondition.

The value of `team` is either 0 or 1, depending on the result of the `goalIn(pos)` function. Since `pos` is in the goal, `goalIn(pos)` returns a value other than -1, which is either 0 or 1. This value is assigned to `team`.

The value of `GoalName[team]` is a string representing the name of the team that scored the goal. Since `team` is either 0 or 1, `GoalName[team]` will be either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`, which are strings representing the names of the two teams.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format "0 [Team Name] GOAL", where [Team Name] is either the name of team 0 or team 1, depending on the value of `team`.

Output: **0 [Team Name] GOAL (where [Team Name] is either the name of team 0 or team 1)**
