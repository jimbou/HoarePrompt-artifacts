Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (1, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, ind is m-1. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[ind]] is False. If line[ind] is not a player, then allPlayers is an empty dictionary. If the second character of line[ind] is 'G', then goal is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (1, ind), and the second list contains one element (1, ind). If line[ind][1] is 'G' and line[ind][0] is not 'B', then tmp is 1. If line[ind][1] is 'G' and line[ind][0] is 'B', then tmp is 0. If line[ind] is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If line[ind] is not '..', then elements now also maps line[ind] to (1, m-1). If line[ind] is a player, then goal[tmp] now contains an additional element (i, ind). If line[ind][1] is not 'G', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If line[ind] is a player, then goal[tmp] now contains an additional element (i, ind).
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (1, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, ind is 0. If line[ind] is not '..', then allPlayers is a dictionary with line[ind] mapped to False if line[ind] is a player. Otherwise, allPlayers is an empty dictionary. If line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is 1 and goal is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, tmp is 0 and goal is a list of two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m characters, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False if `line[ind]` is a player. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 and `goal` is a list of two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m+1 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False if `line[ind]` is a player. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is '..', then `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `tmp` is 0, and `goal` is a list of two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m+2 characters, `ind` is 3. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False if `line[ind]` is a player, `tmp` is 1 if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and 0 otherwise, and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and two empty lists otherwise. If `line[ind]` is '..', then `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `tmp` is 0, and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. In all cases, `elements` now also maps `line[ind]` to (2, 3).

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to (2, 4), `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m+3 characters, `ind` is 4. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False, `tmp` is 1 if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and 0 otherwise, and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and two empty lists otherwise. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][1]` is not 'G' and 1 otherwise, and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and two empty lists otherwise. If `line[ind]` is '..', then `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `tmp` is 0, and `goal` is a list of two empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
