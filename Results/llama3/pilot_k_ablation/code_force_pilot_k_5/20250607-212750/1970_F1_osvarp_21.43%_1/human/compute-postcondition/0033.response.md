Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 3, `elements` is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs depending on the value of `line[ind]`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair if `line[ind]` is a player, otherwise it is empty, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', otherwise the second list is empty. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind), where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
