State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to True if `el` is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and `el` is a pair of characters. If `el` is '.S', then '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team. If the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, then `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to nxt and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False except obj which maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers, the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 1 if the current position pos is in the goal, otherwise the points remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B'] == nxt`), then player is the player occupying the new position `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', otherwise player is `obj` if `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is the position of '.B', and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' and the new position `nxt` is not occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is not the position of '.B'. If `com` is 'T', the team that scored the goal is printed, along with the goal name and the time. If `com` is not 'T', the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player.**
