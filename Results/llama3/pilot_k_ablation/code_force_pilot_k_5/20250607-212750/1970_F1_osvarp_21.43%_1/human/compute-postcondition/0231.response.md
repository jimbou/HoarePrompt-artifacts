Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' and the second list contains (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`, `player` is the player occupying the new position `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', otherwise `player` is `obj` if `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is the position of '.B'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `t`, `time`, stdin, `comand`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged. A new variable `player` is introduced, which is assigned the value of the player occupying the new position `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', or `obj` itself if `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is the position of '.B'.
