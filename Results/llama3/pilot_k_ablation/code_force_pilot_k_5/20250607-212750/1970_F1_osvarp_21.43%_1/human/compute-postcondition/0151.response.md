Output State: **n is greater than 3, i is 3, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-3 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least 2 characters, ind is 2, elements[line[2]] is (3, 2), goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, 2) if line[2][0] is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, 2).**

The code first checks the value of the first character of the pair of characters at index `ind` in the `line`. If it is 'B', it sets `tmp` to 0, otherwise it sets `tmp` to 1. Then, it appends the pair `(i, ind)` to the `tmp`-th list in the `goal` list. Since `i` is 3 and `ind` is 2, the pair `(3, 2)` is added to either the first or second list in `goal`, depending on the value of `line[2][0]`. No other variables are affected.
