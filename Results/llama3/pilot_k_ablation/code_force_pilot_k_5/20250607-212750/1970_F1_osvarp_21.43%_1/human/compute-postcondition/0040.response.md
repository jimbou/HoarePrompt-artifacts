Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` or `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 4, `elements[line[4]]` is assigned the value (0, 4). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind).***
