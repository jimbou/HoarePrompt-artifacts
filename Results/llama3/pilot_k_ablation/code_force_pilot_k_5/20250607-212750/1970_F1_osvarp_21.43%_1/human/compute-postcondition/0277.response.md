Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to True if `el` is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, stdin contains `t-6` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters equal to `comand[0]`, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) equal to `comand[2]`, `el` is a pair of characters, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`. If `obj` is '.B' and is a player or `obj` is a player and its new position is '.B', then the player is eliminated and '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' is printed where time is 1 and player is `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, the index of the goal that `pos` belongs to is printed along with the time and the name of the goal. Otherwise, no output is produced. If `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not '.B', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player and `com` is not 'T'.***
