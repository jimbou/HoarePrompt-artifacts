To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ind` and `line`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `ind` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `ind` becomes 1.

The state of `line` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `points`, `stdin`, `allPlayers`, `tmp`, and `goal`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (1, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m characters, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False if `line[ind]` is a player. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 and `goal` is a list of two empty lists.**
