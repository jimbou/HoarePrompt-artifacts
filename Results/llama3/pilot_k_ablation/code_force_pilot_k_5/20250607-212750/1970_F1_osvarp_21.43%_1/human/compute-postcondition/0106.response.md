To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `ind` and `line`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ind` is less than the length of `line`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is 1 and `line` has at least `m` characters.

To adjust the state, we need to increment `ind` by 1, so `ind` becomes 2. The length of `line` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it has at least `m+1` characters for the loop to execute again.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m+1 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False if `line[ind]` is a player. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 and `goal` is a list of two empty lists.**
