Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to (2, `m-1`), `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 2, `elements[line[2]]` is (3, 2)**

In this output state, the dictionary `elements` has been updated to map `line[2]` to the pair (3, 2), where 3 is the current value of `i` and 2 is the current value of `ind`. All other variables remain unchanged.
