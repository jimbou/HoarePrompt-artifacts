The code prints the current time and the name of the goal that the object is in, followed by the string 'GOAL'. The time is 3, and the goal name is determined by the index of the goal that the object is in, which is stored in the variable 'team'. The goal name is retrieved from the list 'GoalName' using the index 'team'.

Output: **3 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where GoalName[team] is the name of the goal that obj is in, which is either the first or second element of the GoalName list)**
