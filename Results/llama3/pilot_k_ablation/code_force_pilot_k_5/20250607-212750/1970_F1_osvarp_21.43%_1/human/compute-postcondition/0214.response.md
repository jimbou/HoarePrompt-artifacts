Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to an integer, which is the number of lines in the stdin minus one. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, as one line has been read to assign the value to `t`.
