Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for obj which maps to True if el is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 2, time is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[0], com is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to comand[2], el is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If obj is '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt), then player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 2 and player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]. Otherwise, if com is 'T', the value at index team in points is 11 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged. If obj is in the goal, the following is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal that obj is in. If com is not 'T', if obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to nxt.***
