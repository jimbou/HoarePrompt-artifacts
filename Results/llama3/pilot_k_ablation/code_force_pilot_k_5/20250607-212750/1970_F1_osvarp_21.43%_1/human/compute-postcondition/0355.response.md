Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index `team` is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S' or `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 4, `time` is 4, `stdin` contains `t-12` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is equal to `comand[0]`, `com` is equal to `comand[2]`, `el` is equal to `comand[1]`, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`. If `el` is '.Q', all players are set to True. If `el` is '.S', then `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' otherwise 0, and `points[team]` is 10 greater than its original value, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where `time` is 4 and `GoalName[team]` is the name of the goal for the team (0 or 1), otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. If `obj` equals '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, no update is made to `elements[obj]`. If `obj` is a player and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True, then `player` is assigned the value of `obj` and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where `time` is 4 and `player` is the player that is eliminated. If `obj` is not a player and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True, then `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where `time` is 4 and `player` is the player that is eliminated. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points[team]` is increased by 1, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where `time` is 4 and `GoalName[team]` is the name of the goal that `pos` belongs to. If `com` is not 'T', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player. If `obj` is not '.B', no update is made to `elements[obj]`.***
