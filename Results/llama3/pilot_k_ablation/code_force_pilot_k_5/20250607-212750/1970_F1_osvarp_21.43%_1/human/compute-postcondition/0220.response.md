Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to True, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, stdin contains t-3 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and `el` is a pair of characters with a value of '.Q'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The `allPlayers` dictionary now has `obj` mapped to True, and all other players are still mapped to False. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
