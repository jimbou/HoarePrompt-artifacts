The code prints a string indicating that a player has been eliminated. The string includes the current time and the name of the eliminated player.

The time is given by the variable `time`, which is equal to 2.

The eliminated player is given by the variable `player`. If `obj` is a player, then `player` is equal to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is equal to the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Since the exact value of `obj` and the contents of `grid` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `player`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current time and the name of the eliminated player.

Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is the value of player, which is either obj or the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
