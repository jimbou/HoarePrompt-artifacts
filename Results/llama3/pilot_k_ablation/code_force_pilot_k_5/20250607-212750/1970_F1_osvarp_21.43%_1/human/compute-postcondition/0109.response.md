Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m+1 characters, ind is 2, allPlayers is a dictionary with line[ind] mapped to False if line[ind] is a player, tmp is either 0 or 1, and goal is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if line[ind][1] is 'G', otherwise the second list is empty.**

The code modifies the values of `tmp` and `goal`. The first line assigns 0 to `tmp` if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it assigns 1 to `tmp`. The second line appends the pair `(i, ind)` to the `tmp`-th list in `goal`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
