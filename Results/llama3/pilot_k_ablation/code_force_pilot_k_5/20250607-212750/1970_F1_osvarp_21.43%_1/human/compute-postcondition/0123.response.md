Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, 4), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m+3 characters, ind is 4, tmp is 0 if line[ind][0] is 'B' and 1 otherwise, goal is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if line[ind][1] is 'G' and two empty lists otherwise, allPlayers is a dictionary with line[ind] mapped to False if line[ind] is a player and an empty dictionary otherwise.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated based on the value of `line[ind][0]`. If `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to 1. The `goal` list has also been updated by appending the pair `(i, ind)` to the list at index `tmp`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
