Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the final score of the game, which consists of the points earned by each team.

The `points` list contains two integers, where the value at index `team` is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S' or `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged. The `team` is determined by the value of `obj[0]`, which is either 'B' or not 'B'.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the final score. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the final score in the format "FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]".

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores of the two teams)**
