Postcondition: ***n is greater than 4, i is 4, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-6 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, line must have at least 4 characters, ind is 3. If line[ind] is not '..', then elements[line[3]] is (4, 3). If isPlayer(line[ind]) is True, then allPlayers[line[3]] is False. If isPlayer(line[ind]) is False, then if line[ind][1] is 'G', tmp is 1 and goal[tmp] is a list containing (4, 3) and (4, 3).***
