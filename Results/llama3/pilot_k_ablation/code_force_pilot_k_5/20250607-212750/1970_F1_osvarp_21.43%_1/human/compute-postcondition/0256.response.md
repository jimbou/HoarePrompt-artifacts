Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `obj` maps to True and each other player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters and is equal to `comand[0]`, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to `comand[2]`, `el` is a pair of characters and is equal to `comand[1]`, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `allPlayers[obj]` is changed to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `allPlayers` dictionary now has `obj` mapped to True, and all other players mapped to False. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
