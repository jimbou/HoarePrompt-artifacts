Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 0, i is 0, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one key-value pair: '.B' maps to (0, 0), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two empty lists, points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains a line with an integer t, and then t lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and optionally `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty, and the second list contains one element (0, ind). Otherwise, `goal` remains a list of two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and optionally `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind). Otherwise, `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not '..' then `elements` is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind), otherwise `elements` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: '.B' maps to (0, 0).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is '..', then `elements` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: '.B' maps to (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind), if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False, otherwise `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind).

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` or `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 3. If `line[ind]` is '..', then `elements` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: '.B' maps to (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs depending on the value of `line[ind]`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False if `line[ind]` is a player, otherwise `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, and `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', otherwise the second list is empty. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind), where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` or `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 4. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..' then `elements[line[4]]` is assigned the value (0, 4). If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, then if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
