Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` or `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is 4, `elements[line[4]]` is assigned the value (0, 4).**

In this output state, the value of `elements[line[4]]` has been updated to `(0, 4)`, where `0` is the value of `i` and `4` is the value of `ind`. The other variables remain unchanged.
