Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for obj which maps to True if el is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 2, time is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is equal to comand[0], com is equal to comand[2], el is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com, team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' otherwise 0, points[team] is 10 greater than its original value.**

In this output state, the code has modified the value of points[team] by adding 10 to it, depending on the value of obj[0]. The value of team is determined by the first character of obj, which is either 'B' or not 'B'. If obj[0] is 'B', team is 1, otherwise it is 0. The points list now has a value at index team that is 10 greater than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
