Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is an empty list, elements is a dictionary with one key-value pair: '.B' maps to (0, 0), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two empty lists, points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains n lines with m space-separated pairs of characters each, then a line with an integer t, and finally t lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` or `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty, `ind` is equal to `m`. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (1, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (1, ind), and the second list contains one element (1, ind). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `line[ind][0]` is not 'B', then `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `line[ind][0]` is 'B', then `tmp` is 0. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` now also maps `line[ind]` to (1, `m-1`). If `line[ind]` is a player, then `goal[tmp]` now contains an additional element (i, ind). If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `goal[tmp]` now contains an additional element (i, ind).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, ind is m-1. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers is a dictionary with line[ind] mapped to False, tmp is 1 if line[ind][1] is 'G' and 0 otherwise, and goal is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if line[ind][1] is 'G' and two empty lists otherwise. If line[ind] is not a player, then allPlayers is an empty dictionary, tmp is 0 if line[ind][1] is not 'G' and 1 otherwise, and goal is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if line[ind][1] is 'G' and two empty lists otherwise. If line[ind] is '..', then allPlayers is an empty dictionary, tmp is 0, and goal is a list of two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to (2, `m-1`), `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements[line[m-1]]` is (3, `m-1`). If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[m-1]]` is True if `line[ind]` is a player, otherwise it is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, `m-1`) if `line[m-1][0]` is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, `m-1`). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` now contains an additional pair (`i`, `ind`).

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is greater than 4, i is 4, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-5 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, ind is m-1. If line[ind] is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If line[ind] is not '..', then if line[ind] is a player, allPlayers[line[ind]] is False. If line[ind] is not a player and the character at index ind in line is 'G', then goal[tmp] has been appended with (i, ind).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
