Output State: **n is greater than 3, i is 3, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-3 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least 2 characters, ind is 1, tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not, and goal[tmp] has been appended with the pair (i, ind).**

In this final state, all variables retain their initial values except for `tmp` and `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` is determined by the first character of `line[ind]`, being 0 if it's 'B' and 1 otherwise. The `goal[tmp]` list has been updated by appending the pair `(i, ind)`, which represents the current position in the grid. The rest of the variables, including `n`, `i`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `points`, `stdin`, `line`, and `ind`, remain unchanged.
