Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to True if `el` is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, stdin contains t-5 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `el` is a pair of characters, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `t`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `comand`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged. The only change is that `comand` is now assigned the value of the next line from stdin, which contains a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces. The length of `comand` is not equal to 3. The stdin now contains t-5 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.
