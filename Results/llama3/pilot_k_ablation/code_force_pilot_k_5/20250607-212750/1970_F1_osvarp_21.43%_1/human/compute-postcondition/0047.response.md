Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (0, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0, if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind). The current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'.***
