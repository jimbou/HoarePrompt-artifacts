Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to True if `el` is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, stdin contains t-3 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and `el` is a pair of characters. If `el` is '.S', then '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed where time is 0 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team. If the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, then `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to nxt and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False except obj which maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers, the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 1 if the current position pos is in the goal, otherwise the points remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, stdin contains t-3 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B'] == nxt`), then player is the player occupying the new position `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', otherwise player is `obj` if `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is the position of '.B', and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' and the new position `nxt` is not occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is not the position of '.B'. If `com` is 'T', the team that scored the goal is printed, along with the goal name and the time. If `com` is not 'T', the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for obj which maps to True if el is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 1, time is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[0], com is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to comand[2], el is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If el is '.S', then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team. If obj is '.B' and is a player or obj is a player and its new position is '.B', then the player is eliminated and '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' is printed where time is 1 and player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]. Otherwise, if com is 'T', then if goalIn(pos) is not -1, the index of the goal that pos belongs to is printed along with the time and the name of the goal. Otherwise, no output is produced. If com is not 'T' and obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to nxt. If obj is not '.B', then elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player and com is not 'T'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for obj which maps to True if el is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 2, time is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[0], com is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to comand[2], el is a pair of characters and is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If the length of comand is 3, if el is '.Q', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If el is '.S', then team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' otherwise 0, points[team] is 10 greater than its original value, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team with index team in the GoalName list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the length of comand is not 3, if obj is '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt), then player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 2 and player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]. Otherwise, if com is 'T', the value at index team in points is 11 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged. If obj is in the goal, the following is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal that obj is in. If com is not 'T', if obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to nxt. If obj is not '.B', then no changes are made to the state of the program.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 3, time is 3, stdin contains t-10 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is equal to comand[0], com is equal to comand[2], el is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If the length of comand is 3, then if el is '.Q', all players are set to True. If el is '.S', then team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' otherwise 0, and points[team] is 10 greater than its original value, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 3 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team (0 or 1), otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. If the length of comand is not 3, then if obj equals '.B', elements[obj] is updated to nxt. Otherwise, no update is made to elements[obj].

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 4, time is 4, stdin contains t-11 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is equal to comand[0], com is equal to comand[2], el is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If el is '.Q', all players are set to True. If el is '.S', then team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' otherwise 0, and points[team] is 10 greater than its original value, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 4 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team (0 or 1), otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. If obj equals '.B', elements[obj] is updated to nxt. Otherwise, no update is made to elements[obj]. If len(comand) is not 3, stdin contains t-12 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces. If obj is a player and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) is True, then player is assigned the value of obj and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 4 and player is the player that is eliminated. If obj is not a player and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) is True, then player is assigned the value of grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 4 and player is the player that is eliminated. If goalIn(pos) is not -1, points[team] is increased by 1, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 4 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal that pos belongs to. If com is not 'T', elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player. If obj is not '.B', no update is made to elements[obj].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
