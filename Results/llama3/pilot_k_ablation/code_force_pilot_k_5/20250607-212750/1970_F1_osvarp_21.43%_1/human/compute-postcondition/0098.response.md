Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (1, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least m characters, ind is 0. If line[ind] is not '..', then allPlayers is a dictionary with line[ind] mapped to False if line[ind] is a player. Otherwise, allPlayers is an empty dictionary. If line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is 1 and goal is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind). Otherwise, tmp is 0 and goal is a list of two empty lists.***
