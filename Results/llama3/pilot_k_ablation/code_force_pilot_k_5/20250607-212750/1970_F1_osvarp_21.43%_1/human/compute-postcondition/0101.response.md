Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains t-2 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least m characters, `ind` is 1, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `line[ind]` mapped to False, `tmp` is 1 if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' otherwise `tmp` is 0, and `goal` is a list of two lists where the second list contains the pair (i, ind) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G' otherwise `goal` is a list of two empty lists.**

The code updates the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to False. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `tmp` and `goal` is still dependent on the value of `line[ind][1]`.
