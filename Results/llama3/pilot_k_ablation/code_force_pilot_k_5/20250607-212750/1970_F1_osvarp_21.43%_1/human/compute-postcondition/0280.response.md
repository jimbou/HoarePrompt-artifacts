Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to True if `el` is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' and the second list contains (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index `team` is 10 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S' or `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-7` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters and is equal to `comand[0]`, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to `comand[2]`, `el` is a pair of characters and is equal to `comand[1]`, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`.**

The code reads a line from `stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, assigning it to the variable `comand`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains `t-7` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.
