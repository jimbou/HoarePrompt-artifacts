Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' and the second list contains `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' and the new position `nxt` is not occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player and the new position `nxt` is not the position of '.B'. The command `com` is not equal to 'T'. If `obj` is a player, the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**
