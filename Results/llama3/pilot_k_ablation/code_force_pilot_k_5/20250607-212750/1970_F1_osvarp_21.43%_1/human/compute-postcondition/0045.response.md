Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (0, ind) if line[ind] is not '..'. points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-1 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty, ind is equal to m. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers is a dictionary with one key-value pair: line[ind] maps to False. Otherwise, allPlayers is an empty dictionary. If the second character of line[ind] is 'G', then goal is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (0, ind), and the second list contains one element (0, ind).**

The code reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of pairs of characters, and appends this list to the grid. This increases the number of lists in the grid by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
