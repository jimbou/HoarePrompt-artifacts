Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (1, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-1 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least 3 characters, ind is 2. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[ind]] is False. If line[ind] is not a player, then allPlayers is an empty dictionary. If the second character of line[ind] is 'G', then goal is a list of two lists, the first list is empty if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise the first list contains one element (1, ind), and the second list contains one element (1, ind). If line[ind][1] is 'G' and line[ind][0] is not 'B', then tmp is 1. If line[ind][1] is 'G' and line[ind][0] is 'B', then tmp is 0. If line[ind] is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. elements now also maps line[ind] to (1, 2). goal[tmp] now contains an additional element (i, ind).**
