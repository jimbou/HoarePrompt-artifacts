Output State: **n is greater than 3, i is 3, m is an integer, grid is a list of n+1 lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', and line[ind] maps to (2, m-1), points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t-4 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty and must have at least 3 characters, ind is 3. If line[ind] is not '..', then elements[line[3]] is (3, 3). If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[3]] is False. If line[ind] is not a player and line[ind][1] is 'G', goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, 3) if line[3][0] is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, 3). elements[line[ind]] is now (3, 3). tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not. goal[tmp] now contains an additional pair (i, ind).**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns a value to `tmp` based on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not. If it is 'B', `tmp` becomes 0; otherwise, it becomes 1. The second line appends the pair `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. 

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. `n` is still greater than 3, `i` is still 3, `m` is still an integer, `grid` is still a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is still a dictionary with the same key-value pairs, `points` is still a list of two zeros, `stdin` still contains `t-4` lines with a pair of characters and a command, `line` is still not empty and must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is still 3. The conditions for `elements[line[3]]`, `allPlayers[line[3]]`, and `goal` are still valid.
