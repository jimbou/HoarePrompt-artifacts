Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for `obj` which maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index `team` is 11 greater than its original value if `el` is '.S' or `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 3, `time` is 3, stdin contains `t-10` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters and is equal to `comand[0]`, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and is equal to `comand[2]`, `el` is a pair of characters and is equal to `comand[1]`, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of `obj` in `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after applying the movement command `com`, and if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the index of the goal that `obj` is in, which is 0 if `obj` is in the first list of `goal` and 1 if `obj` is in the second list of `goal`, and the following is printed: '3 [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where GoalName[team] is the name of the goal that obj is in, which is either 'A' or 'B'.***
