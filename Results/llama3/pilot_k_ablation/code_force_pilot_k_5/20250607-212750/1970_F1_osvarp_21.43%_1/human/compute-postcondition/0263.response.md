Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, except for obj which maps to True if el is '.Q', otherwise each player maps to False, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', `points` is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S', otherwise the values remain unchanged, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, stdin contains `t-6` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters equal to comand[0], `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) equal to comand[2], `el` is a pair of characters, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, `pos` is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com, and `player` is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]].**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `t`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `comand`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged. The only change is that `player` is now assigned the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is assigned the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
