Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t or t-1 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, line is not empty, ind is 4, elements[line[4]] is assigned the value (0, 4), tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of line[ind][0], and goal[tmp] has an additional element (i, ind).**

The code snippet modifies the `goal` list by appending a new element based on the value of `tmp`, which is determined by the first character of `line[ind]`. If the first character is 'B', `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to 1. The new element appended to `goal[tmp]` is a tuple containing the current values of `i` and `ind`, which are 0 and 4, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
