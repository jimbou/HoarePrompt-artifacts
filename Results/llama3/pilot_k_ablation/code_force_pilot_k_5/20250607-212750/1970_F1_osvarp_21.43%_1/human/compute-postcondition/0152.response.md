Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to (2, `m-1`), `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 2, `elements[line[2]]` is (3, 2). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, 2) if `line[2][0]` is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, 2).***
