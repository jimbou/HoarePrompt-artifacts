Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 4, time is 4, stdin contains t-11 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is equal to comand[0], com is equal to comand[2], el is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If el is '.Q', all players are set to True. If el is '.S', then team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' otherwise 0, and points[team] is 10 greater than its original value, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 4 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team (0 or 1), otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. If obj equals '.B', elements[obj] is updated to nxt. Otherwise, no update is made to elements[obj].**

The code snippet modifies the `points` list by adding 10 to the value at index `team`, which is determined by the value of `obj[0]`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.
