Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: each player maps to False, goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two zeros, stdin contains t lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the grid is fully populated with pairs of characters, the elements dictionary maps each pair of characters to its corresponding position in the grid, the allPlayers dictionary maps each player to False, the goal list contains the positions of the goals for each player, and the points list remains unchanged. The stdin contains the remaining commands to be executed.
