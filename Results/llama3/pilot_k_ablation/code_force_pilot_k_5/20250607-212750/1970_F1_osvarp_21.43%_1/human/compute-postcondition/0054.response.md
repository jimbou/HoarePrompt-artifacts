Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (1, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains one element (0, ind) if `line[ind][0]` is not 'B', otherwise the first list is empty, and the second list contains one element (0, ind). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
