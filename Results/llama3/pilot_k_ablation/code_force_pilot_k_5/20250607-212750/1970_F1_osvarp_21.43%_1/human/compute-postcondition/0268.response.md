The code prints a string indicating that a goal has been scored. The string includes the current time, which is 1, and the name of the goal, which is determined by the index of the goal that the object's position belongs to.

Since the value of `team` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the object's position is in the first or second list of the `goal` list, the `GoalName[team]` expression will evaluate to either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`. However, the exact values of `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are not provided in the precondition.

Therefore, the output will be a string in the format "1 [GoalName] GOAL", where [GoalName] is either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`, depending on the value of `team`.

Output: **1 [GoalName] GOAL (where [GoalName] is either GoalName[0] or GoalName[1], depending on the value of team)**
