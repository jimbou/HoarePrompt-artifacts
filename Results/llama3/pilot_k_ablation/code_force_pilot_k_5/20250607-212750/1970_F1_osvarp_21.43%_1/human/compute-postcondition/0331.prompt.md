You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each line[ind] maps to (i, ind) if line[ind] is not '..', goal is a list of two lists, the first list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and the second list contains (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', points is a list of two integers where the value at index team is 10 greater than its original value if el is '.S' or obj[0] is 'B', otherwise the values remain unchanged, t must be greater than 3, time is 3, stdin contains t-10 lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is equal to comand[0], com is equal to comand[2], el is equal to comand[1], comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and the length of comand is not equal to 3, pos is a tuple containing the position of obj in elements, and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after applying the movement command com. If the length of comand is 3, then if el is '.Q', all players are set to True. If el is '.S', then team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' otherwise 0, and points[team] is 10 greater than its original value, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 3 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team (0 or 1), otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. If the length of comand is not 3, then if obj equals '.B', elements[obj] is updated to nxt. Otherwise, no update is made to elements[obj].
```
for time in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
