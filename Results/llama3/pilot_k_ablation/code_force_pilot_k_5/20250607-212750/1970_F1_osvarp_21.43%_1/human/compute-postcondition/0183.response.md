Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to `(0, 0)` and each `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to `(2, m-1)`, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least `m` characters, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then if `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has been appended with `(i, ind)`.***
