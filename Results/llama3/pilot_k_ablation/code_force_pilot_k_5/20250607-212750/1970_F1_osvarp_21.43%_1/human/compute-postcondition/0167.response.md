Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n+1` lists, each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (0, 0) and each `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind]` is not '..', and `line[ind]` maps to (2, `m-1`), `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines with a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `line` is not empty and must have at least 4 characters, `ind` is 4. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the program remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements[line[4]]` is (3, 4). If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[4]]` is True. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal` is a list of two lists, the first list contains (3, 4) if `line[4][0]` is not 'B', otherwise the second list contains (3, 4). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` now contains an additional pair (`i`, `ind`).***
