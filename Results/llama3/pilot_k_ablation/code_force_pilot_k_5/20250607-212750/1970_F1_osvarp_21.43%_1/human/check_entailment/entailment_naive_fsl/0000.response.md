Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal correctly. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, in the program, the points are incremented for the team that scored the goal, regardless of whether it was the correct goal or not.

For example, if a red player scores in the red goal, the program will increment the red team's points, but according to the problem description, the blue team should win a point in this case.

To fix this, the program should check whether the goal is the correct one for the team that scored, and increment the points accordingly.
