Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The function `func_1` checks if the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`k`) is greater than or equal to `n-1`, which is the minimum number of bridges needed to disconnect all islands from island 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, it means that Dominater cannot disconnect all islands from island 1, and Everule can visit all islands. The program correctly returns 1 in the first case and `n` in the second case.

I have checked the program with various inputs and it seems to work correctly for all cases. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
