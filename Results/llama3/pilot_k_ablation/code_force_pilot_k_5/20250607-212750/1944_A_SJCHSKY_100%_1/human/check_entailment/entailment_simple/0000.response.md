Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by considering the number of bridges that Dominater can destroy. If Dominater can destroy at least n-1 bridges, then Everule can only visit island 1. This is because Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it from the rest of the islands.

On the other hand, if Dominater can destroy fewer than n-1 bridges, then Everule can visit all islands. This is because there will always be at least one path from island 1 to every other island, as long as there are fewer than n-1 bridges destroyed.

The given program correctly implements this logic. The function func_1 checks if k is greater than or equal to n-1. If it is, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, the function returns n, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

Correctness: **True**
