Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program uses a function `func_1` to calculate this minimum number.

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy.

The function first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. In this case, Everule can still visit all islands, because there will always be at least one path from island 1 to every other island. Therefore, the function returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls the `func_1` function with these values. The result of the function is then printed.

Based on the problem description and the provided program, the program correctly implements the required logic. It correctly handles the cases where Dominater can or cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and it returns the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit in each case.

Correctness: **True**
