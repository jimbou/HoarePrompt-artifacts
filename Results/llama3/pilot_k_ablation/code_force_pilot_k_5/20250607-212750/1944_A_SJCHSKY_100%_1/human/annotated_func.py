#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.
    if (k >= n - 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    else :
        return n
        #The program returns a positive integer n.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph with n nodes and k edges, and returns either 1 if k is greater than or equal to n-1, or n otherwise.
