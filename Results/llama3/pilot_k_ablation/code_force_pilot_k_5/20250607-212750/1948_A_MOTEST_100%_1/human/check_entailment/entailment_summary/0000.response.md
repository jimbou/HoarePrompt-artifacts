Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then `t` number of integers from standard input.
2. For each integer `n`, the program checks if `n` is odd. If it is, the program prints 'NO', which is correct according to the problem description.
3. If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' and constructs a string `ans` consisting of the first `n // 2` uppercase English letters, each repeated twice. This is a valid solution according to the problem description, as each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. The program consumes all input from standard input and leaves it empty, which is consistent with the execution summary.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
