Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters. The program correctly handles the case when n is odd by printing 'NO', as it is impossible to build such a string.

When n is even, the program constructs a string by repeating each of the first n // 2 uppercase letters twice. This ensures that each character in the string has exactly one neighbor that is the same, thus making it a special character. The program correctly prints 'YES' and the constructed string in this case.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
