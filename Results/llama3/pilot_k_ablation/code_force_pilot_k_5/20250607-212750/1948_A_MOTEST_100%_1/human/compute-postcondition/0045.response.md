The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 3, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and the string `ans` (which is the first `n//2` characters of `s` repeated twice) is printed, and `x` is `n//2`, and `j` is `n//2 - 1`.**
