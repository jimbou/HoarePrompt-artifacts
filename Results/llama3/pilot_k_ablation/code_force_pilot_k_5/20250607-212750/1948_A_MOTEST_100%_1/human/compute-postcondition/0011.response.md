The code snippet modifies the variables `ans`, `x`. 

The first line appends to `ans` the character at index `x` in string `s` repeated twice. Since `x` is 1, it appends the second character of `s` repeated twice to `ans`. The second character of `s` is an uppercase English letter. `ans` now consists of the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice.

The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 2.

The variables `t`, `s`, `i`, `n`, and `j` are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer that is at least 1, s is a string of all uppercase English letters, i is 0, n is an even integer that is at least 4, ans consists of the first character of s repeated twice, followed by the second character of s repeated twice, x is 2, j is 1**
