The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n // 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, n is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1, so j is 3, and for the loop to execute again n must be at least 6.
State: **t is an integer that is at least 2, s is a string of all uppercase English letters, i is 1, n is an integer that is at least 6, ans is a string consisting of the first character of s repeated twice, the second character of s repeated twice, and the third character of s repeated twice, x is 3, j is 3**
