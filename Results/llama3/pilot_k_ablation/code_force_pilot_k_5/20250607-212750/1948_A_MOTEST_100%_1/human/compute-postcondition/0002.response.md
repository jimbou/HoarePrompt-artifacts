Output State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 1, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input from `stdin`, which initially contained a series of integers. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `stdin` has been read, it now contains no input.
