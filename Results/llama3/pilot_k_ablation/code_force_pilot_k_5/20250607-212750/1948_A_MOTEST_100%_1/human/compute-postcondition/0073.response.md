To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2):`. The objects involved are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer that is at least 2, and `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `i`, `ans`, and `x`) are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 4, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer that is at least 2, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
