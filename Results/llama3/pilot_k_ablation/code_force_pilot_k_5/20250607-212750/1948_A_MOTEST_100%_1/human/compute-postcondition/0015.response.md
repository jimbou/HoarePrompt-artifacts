The code snippet modifies the variables `ans`, `x`. The first line appends the character at index `x` in string `s` repeated twice to `ans`. Since `x` is 3, it appends the fourth character of `s` repeated twice to `ans`. The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 4.

Output State: **t is an integer that is at least 1, s is a string of all uppercase English letters, i is 0, n is an even integer that is at least 4, ans consists of the first character of s repeated twice, followed by the second character of s repeated twice, and then the third character of s repeated twice, and then the fourth character of s repeated twice, x is 4, j is 3**
