To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an even integer that is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. Since `n` is an even integer that is at least 4, `n // 2` will be at least 2. Therefore, `n` can remain the same.

The other variables, `t`, `s`, `i`, `ans`, and `x`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 1, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer that is at least 4, `ans` consists of the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 2**
