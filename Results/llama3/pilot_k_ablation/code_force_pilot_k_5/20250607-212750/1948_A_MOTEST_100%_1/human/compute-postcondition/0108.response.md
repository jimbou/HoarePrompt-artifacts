Output State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 1, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is `t`, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and a string `ans` is printed, which consists of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations specified by the value of `t`. The loop has finished executing, and the final state of the variables is as follows:

*   `t` is an integer that is at least 1, indicating the number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute.
*   `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, which remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
*   `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed for all specified iterations.
*   stdin contains no input, as all input values have been consumed by the loop.
*   If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed, indicating that the input value `n` does not meet the condition for printing 'YES' and the string `ans`.
*   If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and a string `ans` is printed, which consists of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice. This indicates that the loop has successfully processed the input value `n` and generated the desired output string `ans`.
