Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 1 input: a series of integers, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, s is a string of all uppercase English letters
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans, x = '', 0
        x = 0
        for j in range(n // 2):
            ans += s[x] * 2
            x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer that is at least 1, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 0. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and a string `ans` is printed, which consists of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and the string `ans` (which is the first `n//2` characters of `s` repeated twice) is printed, and `x` is `n//2`, and `j` is `n//2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer that is at least 3, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and `ans` is printed, which is a string consisting of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer that is at least 4, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer that was provided as input, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, `ans` is a string consisting of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer that is at least 5, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer that was provided as input, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, ans contains two copies of each character of `s` up to the (`n` // 2)th character, `x` is `n` // 2, `j` is `n` // 2 - 1, and ans is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
