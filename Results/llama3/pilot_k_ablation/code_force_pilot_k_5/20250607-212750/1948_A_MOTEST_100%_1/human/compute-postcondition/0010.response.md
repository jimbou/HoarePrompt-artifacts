To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an even integer that is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `n` is an even integer that is at least 2, we can conclude that `n` is at least 4.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 1, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer that is at least 4, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
