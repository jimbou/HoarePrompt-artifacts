Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and the string `ans` (which is the first `n//2` characters of `s` repeated twice) is printed, and `x` is `n//2`, and `j` is `n//2 - 1`.***
