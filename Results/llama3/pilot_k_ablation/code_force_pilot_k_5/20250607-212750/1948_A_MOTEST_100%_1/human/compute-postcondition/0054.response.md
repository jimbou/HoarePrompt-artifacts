According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
