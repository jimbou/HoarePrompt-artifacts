The code snippet modifies the values of `ans`, `x`. The first line appends the character at index `x` in string `s` repeated twice to `ans`. Since `x` is 2, it appends the third character of `s` repeated twice to `ans`. The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 3.

Output State: **t is an integer that is at least 2, s is a string of all uppercase English letters, i is 1, n is an integer that is at least 4, ans is a string consisting of the first character of s repeated twice, the second character of s repeated twice, and the third character of s repeated twice, x is 3, j is 2**
