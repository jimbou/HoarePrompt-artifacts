Output State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 4, `s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer that was provided as input, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer provided as input. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since stdin initially contained no input and an input was accepted, stdin now also contains no input.
