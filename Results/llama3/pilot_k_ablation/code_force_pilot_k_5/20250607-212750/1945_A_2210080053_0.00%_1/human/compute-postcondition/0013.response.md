The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `p`, `q`, and `r` from the file object, which has at least 2 lines. The second line increments `q` by the value of `r`. 

Since `q` is equal to its original value plus 3r, we can represent its original value as `q - 3r`. After the first line, `q` becomes `q - 3r + r`, which simplifies to `q - 2r`. The second line increments `q` by `r`, making it `q - 2r + r`, which simplifies to `q - r`. 

The values of `p` and `r` are not affected by the code snippet. The file object has at least 1 line left after the execution of the code.

Output State: **p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value minus r, r is an integer, the file object has at least 1 line.**
