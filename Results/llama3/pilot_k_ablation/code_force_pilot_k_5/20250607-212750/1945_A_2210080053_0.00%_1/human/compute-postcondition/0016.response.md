The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and file object, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object.  If the file object has at least 2 lines the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, the file object has at least 1 line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the file object must have at least 2 lines and the line is the second line in the file.
State: **`p` is an integer, `q` is an integer equal to its original value minus `r`, `r` is an integer, the file object has at least 2 lines, and this is printed: `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]`, line is the second line in the file**
