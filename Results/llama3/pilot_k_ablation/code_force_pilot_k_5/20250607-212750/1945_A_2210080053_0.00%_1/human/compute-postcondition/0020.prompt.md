Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three non-negative integers (a, b, c) separated by a space, where a is the number of introverts, b is the number of extroverts, and c is the number of universals.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
    p, q, r = map(int, line.split())
    q += r
    print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus r, stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 1 line, and this is printed: either the tuple (p - q // 3, -1) if r is greater than or equal to q % 3, or -1 if r is less than q % 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus 2r, stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 1 line, and this is printed: either the tuple (p - q // 3, -1) if r is greater than or equal to q % 3, or -1 if r is less than q % 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus 3r, stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 1 line, and this is printed: either the tuple (p - q // 3, -1) if r is greater than or equal to q % 3, or -1 if r is less than q % 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value minus r, r is an integer, the file object has at least 1 line, and this is printed: (p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value plus r, r is an integer, the file object has at least 1 line, and this is printed: (p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
