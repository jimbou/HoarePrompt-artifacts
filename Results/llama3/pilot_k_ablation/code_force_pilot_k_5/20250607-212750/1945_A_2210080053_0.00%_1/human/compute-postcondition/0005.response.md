Output State: **p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus 2r, stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 1 line, and this is printed: either the tuple (p - q // 3, -1) if r is greater than or equal to q % 3, or -1 if r is less than q % 3**

In this output state, the values of p, q, and r are integers. The value of q is equal to its original value plus 2r, which means that q has been incremented by 2r. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the file object has at least 1 line. The code has also printed either the tuple (p - q // 3, -1) if r is greater than or equal to q % 3, or -1 if r is less than q % 3.
