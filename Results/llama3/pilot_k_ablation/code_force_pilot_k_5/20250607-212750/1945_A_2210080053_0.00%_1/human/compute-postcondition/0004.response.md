The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and the file object, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object.  If the file object has at least 2 lines the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, the file object has at least 1 line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the file object must have at least 2 lines and the line is the second line in the file.
State: **p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus r, stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 2 lines, and this is printed: either the tuple (p - q // 3, -1) if r is greater than or equal to q % 3, or -1 if r is less than q % 3, line is the second line in the file**
