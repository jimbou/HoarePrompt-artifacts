The `print` statement will print a tuple containing two values. The first value is the result of the expression `p - q // 3`, and the second value is `-1`. However, the expression is enclosed in a conditional expression, which means that the value of `r < q % 3` will determine which value is printed.

If `r < q % 3` is `True`, then the first value `p - q // 3` will be printed. This value is the result of subtracting the integer division of `q` by 3 from `p`.

If `r < q % 3` is `False`, then the second value `-1` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the result of the expression `p - q // 3` or `-1`, depending on the value of the condition `r < q % 3`.

Output: **(p - q // 3) if r is less than q % 3, otherwise -1 (where p, q, and r are integers)**
