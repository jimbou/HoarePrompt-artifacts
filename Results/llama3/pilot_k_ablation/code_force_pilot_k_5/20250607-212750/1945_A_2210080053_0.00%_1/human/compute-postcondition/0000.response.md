To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, which are `line` and the file object represented by `open(0)`.

The loop will execute if there is at least one line in the file object after the first line (since we're using `[1:]` to skip the first line). 

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 2 lines, line is the second line**
