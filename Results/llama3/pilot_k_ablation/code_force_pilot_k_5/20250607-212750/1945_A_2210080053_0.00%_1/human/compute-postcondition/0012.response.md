To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head `for line in [*open(0)][1:]:`. The loop head involves the file object `open(0)` and the list comprehension `[*open(0)][1:]`.

Since the loop has already executed once, the file object `open(0)` has been read once, and the list comprehension has been evaluated. To execute the loop again, the file object must have at least one more line to read.

The state of the variables `p`, `q`, and `r` is not relevant to the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states. The state of the file object `open(0)` is the only one that needs to be adjusted.

State: **`p`, `q`, and `r` are integers, `q` is equal to its original value plus 3r, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, and the file object has at least 2 lines**
