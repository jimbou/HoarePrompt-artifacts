Output State: **p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus r, stdin contains multiple test cases, the file object has at least 1 line.**

In this output state, the values of p, q, and r are integers because they were assigned integer values from the second line of the file object using the map function. The value of q is equal to its original value plus r because the second line of code adds r to q. Stdin still contains multiple test cases because the code does not modify or access stdin. The file object has at least 1 line because the code only reads the second line, leaving at least one line remaining.
