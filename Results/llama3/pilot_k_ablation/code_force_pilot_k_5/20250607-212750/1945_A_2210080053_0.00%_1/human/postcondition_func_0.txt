This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It then calculates the total number of extroverts and universals, and prints the difference between the number of introverts and the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, unless the number of universals is less than the remainder of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, in which case it prints -1.
