Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. It first adds the number of extroverts and universals, then checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts and universals by 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, so the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed by subtracting the number of extroverts and universals from the number of introverts and adding the result of the division of the total number of extroverts and universals by 3.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the number of universals is less than the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts and universals by 3, in which case it outputs -1. It also correctly handles the case where the number of introverts is greater than the number of extroverts and universals, in which case it outputs the correct minimum number of tents needed.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
