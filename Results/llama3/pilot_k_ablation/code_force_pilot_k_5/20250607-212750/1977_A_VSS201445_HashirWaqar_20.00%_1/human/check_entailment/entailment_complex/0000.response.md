Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program checks each test case and prints 'YES' if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even) and n is not less than m, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This is in line with the problem description, which states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after n moves must have the same parity as n.

Correctness: **True**
