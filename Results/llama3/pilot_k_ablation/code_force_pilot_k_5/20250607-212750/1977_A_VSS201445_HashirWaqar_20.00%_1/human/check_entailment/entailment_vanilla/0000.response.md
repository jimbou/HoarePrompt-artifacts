Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
- If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks the parity of both n and m. If both are odd or both are even, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it doesn't print anything, which implies 'NO'.

This logic is correct because:

- If n is less than m, it's indeed impossible to have m cubes.
- If n is greater than or equal to m, the parity of n and m determines the possibility. If both are odd or both are even, it's possible to end up with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in each move. If one is odd and the other is even, it's impossible.

However, the program doesn't explicitly handle the case where n is greater than or equal to m and the parities of n and m are different. But since the problem statement guarantees that the input values are between 1 and 100, and the program doesn't print anything in this case, it implicitly handles it as 'NO'.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
