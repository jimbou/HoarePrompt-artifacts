Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program correctly handles the case where n is less than m. In this case, it's impossible to end up with a tower of m cubes, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

For the case where n is greater than or equal to m, the program checks whether both n and m are odd or both are even. This is because the number of cubes in the tower can only be odd if the number of moves is odd, and only even if the number of moves is even. If both n and m satisfy this condition, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to end up with a tower of m cubes.

However, the program does not handle the case where n is greater than or equal to m, but n and m have different parity (one is odd and the other is even). In this case, it's impossible to end up with a tower of m cubes, so the program should print 'NO'. But the program does not check for this condition.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
