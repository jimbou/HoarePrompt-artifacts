Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in each move, and the goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes after n moves.

The program correctly checks if n is less than m, in which case it's impossible to end up with m cubes, and prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even) using the bitwise AND operator (&) and the modulo operator (%). If they have the same parity, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading test cases from standard input, checking each test case, and printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
