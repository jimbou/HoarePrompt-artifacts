Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases. The problem statement requires that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly m cubes. The program checks if n is less than m, in which case it is not possible to have m cubes, and prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks if both n and m are odd or both are even. If they are, it prints 'YES', because it is possible to have m cubes after n moves. If they are not, it does not print anything, which is correct because it is not possible to have m cubes after n moves in this case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n is less than m, and where n and m have different parities. Therefore, the program is correct.
