Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t-1 is greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, 'YES' is printed if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.***
