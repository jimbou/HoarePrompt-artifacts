Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t is greater than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each with two integers, since one pair of integers has been consumed by the `input().split()` function. The value of `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, but it has not been changed by the code.
