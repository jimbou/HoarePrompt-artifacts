Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t-1 is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one less line of input, since the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0.
