Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m. It then checks each test case and prints 'YES' if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even) and n is not less than m, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the input is exhausted.**
