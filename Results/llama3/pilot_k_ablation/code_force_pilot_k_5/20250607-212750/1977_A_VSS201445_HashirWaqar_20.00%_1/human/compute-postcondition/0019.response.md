To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body. The loop condition is determined by the `range` object, which is created from the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100
* `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100)
* `t` is greater than or equal to 1

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. The loop will execute again if there is another line in `stdin` containing two integers `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

* `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 (no change)
* `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100) (one more line than before)
* `t` is greater than or equal to 2 (since we've already read `t-1` lines)

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is greater than or equal to 2**
