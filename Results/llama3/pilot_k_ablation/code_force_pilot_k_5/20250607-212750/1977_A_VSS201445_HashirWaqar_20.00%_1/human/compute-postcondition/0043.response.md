Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains 0 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is 0. If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input `stdin` will be empty (containing 0 lines), and the values of `n` and `m` will still be integers between 1 and 100. The loop will have printed 'NO' for each pair of `n` and `m` where `n` is less than `m`, and 'YES' for each pair where both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.
