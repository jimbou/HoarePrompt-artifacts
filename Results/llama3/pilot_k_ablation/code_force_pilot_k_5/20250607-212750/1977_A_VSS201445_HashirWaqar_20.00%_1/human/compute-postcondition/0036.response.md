Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is greater than or equal to 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the number of lines in `stdin` has been reduced by 1. The condition that `t` is greater than or equal to 0 is still valid, but now `t` is at least 1 since one line has been read.
