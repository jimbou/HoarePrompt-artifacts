To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution) and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t is greater than 0**
