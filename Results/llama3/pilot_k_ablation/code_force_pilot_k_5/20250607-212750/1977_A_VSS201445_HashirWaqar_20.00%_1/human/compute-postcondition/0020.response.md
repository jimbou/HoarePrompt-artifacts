Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is greater than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The range of values for `n` and `m` remains the same, and the condition on `t` is still valid but has been updated to be greater than or equal to 1.
