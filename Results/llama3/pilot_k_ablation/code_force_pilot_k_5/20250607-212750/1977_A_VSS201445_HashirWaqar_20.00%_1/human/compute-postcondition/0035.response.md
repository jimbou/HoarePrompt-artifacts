State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is greater than or equal to 0. If `n` < `m`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.**
