The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t-1 is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain an integer t (0 <= t <= 99) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 99) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t is greater than or equal to 1**
