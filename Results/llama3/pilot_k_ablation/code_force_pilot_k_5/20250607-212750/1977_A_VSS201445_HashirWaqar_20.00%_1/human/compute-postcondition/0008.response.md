Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and t-1 is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. The current values of `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, and 'YES' is being printed**
