To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute as long as there are more lines in the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m`. To execute the loop again, there must be at least one more line in `stdin`.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
