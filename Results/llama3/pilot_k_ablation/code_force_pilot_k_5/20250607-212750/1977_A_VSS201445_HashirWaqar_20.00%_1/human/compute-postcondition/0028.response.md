Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), and `t` is greater than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the integers read from the first line of the input. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, since one line has been read. The remaining lines in `stdin` still contain two integers each, and the total number of lines `t` is still greater than or equal to 1.
