Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32. The current value of `cur` has a bit set at position `j` (i.e., `(cur >> j & 1)` is True).***
