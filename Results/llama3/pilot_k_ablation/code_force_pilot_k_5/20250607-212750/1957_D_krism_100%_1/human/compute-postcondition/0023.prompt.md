Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0], stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each
Code of the loop:
for i in range(32):
    pre[i][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[1, 0]` at index `i` and `[0, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 32

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[2, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 31

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[3, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 32

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[4, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 31

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[5, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 32




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
