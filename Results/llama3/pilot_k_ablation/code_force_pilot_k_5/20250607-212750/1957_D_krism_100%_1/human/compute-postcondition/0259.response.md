Output State: **n is at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [33, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-33], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n + 2, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][1] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][1] is decremented by 1. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][0] is decremented by 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `y`, `k`, `ans`, and `c`. The value of `y` is set to the `i`th element of `arr`, which is an integer. The value of `k` is set to the bit length of `y` minus 1. The value of `ans` is incremented by the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, where `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1. The value of `c` is set to the `i`th element of `prefix`, which is an integer. The code also modifies the values of `pre` and `suf` based on the bits of `c`. If the `j`th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. If the `j`th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.
