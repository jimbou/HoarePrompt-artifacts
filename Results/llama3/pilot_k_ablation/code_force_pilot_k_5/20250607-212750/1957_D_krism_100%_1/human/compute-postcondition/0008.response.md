Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 4 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least seven elements: 0, `v`, the next element in the list, `v` XOR the next element in the list, `v` XOR the next element in the list XOR the next element in the list, `v` XOR the last element in the list, and `v` XOR the last element in the list XOR `v`, `v` is the fourth element in the list**

In this output state, the `prefix` list has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the XOR operation between the last element in the `prefix` list and `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is still an integer, and `arr` is still a list of n integers with at least 4 elements.
