Output State: **stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing a single element 0.**

In this output state, the first line of the code reads an integer t from stdin, which is not stored in any variable but is used to determine the number of blocks of input to read. The second line reads a block of two lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. These values are stored in the variables n and arr, respectively. The third line initializes a list prefix with a single element 0. 

Note that the value of t is not stored in any variable, so it is not included in the output state. The value of stdin is updated to reflect that one block of input has been read.
