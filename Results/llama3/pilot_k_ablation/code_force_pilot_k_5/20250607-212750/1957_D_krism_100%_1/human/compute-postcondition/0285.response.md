Output: **The sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 (where pre[k][0] is 32 if the kth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is n, pre[k][1] is n if the kth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is 0, suf[k][0] is 1 if the kth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is 0, suf[k][1] is 0 if the kth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is n, and cur is the XOR of all elements in arr)**
