State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [32+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i] if the jth bit of cur is 1 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+1] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i] if the jth bit of cur is 0 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-1], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n+1, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix**
