Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [33, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-33], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n+1, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
