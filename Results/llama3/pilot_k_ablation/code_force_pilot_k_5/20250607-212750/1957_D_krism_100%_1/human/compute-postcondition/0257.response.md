Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [33, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-33], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n+1, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][1] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][1] is decremented by 1. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][0] is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being in the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates 32 times, and in each iteration, it updates the values of pre and suf based on the jth bit of c. After the loop finishes, the values of pre and suf are updated accordingly, and the value of j is 32. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
