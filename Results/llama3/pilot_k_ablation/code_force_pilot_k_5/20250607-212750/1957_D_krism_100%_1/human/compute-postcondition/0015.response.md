The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 32. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and must be less than 32.
State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[1, 0]` at index `i` and `[0, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 31**
