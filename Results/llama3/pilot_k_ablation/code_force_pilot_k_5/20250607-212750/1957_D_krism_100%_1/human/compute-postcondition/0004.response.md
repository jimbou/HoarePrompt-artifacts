Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least four elements: 0, `v`, the next element in the list, and `v` XOR the next element in the list, `v` is the second element in the list**

In this output state, the `prefix` list has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element in the `prefix` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
