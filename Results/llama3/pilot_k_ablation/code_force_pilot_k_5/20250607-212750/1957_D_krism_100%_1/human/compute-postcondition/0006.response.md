Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least six elements: 0, `v`, the next element in the list, `v` XOR the next element in the list, `v` XOR the next element in the list XOR the next element in the list, and `v` XOR the last element in the list, `v` is the third element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is that the `prefix` list has been extended by one element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element in the `prefix` list and the value `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
