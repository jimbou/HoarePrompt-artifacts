Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, 1] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [33, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-2] if the jth bit of cur is 1 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [n, 0] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-1] if the jth bit of cur is 0 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-2], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is 1, j is 2, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. If the jth bit of c is 1, then pre[j][1] is 3 and suf[j][1] is n-4. If the jth bit of c is 0, then pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [33, 1] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [34, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [0, n-3] if the jth bit of cur is 1 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [n, -1] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-2] if the jth bit of cur is 0 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-3].**

The code modifies the values of `pre[j][1]` and `suf[j][1]` based on the value of the jth bit of `c`. If the jth bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. If the jth bit of `c` is 0, the values of `pre` and `suf` are updated accordingly. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
