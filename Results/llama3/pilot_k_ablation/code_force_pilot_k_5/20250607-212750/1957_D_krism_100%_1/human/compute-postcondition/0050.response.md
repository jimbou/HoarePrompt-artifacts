Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, j+1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `suf` list has been updated such that for each bit position `j`, if the `j`th bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j]` is `[j+1, 0]`, otherwise it is `[0, j+1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
