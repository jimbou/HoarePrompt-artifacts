Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 2. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is 2. Otherwise, `suf[1][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1. This means that if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1, and if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][0]` is still increased by 1, but `suf[1][0]` is also increased by 1.
