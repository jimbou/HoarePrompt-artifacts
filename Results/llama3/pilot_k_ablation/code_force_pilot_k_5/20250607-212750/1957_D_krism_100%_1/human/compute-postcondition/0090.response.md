Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 35] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 33] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 30, `i` is 30, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is at least 2 and less than 32.**

The code increments the second element of the jth sublist in `suf` by 1. Since `suf[j]` is either [j+1, 34] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 or [j+2, 32] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, the updated value of `suf[j]` will be [j+1, 35] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 or [j+2, 33] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
