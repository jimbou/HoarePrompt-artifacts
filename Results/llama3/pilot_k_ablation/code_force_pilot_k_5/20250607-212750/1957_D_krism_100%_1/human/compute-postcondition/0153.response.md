Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is [0, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and `j` is 1, otherwise it is [1, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and `j` is not 1, otherwise it is [2, 0], except for `suf[2]` which is [1, 1] if the 2nd bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 2], except for `suf[3]` which is [1, 1] if the 3rd bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 2], except for `suf[3][0]` which is 2 if the 3rd bit of `cur` is 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[4][1]` is 1 plus its previous value, otherwise `suf[4][0]` is increased by 1. `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 28, `i` is 28, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `j` is 31.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 5 times, except that `j` is 31 instead of 4. This means that the loop has finished executing and all the bits of `cur` have been processed. The values of `suf[j]` have been updated accordingly based on the bits of `cur`.
