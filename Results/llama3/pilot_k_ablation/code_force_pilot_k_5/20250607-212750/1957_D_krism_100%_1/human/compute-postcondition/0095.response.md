Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is updated to [j+2, 33] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [j+1, 35], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 30, `i` is 30, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is at least 3 and less than 32, and `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, except for `suf[j][0]`, which is incremented by 1. The value of `suf[j][0]` is now `j+2` if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is `j+1`.
