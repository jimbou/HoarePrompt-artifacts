According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 32, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is at least 0 and less than 32.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is [0, `n-1`] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is [`n`, 0], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0]` * `suf[k][0]` + `pre[k][1]` * `suf[k][1]` for `k` from 0 to 31, `y` is the ith element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is the ith element of `prefix`**
