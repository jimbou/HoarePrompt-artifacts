Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where `suf[j]` is [0, 1] and all other sublists are [0, 0], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, and `(cur >> j & 1)` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while all other values remain the same. The rest of the variables, including `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `cur`, `i`, and stdin, are unchanged. The condition `(cur >> j & 1)` is still True, indicating that the current value of `cur` still has a bit set at position `j`.
