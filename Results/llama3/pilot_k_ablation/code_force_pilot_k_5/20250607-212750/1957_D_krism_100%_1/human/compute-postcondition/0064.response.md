Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1. Specifically, if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is now [j+1, 3], and if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j]` is now [j+2, 2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
