The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 31. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. However, since `j` is already 31, which is the maximum value in the range, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, the state of `j` should be adjusted to be out of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 1] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32**
