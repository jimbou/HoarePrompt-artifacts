Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 4] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is [j+1, 4], otherwise `suf[j]` is [j+2, 3].***
