Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [33, i+4] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n+1, -i+2] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [34, i+2] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [34+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [0, n-i-3] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n-1, -i-1] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [-1, n-i-1] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [-1, n-i-2], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n, j is at least 4 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix.**

The code modifies the values of `pre[j][0]` and `suf[j][0]`. Specifically, it increments `pre[j][0]` by 1 and decrements `suf[j][0]` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
