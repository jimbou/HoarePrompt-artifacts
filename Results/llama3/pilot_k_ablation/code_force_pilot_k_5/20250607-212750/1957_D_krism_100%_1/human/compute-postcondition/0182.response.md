The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n+1` and `n` must be greater than `n+1` which is not possible. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`. So `n` must be greater than `n`. However, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `n`.
