Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 5 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least eight elements: 0, `v`, the next element in the list, `v` XOR the next element in the list, `v` XOR the next element in the list XOR the next element in the list, `v` XOR the last element in the list, `v` XOR the last element in the list XOR `v`, and `v` XOR the last element in the list XOR `v` XOR `v`, `v` is the fifth element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `prefix` has been updated by appending a new element that is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element in the `prefix` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
