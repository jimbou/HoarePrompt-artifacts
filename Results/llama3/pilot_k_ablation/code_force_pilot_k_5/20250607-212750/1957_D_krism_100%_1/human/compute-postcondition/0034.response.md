Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `j` is 1, and `suf[j][1]` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The 2D list `suf` still contains 32 sublists, but the second element of the sublist at index `j` (which is 1) has been incremented. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
