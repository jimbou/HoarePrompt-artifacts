Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, j+1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if cur >> j & 1:
        suf[j][1] += 1
    else:
        suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 1] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is at least 0 and less than 32.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 1] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j]` is updated to [j+1, 2] and if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j]` is updated to [j+2, 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is [j+1, 3], otherwise `suf[j]` is [j+2, 2].

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 4] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is [j+1, 4], otherwise `suf[j]` is [j+2, 3].

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 5] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and `cur` is shifted right by `j` and the least significant bit is 1, or [j+2, 4] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0 and `cur` is shifted right by `j` and the least significant bit is 1, or [j+2, 4] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and `cur` is shifted right by `j` and the least significant bit is 0, or [j+3, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0 and `cur` is shifted right by `j` and the least significant bit is 0, `j` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
