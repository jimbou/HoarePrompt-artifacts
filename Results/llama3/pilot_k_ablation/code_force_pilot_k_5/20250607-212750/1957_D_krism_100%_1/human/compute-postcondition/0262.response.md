Output State: **n is at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i+33] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+31] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [33, i+33] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 1], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i-33] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i-33] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-33] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-34], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n + 2, j is at least 0 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. The jth bit of c is 1.**

Explanation:
The code increments `pre[j][1]` by 1 and decrements `suf[j][1]` by 1. This means that the value of `pre[j][1]` is now `i+33` and the value of `suf[j][1]` is now `n-i-33`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
