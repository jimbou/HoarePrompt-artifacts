Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is updated according to the jth bit of `cur`. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is updated to [j+1, 34] and `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j]` is updated to [j+2, 33] and `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 30, `i` is 30, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 5 times, except that `j` is now 32, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `suf[j]` have been updated according to the jth bit of `cur`, and the values of `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` have been incremented accordingly.
