Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[4]` which is now [1, 1] or [0, 2] if the 4th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is [2, 0] or [1, 1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 31. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is 32. Otherwise, `suf[1][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[3][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[4][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[5][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[6][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[7][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[8][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[9][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[10][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[11][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[12][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[13][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[14][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[15][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[16][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[17][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[18][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[19][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[20][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[21][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[22][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[23][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[24][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[25][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[26][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[27][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[28][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[29][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[30][0]` is increased by 1, and `suf[31][0]` is increased by 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `suf` list is updated such that each sublist contains the count of 0s and 1s in the corresponding bit position of the `cur` variable. The `j` variable is now 31, indicating that the loop has completed all 32 iterations. The other variables remain unchanged.
