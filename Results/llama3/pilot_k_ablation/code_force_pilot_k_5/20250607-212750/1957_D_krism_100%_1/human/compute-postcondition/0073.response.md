Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+2, 4] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+3, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `pre` remains the same. The value of `suf` is updated such that the first element of the second sublist (`suf[1]`) is incremented by 1. The rest of the sublists in `suf` remain the same. The value of `j` is still 1.
