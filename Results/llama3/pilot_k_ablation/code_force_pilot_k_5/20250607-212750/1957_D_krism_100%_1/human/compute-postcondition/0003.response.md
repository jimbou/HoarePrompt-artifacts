To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `v` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one element, `v` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `v` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least three elements: 0, `v`, and the next element in the list, `v` is the second element in the list**
