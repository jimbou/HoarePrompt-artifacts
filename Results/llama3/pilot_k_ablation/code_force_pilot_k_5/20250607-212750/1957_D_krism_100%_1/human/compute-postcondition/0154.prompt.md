Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0], stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, i is equal to 32
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, j+1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 32] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+2, 31] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is updated according to the jth bit of `cur`. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is updated to [j+1, 34] and `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j]` is updated to [j+2, 33] and `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 30, `i` is 30, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is [0, 1] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is [1, 1]. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1. `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 29, `i` is 29, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32. The value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1, depending on whether the jth bit of `cur` is 1 or 0, respectively.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all 32 bits of the `cur` variable, updating the `suf` list accordingly. The `j` variable has reached its maximum value of 32, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is [0, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and `j` is 1, otherwise it is [1, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and `j` is not 1, otherwise it is [2, 0], except for `suf[2]` which is [1, 1] if the 2nd bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 2], except for `suf[3]` which is [1, 1] if the 3rd bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 2], except for `suf[3][0]` which is 2 if the 3rd bit of `cur` is 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[4][1]` is 1 plus its previous value, otherwise `suf[4][0]` is increased by 1. `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 28, `i` is 28, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `j` is 31.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 5 times, except that `j` is 31 instead of 4. This means that the loop has finished executing and all the bits of `cur` have been processed. The values of `suf[j]` have been updated accordingly based on the bits of `cur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
