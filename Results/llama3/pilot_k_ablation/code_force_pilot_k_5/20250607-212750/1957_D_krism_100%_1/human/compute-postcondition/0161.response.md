Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, 1], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-2] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, 0], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is 1, j is at least 0 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. The current value of c has a 1 in the jth bit position.**

In this output state, the value of `pre[j][1]` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `suf[j][1]` has been decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
