Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [33, i] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [32+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [0, n-i] if the jth bit of cur is 1 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+1] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i] if the jth bit of cur is 0 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-1], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n, j is at least 0 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. The jth bit of c is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` remains at least 2, and the list `arr` still contains `n` integers. The `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`. The 2D list `pre` has been modified, where the `jth` sublist is now `[33, i]` if the `jth` bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is `[32+i, 0]`. The 2D list `suf` has also been modified, where the `jth` sublist is now `[0, n-i]` if the `jth` bit of `cur` is 1 and the `jth` bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is `[n, -i+1]` if the `jth` bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is `[0, n-i]` if the `jth` bit of `cur` is 0 and the `jth` bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is `[0, n-i-1]`. The value of `cur` remains the XOR of all elements in `arr`, and `i` is still `n`. The value of `j` remains at least 0 and less than 32. The value of `ans` has been updated to include the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for `k` from 0 to 31, plus `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` where `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1 and `y` is the `ith` element of `arr`. The value of `y` is still the `ith` element of `arr`, and `k` is still the bit length of `y` minus 1. The value of `c` is still the `ith` element of `prefix`, and the `jth` bit of `c` is 0.
