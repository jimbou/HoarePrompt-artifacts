Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, `i`] if the jth bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is [32+`i`, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, `n-`i] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and the jth bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is [n, -`i+1`] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is [0, `n-`i] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0 and the jth bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is [0, `n-`i-1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0]` * `suf[k][0]` + `pre[k][1]` * `suf[k][1]` for `k` from 0 to 31 plus `pre[k][0]` * `suf[k][0]` + `pre[k][1]` * `suf[k][1]` where `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1 and `y` is the ith element of `arr`, `y` is the ith element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is the ith element of `prefix`. The current value of `c` has a 1 at the jth bit position.**
