To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 32 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1 (since the loop iterates in reverse order), so `i` becomes 31.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, j+1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 32**
