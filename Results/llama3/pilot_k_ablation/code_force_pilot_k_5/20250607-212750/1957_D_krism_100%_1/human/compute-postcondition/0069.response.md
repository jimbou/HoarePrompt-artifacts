Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is now [j+2, 3] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, or [j+3, 2] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 31, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 33. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is [j+2, 3], otherwise `suf[j]` is [j+3, 2].**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suf[j]` depends on the jth bit of `cur`, which is either 1 or 0. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j]` is now [j+2, 3], otherwise it is [j+3, 2].
