Output: **n is at least 1, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, n] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix, and the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 which is ans is being printed**
