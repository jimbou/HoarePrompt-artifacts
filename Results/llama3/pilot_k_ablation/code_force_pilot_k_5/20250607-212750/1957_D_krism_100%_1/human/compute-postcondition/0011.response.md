Output State: **stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr.**

In this output state, the loop has executed for all iterations, and the prefix list now contains n+1 elements, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the XOR of all elements in the arr list. The stdin and n variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
