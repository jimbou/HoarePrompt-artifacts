Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] and all other sublists are [0, 0], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, and the jth bit of `cur` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and the jth bit of `cur` is still 0.
