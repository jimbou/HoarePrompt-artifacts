Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be the XOR of all elements in `arr`, which is the value of `prefix[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each.
