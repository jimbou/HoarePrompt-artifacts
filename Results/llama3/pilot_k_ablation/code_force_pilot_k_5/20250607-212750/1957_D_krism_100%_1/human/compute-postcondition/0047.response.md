Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[4]` which is now [2, 0] or [1, 1], `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `i` is 32, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is 4**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `suf[j]`, which has been updated. Specifically, `suf[4]` now has its first element incremented by 1, resulting in either [2, 0] or [1, 1], depending on the initial value of `cur`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
