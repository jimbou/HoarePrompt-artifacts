Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [33, 1] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [34, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [0, n-3] if the jth bit of cur is 1 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [n, -1] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-2] if the jth bit of cur is 0 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-3], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is 1, j is 2, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. If the jth bit of c is 1, then pre[j][1] is 2 and suf[j][1] is n-3. If the jth bit of c is 0, then pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [33, 1] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [34, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [0, n-3] if the jth bit of cur is 1 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [n, -1] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-2] if the jth bit of cur is 0 and the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-3].**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` remains at least 2. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers. The list `prefix` still contains `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`. The 2D list `pre` has been modified such that the jth sublist is now [33, 1] if the jth bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is [34, 0]. The 2D list `suf` has also been modified such that the jth sublist is now [0, `n-3`] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1 and the jth bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is [`n`, -1] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is [0, `n-2`] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0 and the jth bit of `c` is 1, otherwise it is [0, `n-3`]. The value of `cur` remains the XOR of all elements in `arr`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.
