Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [33, i+3] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+1] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [32, i+2] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [0, n-i-2] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-1] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-2], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n, j is at least 3 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix. If the jth bit of c is 1, then the jth sublist of pre is [33, i+3] and the jth sublist of suf is [0, n-i-2] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+1]. If the jth bit of c is 0, then the jth sublist of pre is [32, i+2] and the jth sublist of suf is [0, n-i-2] if the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n+1, -i].**

In this final state, the values of `pre` and `suf` have been modified according to the given conditions. The `pre` list now contains sublists where the first element is either 32, 33, or 33+i, and the second element is either i+2, i+3, or 0, depending on the bits of `c` and `cur`. The `suf` list now contains sublists where the first element is either 0 or n, and the second element is either n-i-1, n-i-2, or -i, depending on the bits of `c` and `cur`. The value of `ans` has also been updated to include the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of `pre` and `suf`.
