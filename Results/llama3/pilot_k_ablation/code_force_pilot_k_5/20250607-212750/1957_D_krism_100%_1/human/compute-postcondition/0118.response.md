The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2 and less than 32. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, 0] if the jth bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is [0, 1], except for `suf[j]` which is [0, 1] if the jth bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is [1, 1]. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1. `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index 29, `i` is 29, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, and `j` is at least 3 and less than 32. The value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1, depending on whether the jth bit of `cur` is 1 or 0, respectively.**
