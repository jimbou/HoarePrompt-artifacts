The code `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends a new element to the `prefix` list. The new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list (`prefix[-1]`).

Since `prefix` initially contains a single element `0`, `prefix[-1]` is `0`. Therefore, the new element appended to `prefix` is simply `v`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, `prefix` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `v`, `v` is the first element in the list.**
