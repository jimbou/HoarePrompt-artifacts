Output State: **n is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr, pre is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [33, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 0], suf is a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-33], cur is the XOR of all elements in arr, i is n+1, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31 plus pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1 and y is the ith element of arr, y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix.**

The code executes the following operations:

1.  Assigns the value of the ith element of arr to y.
2.  Calculates the bit length of y minus 1 and assigns it to k.
3.  Adds the product of pre\[k]\[0] and suf\[k]\[0] plus the product of pre\[k]\[1] and suf\[k]\[1] to ans.
4.  Assigns the ith element of prefix to c.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

*   n remains at least 2.
*   arr remains a list of n integers.
*   prefix remains a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the XOR of all elements in arr.
*   pre remains a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [32, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i+32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [33, i+32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [33+i, 0].
*   suf remains a 2D list containing 32 sublists, where the jth sublist is [1, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [n, -i-32] if the jth bit of c is 1 and the jth bit of cur is 0, otherwise it is [0, n-i-32] if the jth bit of c is 0 and the jth bit of cur is 1, otherwise it is [0, n-i-33].
*   cur remains the XOR of all elements in arr.
*   i remains n+1.
*   j remains 32.
*   ans is updated to include the additional products of pre\[k]\[0] and suf\[k]\[0] plus pre\[k]\[1] and suf\[k]\[1] for k from 0 to 31.
*   y is assigned the value of the ith element of arr.
*   k is assigned the bit length of y minus 1.
*   c is assigned the ith element of prefix.
