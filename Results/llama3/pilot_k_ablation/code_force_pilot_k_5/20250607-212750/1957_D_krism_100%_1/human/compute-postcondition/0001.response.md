To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `v` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `arr` must have at least 1 element and `v` is the first element in the list.

State: **stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, prefix is a list containing a single element 0, v is the first element in the list**
