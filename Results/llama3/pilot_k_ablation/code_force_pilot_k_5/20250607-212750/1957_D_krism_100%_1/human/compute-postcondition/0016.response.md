Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[2, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 31**

In this output state, the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `[2, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
