The value of `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `pre[i][0]` was 2 before, so the value of `pre[i][0]` is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[3, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `i` is less than 32.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `pre` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[3, 0]` at index `i` and `[1, 0]` at other indices, `suf` is a 2D list containing `32` sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, `i` is less than 32**
