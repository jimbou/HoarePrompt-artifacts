Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It first calculates the prefix XOR array, which is used to efficiently calculate the XOR of any subarray. Then, it initializes two arrays, `pre` and `suf`, to keep track of the number of elements with a certain bit set or unset in the prefix and suffix arrays, respectively.

The program then iterates over the array, updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays and calculating the number of tuples that satisfy the condition. The condition is satisfied when the XOR of the subarray from `x` to `y` and the XOR of the subarray from `y` to `z` is greater than the XOR of the subarray from `x` to `z`. This is equivalent to checking if the bit at the position of the most significant bit of `y` is set in the `pre` array and unset in the `suf` array, or vice versa.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `x`, `y`, and `z` are equal, and when the array contains only one element. It also correctly handles the case when the most significant bit of `y` is not set in the `pre` array or unset in the `suf` array.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
