Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.
