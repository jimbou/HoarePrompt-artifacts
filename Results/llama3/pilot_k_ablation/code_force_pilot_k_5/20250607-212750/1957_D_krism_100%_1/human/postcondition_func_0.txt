This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the sum of products of certain bit counts. It takes no arguments and returns no value. The input is expected to contain multiple blocks of two lines each, where the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the XOR of all elements in each block, then updates two 2D lists (pre and suf) based on the bits of the XOR value. Finally, it calculates and prints the sum of products of certain bit counts from the pre and suf lists.
