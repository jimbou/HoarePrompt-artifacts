This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains parameters n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers. It calculates the total count of "beautiful pairs" for each test case, where a beautiful pair is defined as two numbers that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case, and empties the input list of test cases.
