Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The program uses a frequency map to store the count of numbers with specific modulo values for x and y. It then iterates through the array, for each number, it calculates the required modulo values for x and y to form a beautiful pair, and checks if such a pair exists in the frequency map. If it does, it increments the beautiful count. The program handles all possible cases, including when x or y is 1, and when the array contains duplicate numbers. 

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. The use of a frequency map allows it to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs in the array, and the program's loop structure ensures that it checks all possible pairs. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
