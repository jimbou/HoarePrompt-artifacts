Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, as defined in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2.  The `func_1` function iterates over each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
3.  For each number in the array, it calculates the required modular values (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`) that would make a pair beautiful.
4.  It uses a dictionary (`freq`) to store the frequency of each modular value pair. This allows it to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs.
5.  The program correctly updates the `beautiful_count` variable by adding the frequency of the required modular value pair.
6.  Finally, the program returns a list of beautiful pair counts, one for each test case.

The execution summary also confirms that the program processes the input correctly and returns the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
