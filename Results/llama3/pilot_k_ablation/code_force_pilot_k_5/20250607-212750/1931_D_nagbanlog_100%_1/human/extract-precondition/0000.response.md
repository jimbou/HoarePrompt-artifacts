Precondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.**
