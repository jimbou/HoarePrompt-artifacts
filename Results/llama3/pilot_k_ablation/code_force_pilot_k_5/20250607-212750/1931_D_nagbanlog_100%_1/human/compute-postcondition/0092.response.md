Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'], freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and no elements, beautiful_count is 0, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the nth element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the same as mod_y.**

The code reassigns the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` from the current `case` in `test_cases`. It also resets `freq` to an empty defaultdict and `beautiful_count` to 0. The value of `beautiful_count` is added to the `results` list. The state of `test_cases`, `case`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
