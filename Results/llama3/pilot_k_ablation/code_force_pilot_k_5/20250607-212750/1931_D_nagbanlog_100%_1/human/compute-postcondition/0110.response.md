Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 4 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is two more than its previous frequency, beautiful_count is either the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, or remains unchanged, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the fourth element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y.**

The code snippet modifies the values of mod_x, mod_y, required_mod_x, and required_mod_y. The first line calculates the remainder of num divided by x and assigns it to mod_x. The second line calculates the remainder of num divided by y and assigns it to mod_y. The third line calculates the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x and assigns it to required_mod_x. The fourth line assigns the value of mod_y to required_mod_y. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
