Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of n more than before, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the nth element of a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables n, x, y, a, freq, beautiful_count, results, test_cases, case, num, mod_x, required_mod_x, required_mod_y, and mod_y have the same values as they did after the loop executed 5 times, except that the frequency of the pair (mod_x, mod_y) in freq is now n more than before, and beautiful_count has been increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.
