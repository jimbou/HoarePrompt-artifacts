Output State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency that is equal to the number of times the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) appears in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` for all (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in `a`, `results` contains `n+1` additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least `n` more elements than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the `n`th element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that the `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `beautiful_count`.
