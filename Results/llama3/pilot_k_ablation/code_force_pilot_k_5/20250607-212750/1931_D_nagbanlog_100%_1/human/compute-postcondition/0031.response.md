To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the list has at least 2 test cases, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, and `case` is the first test case in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases, and `case` must be the second test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list with one element which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is increased by 1, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.**
