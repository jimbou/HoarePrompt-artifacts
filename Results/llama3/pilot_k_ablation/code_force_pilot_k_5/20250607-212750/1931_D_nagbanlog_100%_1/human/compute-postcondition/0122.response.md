Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and is empty, beautiful_count is 0, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is not defined, mod_x is not defined, mod_y is not defined, required_mod_x is not defined, required_mod_y is not defined.**

The code snippet provided assigns the values of `case['params']` to `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the value of `case['array']` to `a`. It also initializes `freq` as an empty defaultdict with a default value of 0 and sets `beautiful_count` to 0. The values of `results`, `test_cases`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are not affected by this code snippet.
