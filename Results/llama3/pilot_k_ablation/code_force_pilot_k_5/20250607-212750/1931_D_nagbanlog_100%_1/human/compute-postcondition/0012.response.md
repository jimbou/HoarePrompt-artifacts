Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, and freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] is increased by 1. If the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y).***
