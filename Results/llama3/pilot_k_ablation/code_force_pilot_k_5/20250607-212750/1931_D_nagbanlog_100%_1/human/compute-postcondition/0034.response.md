Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list with one element which is the value of beautiful_count, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, and beautiful_count is 0**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables except for `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`. The first line assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `x` to `mod_x`. The second line assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to `mod_y`. The third line assigns the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` to `required_mod_x`. The fourth line assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
