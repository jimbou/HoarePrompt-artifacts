Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list with one element which is the value of beautiful_count, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'], num is the last element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, and beautiful_count is 0.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`. The code only reassigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from `case['params']`, and `a` from `case['array']`, but these values remain the same as in the initial state. The code also initializes `freq` as a dictionary with default value 0 and resets `beautiful_count` to 0.
