Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 2 more than before, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the third element of a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`. The first line calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. The second line calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. The third line calculates the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and assigns it to `required_mod_x`. The fourth line assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. 

The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `results`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `num` remain unchanged.
