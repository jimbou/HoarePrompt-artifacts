Output State: **results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 4 elements, num is the fourth element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the same as mod_y, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and at least one element (mod_x, mod_y), freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 2, and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, otherwise, beautiful_count remains unchanged.**

The code snippet updates the values of mod_x, mod_y, and required_mod_x. The first line assigns the remainder of num divided by x to mod_x. The second line assigns the remainder of num divided by y to mod_y. The third line assigns the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x to required_mod_x. The fourth line assigns the same value as mod_y to required_mod_y. The values of required_mod_x and required_mod_y are used to determine the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, which affects the value of beautiful_count.
