According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, beautiful_count is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 element and the num is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
