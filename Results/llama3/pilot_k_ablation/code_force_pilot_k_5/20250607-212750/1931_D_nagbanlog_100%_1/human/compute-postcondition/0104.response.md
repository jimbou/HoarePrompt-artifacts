The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the num is the third element in the list.
State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is one more than its previous frequency, beautiful_count is either 0 or the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the third element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y. If (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq. Otherwise, beautiful_count remains unchanged, and the frequency of the pair (mod_x, mod_y) in freq is increased by 1.**
