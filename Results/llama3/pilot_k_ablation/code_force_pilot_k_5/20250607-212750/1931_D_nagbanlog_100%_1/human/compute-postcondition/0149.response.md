Output State: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of `n` more than before, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `results` contains `n+1` additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the last element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all elements in the array `a`, and the frequency dictionary `freq` now contains the frequency of each pair of remainders modulo `x` and `y` for all elements in `a`. The `beautiful_count` variable has been updated to reflect the total count of pairs that satisfy the condition. The `results` list now contains the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration. The `test_cases` list has been updated to reflect the next unprocessed test case, and the `case` variable points to the next test case. The `num` variable holds the last element of the array `a`, and the `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and `mod_y` variables hold the corresponding remainders and required remainders for the last element.
