Output State: **results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'], freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and no elements, beautiful_count is 0**

The code block extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from `case['params']` and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. It also assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. Additionally, it initializes a defaultdict `freq` with default value 0 and no elements, and sets the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. The variables `results` and `test_cases` are not modified by this code block, so their states remain the same as in the initial state.
