Output State: **`results` contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and at least one element (`mod_x`, `mod_y`), `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq`, and `beautiful_count` has been incremented by the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The frequency of the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in the `freq` dictionary has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `results` still containing an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, and `test_cases` still having at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain the same.
