Postcondition: ***n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the first element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y. If the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then freq contains the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
