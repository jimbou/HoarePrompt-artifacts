Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `num` is still the first element in the list `a`. The new variables `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are introduced with their respective values calculated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`.
