Output State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 1 more than before, `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. If the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is present in `freq`, then `freq` contains the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in `freq`.**

The code increments the frequency of the pair (mod_x, mod_y) in the defaultdict `freq` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
