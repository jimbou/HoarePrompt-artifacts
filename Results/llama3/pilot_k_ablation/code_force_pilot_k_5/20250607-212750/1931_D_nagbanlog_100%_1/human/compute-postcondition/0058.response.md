Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list with two elements which are the values of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 5 elements, `num` is the fifth element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 where the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been increased by 1. This means that the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
