Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and no elements, beautiful_count is 0, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the first element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`. The first line assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `x` to `mod_x`. The second line assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to `mod_y`. The third line assigns the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` to `required_mod_x`. The fourth line assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are affected.
