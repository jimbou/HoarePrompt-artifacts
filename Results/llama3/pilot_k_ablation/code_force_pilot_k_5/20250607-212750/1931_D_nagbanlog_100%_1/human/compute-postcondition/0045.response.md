Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list with one element which is the value of beautiful_count, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0 where the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, and beautiful_count is increased by the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq. Otherwise, beautiful_count remains unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`. The new values of these variables are calculated based on the previous values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `required_mod_y` is set to be equal to `mod_y`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
