The only variable in the loop head is `case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the `test_cases` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least `n` more elements than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `test_cases` must have at least one more element and the `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`.
State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency that is equal to the number of times the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) appears in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` for all (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in `a`, `results` contains `n+1` additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the `n`th element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
