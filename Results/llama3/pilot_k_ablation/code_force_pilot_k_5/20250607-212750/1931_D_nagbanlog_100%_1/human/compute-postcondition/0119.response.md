Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is equal to the number of times the pair (mod_x, mod_y) appears in a, beautiful_count is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq for all (mod_x, mod_y) in a, results contains n additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least n more elements than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the nth element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, where n is the first element of case['params']. The array a has at least n elements, and the frequency dictionary freq contains the frequency of each pair (mod_x, mod_y) in a. The beautiful_count variable is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq for all (mod_x, mod_y) in a. The results list contains n additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration. The test_cases list has at least n more elements than it did at the end of the previous iteration, and the case variable is the next unprocessed element in test_cases. The num variable is the nth element in a, and the mod_x and mod_y variables are the remainders of num divided by x and y, respectively. The required_mod_x and required_mod_y variables are the remainders of x minus mod_x divided by x and mod_y, respectively.
