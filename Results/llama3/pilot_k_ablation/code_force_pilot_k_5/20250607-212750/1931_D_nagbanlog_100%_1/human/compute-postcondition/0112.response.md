Postcondition: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 4 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is two more than its previous frequency, `beautiful_count` is either the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, or remains unchanged, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the fourth element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is mod_y.**
