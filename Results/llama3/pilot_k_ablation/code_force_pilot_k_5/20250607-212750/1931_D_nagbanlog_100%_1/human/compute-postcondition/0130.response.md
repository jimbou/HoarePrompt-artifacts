Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 1 more than before, beautiful_count is 0, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the second element of a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.**

The code block calculates the values of mod_x, mod_y, required_mod_x, and required_mod_y based on the values of num, x, and y. The value of mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y. The values of n, x, y, a, freq, beautiful_count, results, test_cases, and case remain unchanged.
