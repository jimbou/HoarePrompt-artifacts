Output State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y), `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the first element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y. The pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables retain their previous values except for `beautiful_count`, which is incremented by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in the frequency dictionary `freq`.
