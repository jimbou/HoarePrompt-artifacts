Output State: **n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and is empty, beautiful_count is 0, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the first element of a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.**

In this output state, the values of n, x, y, a, freq, beautiful_count, results, test_cases, and case remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of num is still the first element of a. The new variables mod_x, mod_y, required_mod_x, and required_mod_y are introduced, with mod_x being the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y being the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x being the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y being the same as mod_y.
