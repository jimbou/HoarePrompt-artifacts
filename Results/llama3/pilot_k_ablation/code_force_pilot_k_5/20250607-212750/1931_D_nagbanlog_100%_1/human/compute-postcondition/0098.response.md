Output State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency that is one more than its previous frequency, `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq`, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The frequency of the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in the `freq` dictionary is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `test_cases`, `case`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` retaining their previous values. The `beautiful_count` variable either remains 0 or is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq`, depending on whether the pair is present in `freq`. The `results` list contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`.
