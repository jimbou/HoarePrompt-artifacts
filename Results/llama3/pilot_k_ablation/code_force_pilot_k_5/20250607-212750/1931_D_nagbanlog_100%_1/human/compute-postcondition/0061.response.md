To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change.

The loop head is `for case in test_cases:`. The variables in the loop head are `case` and `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has finished executing all iterations, which means that `case` has taken on the value of each element in `test_cases` and the loop has exhausted all elements in `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet. This means that `test_cases` must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

The state of `results` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`results` contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`**
