Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `results`, which is an empty list. The rest of the information from the initial state is still valid, including the constraints on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a_i` in each test case.
