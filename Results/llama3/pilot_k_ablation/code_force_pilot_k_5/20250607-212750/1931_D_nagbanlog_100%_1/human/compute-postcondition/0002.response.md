Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'], freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0**

The code snippet assigns values from the first test case in the list to the variables n, x, y, and a. It also initializes an empty dictionary freq and a variable beautiful_count to 0. The values of t, test_cases, and results remain unchanged.
