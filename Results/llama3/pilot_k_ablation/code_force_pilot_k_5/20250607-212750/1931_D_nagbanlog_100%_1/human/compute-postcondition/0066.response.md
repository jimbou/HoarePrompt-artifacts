Output State: **`results` contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and at least one element (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`), and `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values, except for `beautiful_count`, which is incremented by the frequency of the pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in the `freq` dictionary. The `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the updated value of `beautiful_count`.
