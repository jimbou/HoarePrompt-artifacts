Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and is empty, beautiful_count is 0, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is not defined, mod_x is not defined, mod_y is not defined, required_mod_x is not defined, required_mod_y is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 1 more than before, `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. If the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is present in `freq`, then `freq` contains the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in `freq`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 2 more than before, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the second element of a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 3 more than before, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `results` contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the third element of a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 4 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 4 more than before, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, results contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the fourth element of a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 5 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 5 more than before, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `results` contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the fifth element of a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
