Output State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency of `n` more than before, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, `results` contains `n+2` additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the `n`th element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the current value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of the program is updated to reflect the addition of a new element to the `results` list.
