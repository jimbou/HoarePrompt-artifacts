Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration of the loop.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `test_cases` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed, and the list `results` contains the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration of the loop, representing the total count of beautiful pairs for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and `freq` are no longer relevant as the loop has finished executing.
