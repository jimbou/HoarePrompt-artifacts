Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 4 elements, num is the fourth element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, and freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] is increased by 1, and beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) if the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`. The first line calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. The second line calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. The third line calculates the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and assigns it to `required_mod_x`. The fourth line assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. The values of `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` and `beautiful_count` are not modified by this code snippet.
