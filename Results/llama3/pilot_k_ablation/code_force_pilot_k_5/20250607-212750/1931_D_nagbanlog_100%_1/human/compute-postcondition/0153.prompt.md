Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    beautiful_count = 0
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list with one element which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is increased by 1, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `results` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`. The loop has finished executing all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the nth element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and at least one element (mod_x, mod_y), `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, otherwise, beautiful_count remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency that is equal to the number of times the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) appears in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` for all (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in `a`, `results` contains `n+1` additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least `n` more elements than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the `n`th element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency of `n` more than before, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, `results` contains `n+2` additional elements, which are the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the `n`th element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
