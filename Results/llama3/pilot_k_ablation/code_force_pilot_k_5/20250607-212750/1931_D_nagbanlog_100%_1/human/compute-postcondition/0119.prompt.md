Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'], freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and no elements, beautiful_count is 0, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the nth element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the same as mod_y.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency that is one more than its previous frequency, `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq`, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in `test_cases`, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, freq is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is one more than its previous frequency, beautiful_count is either 0 or the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, results contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, test_cases has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, case is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, num is the second element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y. If (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq. Otherwise, beautiful_count remains unchanged, and the frequency of the pair (mod_x, mod_y) in freq is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is two more than its previous frequency, `beautiful_count` is either the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, or remains unchanged, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the third element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 4 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is one more than its previous frequency, `beautiful_count` is either the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, or remains unchanged, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the fourth element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is mod_y.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 5 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency that is two more than its previous frequency, `beautiful_count` is either the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, or remains unchanged, `results` contains an additional element, which is the value of beautiful_count, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the fifth element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is mod_y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
