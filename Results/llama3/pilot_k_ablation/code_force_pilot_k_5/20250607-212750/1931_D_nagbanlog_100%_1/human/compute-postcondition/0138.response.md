Output State: **`n` is the first element of case['params'], `x` is the second element of case['params'], `y` is the third element of case['params'], `a` is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (mod_x, mod_y) with a frequency of 3 more than before, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `results` contains n+1 additional elements, which are the values of beautiful_count after each iteration, `test_cases` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `case` is the next unprocessed element in test_cases, `num` is the third element of a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y.**

In this output state, the frequency of the pair (mod_x, mod_y) in the defaultdict `freq` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
