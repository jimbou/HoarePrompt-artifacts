Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list of `t` elements where each element is the value of `beautiful_count` after each iteration of the loop, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` of the last test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` of the last test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` of the last test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` of the last test case in `test_cases`, `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with a frequency that is equal to the number of times the pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) appears in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` for all (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in `a`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `test_cases` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list `results` contains the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration of the loop, which represents the number of beautiful pairs found in each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
