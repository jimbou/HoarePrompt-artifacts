#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `test_cases` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed, and the list `results` contains the values of `beautiful_count` after each iteration of the loop, representing the total count of beautiful pairs for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and `freq` are no longer relevant as the loop has finished executing.
    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' containing the values of 'beautiful_count' after each iteration of the loop, representing the total count of beautiful pairs for each test case. The list 'test_cases' is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains parameters n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers. It calculates the total count of "beautiful pairs" for each test case, where a beautiful pair is defined as two numbers that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case, and empties the input list of test cases.
