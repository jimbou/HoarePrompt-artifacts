This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list of integers by splitting it into two lists, a and b, based on the condition that the last element of a is less than the next element of the list. The function then counts the number of times an element in a is greater than its previous element, and the number of times an element in b is greater than its previous element. Finally, it prints the total count of these occurrences for each test case.
