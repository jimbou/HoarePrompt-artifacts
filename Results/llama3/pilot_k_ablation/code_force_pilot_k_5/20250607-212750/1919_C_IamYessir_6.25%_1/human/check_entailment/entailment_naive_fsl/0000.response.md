Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program will split it into two subsequences [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4], and calculate the penalty as 2. However, the optimal split is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [], with a penalty of 0.

The issue with the program is that it always tries to append the current element to the subsequence that has the smaller last element. This greedy approach does not always lead to the optimal solution. A correct solution would involve using dynamic programming to consider all possible splits and calculate the minimum penalty.
