Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing either one or two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing either three or four integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list.***
