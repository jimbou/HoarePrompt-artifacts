Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list, `cp` is 0, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` of `lit` to it. The value of `b` remains either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list, depending on the condition in the initial state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
