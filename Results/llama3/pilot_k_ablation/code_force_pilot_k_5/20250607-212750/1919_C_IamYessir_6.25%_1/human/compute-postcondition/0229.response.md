Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least 6 elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 4. Otherwise, `s` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 4, otherwise it is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
