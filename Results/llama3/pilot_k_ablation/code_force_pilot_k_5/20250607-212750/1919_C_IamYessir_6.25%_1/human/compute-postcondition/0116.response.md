The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `b` has at least 4 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 5 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 5 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n` in `lit`.**
