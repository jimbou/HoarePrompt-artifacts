Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive). The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**
