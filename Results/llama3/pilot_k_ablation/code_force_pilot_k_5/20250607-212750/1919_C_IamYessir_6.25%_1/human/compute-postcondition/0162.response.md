To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `a` has at least 4 integers.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `a` has at least 4 integers, the loop can execute again.

The other variables, such as `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `_`, `b`, and `s`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3; otherwise, `s` is 2.**
