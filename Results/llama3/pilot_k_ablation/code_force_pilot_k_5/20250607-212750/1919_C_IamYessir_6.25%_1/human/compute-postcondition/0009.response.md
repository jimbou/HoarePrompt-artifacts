Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `cp` is 0. If the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and `b` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and `b` is a list containing the first three integers from `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the integer at index `i` of `lit`, which is the third integer in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `a` and `b` has been updated to reflect the new value of `b`.
