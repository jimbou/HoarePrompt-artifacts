Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the fourth element of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**
