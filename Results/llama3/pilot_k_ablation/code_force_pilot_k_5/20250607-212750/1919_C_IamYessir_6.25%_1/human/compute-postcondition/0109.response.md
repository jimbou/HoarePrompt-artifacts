Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer between 1 and `n-2` (inclusive). Otherwise, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive).***
