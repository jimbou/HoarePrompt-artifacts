Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 4. Otherwise, `s` is 3.***
