The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `a` has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have at least 5 elements.
State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` is 2.**
