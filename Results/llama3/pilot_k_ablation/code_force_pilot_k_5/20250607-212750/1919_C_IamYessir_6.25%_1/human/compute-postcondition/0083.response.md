The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 5, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing either one or two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing either three or four integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list.**
