Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `cp` is 0, `s` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `lit`, `stdin`, `_`, `i`, `cp`, `a`, and `b`. The relationship between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` also remains the same, with `a[i]` being greater than `a[i - 1]`.
