Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`, which is now the last element of `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `b` is still dependent on the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit`.
