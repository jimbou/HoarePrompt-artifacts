Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined, and the last element of `a` is larger than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit` is no longer valid because the last element of `a` is now the element at index `i` in `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `lit` remains unchanged, `a` now contains two integers, the first one is the first element of `lit` and the second one is the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is still empty, `cp` is still 0, `i` is still 1, `_` and `s` are still undefined. The condition that the last element of `a` is larger than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit` is no longer valid because the last element of `a` is now the element at index `i` in `lit`.
