The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and the input must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(b)-1`, `_` is 2, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing `len(b)` integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n+len(b)-2` in `lit`. `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive), representing the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, and the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element which is `s` is being printed**
