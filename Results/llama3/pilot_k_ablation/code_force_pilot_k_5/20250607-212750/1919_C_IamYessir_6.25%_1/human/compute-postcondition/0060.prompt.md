Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a)-1`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined. If all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, then `s` is `len(a)-1`. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a)-1`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least 2 elements. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one. Otherwise, the state of `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one or remains unchanged. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 1 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus two or remains unchanged plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 2 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus three or remains unchanged plus two. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one or remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 2`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 3` elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 3 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus four or remains unchanged plus three. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` + 1 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus two or remains unchanged plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 3`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 4` elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 4 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus five or remains unchanged plus four. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` + 2 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus three or remains unchanged plus two.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
