Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer of lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is not defined, _ is not defined, s is not defined, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` and `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the fourth element of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the fourth element of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. If `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `b` has an additional element which is the fifth element of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the fourth element of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. If `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `b` has an additional element which is the fifth element of `lit`. If `a[-1]` is not less than `lit[i]`, `a` has an additional element which is the fifth element of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
