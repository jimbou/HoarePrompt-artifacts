Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined.**

The code appends the integer at index `i` of `lit` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 4, the integer at index 4 of `lit` is appended to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
