Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)), `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 elements. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.***
