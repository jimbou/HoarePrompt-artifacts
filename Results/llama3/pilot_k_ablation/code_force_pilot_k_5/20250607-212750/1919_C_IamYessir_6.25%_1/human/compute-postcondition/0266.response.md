Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 3, and the list `lit` remains unchanged. The list `a` now contains the first two or three elements of `lit` (depending on the comparison of the first two elements) and the fourth element of `lit`. The list `b` remains unchanged, containing either the second and third elements of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, or an empty list (depending on the comparisons of the elements of `lit`). The values of `cp`, `i`, `_`, and `s` are still the same, and the `stdin` is still empty.
