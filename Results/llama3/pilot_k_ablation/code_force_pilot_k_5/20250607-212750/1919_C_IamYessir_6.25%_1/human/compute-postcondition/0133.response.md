To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 2.

The other variables in the state (`lit`, `cp`, `_`, `s`, `a`, and `b`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.**
