Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined. The last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`, which is the second element of `lit` since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
