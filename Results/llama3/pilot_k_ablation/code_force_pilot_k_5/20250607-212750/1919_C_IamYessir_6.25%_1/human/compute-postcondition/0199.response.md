Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`, which is the third element of `lit` since `i` is 2. The value of `b` remains the same as before, as it depends on the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, which has not changed. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
