Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing either three or four integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list if the last element of `a` is not less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` of `lit` to it. The length of `a` is now either three or four, depending on its initial length. The last element of `a` is now the element at index `i` of `lit`. The value of `b` is still dependent on the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
