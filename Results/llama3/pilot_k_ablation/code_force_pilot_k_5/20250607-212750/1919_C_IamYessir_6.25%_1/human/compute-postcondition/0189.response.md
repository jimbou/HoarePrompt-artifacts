The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least `n-1` elements, the lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`**
