Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 3 from the standard input. The value of `lit` is still a list of integers from the standard input. The value of `a` is still a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. The value of `b` is now a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. The value of `cp` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 3. The variable `_` is still not defined.
