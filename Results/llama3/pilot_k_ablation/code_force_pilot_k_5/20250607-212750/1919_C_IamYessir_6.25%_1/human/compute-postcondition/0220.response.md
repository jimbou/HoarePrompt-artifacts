Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least 3 elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined, `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 2; otherwise, `s` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
