Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.***
