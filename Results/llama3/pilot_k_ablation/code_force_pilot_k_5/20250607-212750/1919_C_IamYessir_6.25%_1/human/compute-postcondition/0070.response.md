Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. In both cases, `cp` is 0.***
