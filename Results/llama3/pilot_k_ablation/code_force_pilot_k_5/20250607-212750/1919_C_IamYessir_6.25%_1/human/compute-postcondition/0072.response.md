Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. In both cases, `cp` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` of `lit` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that determines the value of `b` is still based on the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit`.
