The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is at least 6, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 5, `cp` is 0. If the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then if the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first three integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`.
