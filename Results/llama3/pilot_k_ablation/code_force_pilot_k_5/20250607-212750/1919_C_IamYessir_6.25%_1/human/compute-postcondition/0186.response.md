Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least `n-1` elements, the lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus `n-2`. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus `n-3`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n-1`. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`, and `b` has at least `n-1` elements. The value of `s` depends on whether `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`. If it is, then `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus `n-2`. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus `n-3`.
