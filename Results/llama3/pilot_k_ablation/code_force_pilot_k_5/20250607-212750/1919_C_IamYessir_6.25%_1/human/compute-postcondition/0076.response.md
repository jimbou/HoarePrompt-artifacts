Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` of `lit` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The last element of `b` is now the element at index `i` of `lit`, which is the element at index 3 of `lit`.
