Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer greater than 3. The value of `lit` also remains the same, which is a list of integers. The value of `a` remains the same, which is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise it is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`. The value of `b` has changed, it now contains the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise it contains the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise it contains the fourth element of `lit`. The value of `cp` remains the same, which is 0. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 3. The value of `_` remains the same, which is not defined. The value of `s` remains the same, which is not defined. The value of `stdin` remains the same, which is empty.
