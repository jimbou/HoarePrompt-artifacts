Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the integer at index `i` of `lit` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, so `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`.
