The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `cp` is 0. If the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and `b` is an empty list.**
