To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `b`. If `b` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `1` (the starting value of the range). Also, `b` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `s` is `n - 2`.**
