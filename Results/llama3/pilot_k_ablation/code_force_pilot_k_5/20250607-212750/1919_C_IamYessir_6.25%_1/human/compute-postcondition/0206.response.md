Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 4, `lit` is still a list of integers, `a` still contains the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, `b` now contains the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` regardless of the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` remains 0, `i` remains 4, and `_` is still not defined.
