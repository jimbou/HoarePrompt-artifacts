Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 3`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 4` elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 4 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus five or remains unchanged plus four. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` + 2 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus three or remains unchanged plus two.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `s` are updated to reflect the increment. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 4 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus five or remains unchanged plus four. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` + 2 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus three or remains unchanged plus two.
