Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 3, `cp` is 0. If the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and `b` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and `b` is a list containing the first three integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `lit` is still a list of integers, `stdin` still contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is still 0, `i` is still 3, and `cp` is still 0. The list `b` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`. The conditions for `a` and `b` have been updated accordingly based on the values of `lit` and `i`.
