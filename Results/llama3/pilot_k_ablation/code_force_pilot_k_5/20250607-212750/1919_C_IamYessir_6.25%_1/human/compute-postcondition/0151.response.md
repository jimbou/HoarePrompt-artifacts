Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is undefined, `s` is 0, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers. The lists `a` and `b` are such that all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, and all elements in `b` are in non-decreasing order. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `s` is now defined and has a value of 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
