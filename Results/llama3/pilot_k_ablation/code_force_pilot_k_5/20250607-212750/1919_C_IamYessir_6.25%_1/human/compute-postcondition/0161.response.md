Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3; otherwise, `s` is 2.***
