State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
