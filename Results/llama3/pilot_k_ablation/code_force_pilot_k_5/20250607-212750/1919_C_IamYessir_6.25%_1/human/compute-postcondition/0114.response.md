Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 4 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n` in `lit`. If `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`, then `s` is increased by 2, else `s` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`. If `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`, then `s` is increased by 2, otherwise, it is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
