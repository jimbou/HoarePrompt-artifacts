Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing 3 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit`, the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and the third integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the third element of `lit` to it, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the values of `a` and `b` are still dependent on the comparison of the first two elements of `lit`.
