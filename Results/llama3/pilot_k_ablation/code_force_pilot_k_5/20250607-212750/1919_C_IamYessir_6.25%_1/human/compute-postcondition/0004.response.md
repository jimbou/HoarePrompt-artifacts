Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[-1]` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`, which is the second integer in the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `a[-1]` is less than the current value of `lit[i]` is still valid.
