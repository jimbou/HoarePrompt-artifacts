Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise it includes the first three elements of `lit`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
