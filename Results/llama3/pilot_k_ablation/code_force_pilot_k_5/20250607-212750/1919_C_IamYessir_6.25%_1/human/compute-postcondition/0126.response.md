Output State: **n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is undefined, _ is undefined, s is undefined.**

The code snippet provided modifies the initial state in the following ways:

*   The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. This overwrites the initial value of `n`.
*   The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `lit`. This overwrites the initial value of `lit`.
*   The third line initializes `a` with the first element of `lit` and initializes `b` as an empty list. This overwrites the initial values of `a` and `b`.
*   The fourth line assigns 0 to `cp`. This overwrites the initial value of `cp`.

The variables `i`, `_`, and `s` are not modified by the code snippet, but since their initial values were dependent on the lists `a` and `b`, which have been modified, their initial values are no longer valid. Therefore, they are considered undefined in the output state.
