To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know that it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. In both cases, `cp` is 0.**
