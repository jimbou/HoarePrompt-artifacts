The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `a` must still be a list containing at least 4 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 3 or 2. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1.**
