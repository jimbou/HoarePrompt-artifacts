To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and `input()`. Since `input()` is a function call, we can't adjust its state directly. However, we can adjust the state of `_` and the input that `input()` will receive.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `input()` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `input()` needs to contain at least one more test case.

State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus one input: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 1, `i` is `len(b)`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined, and `s` is either `len(b)-1` if all elements in `b` are in strictly increasing order, or the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element otherwise**
