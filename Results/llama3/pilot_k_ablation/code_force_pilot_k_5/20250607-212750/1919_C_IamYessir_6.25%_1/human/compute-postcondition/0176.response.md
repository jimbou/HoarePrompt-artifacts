The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `b` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `b` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least 4 elements, the lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 2. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 1.**
