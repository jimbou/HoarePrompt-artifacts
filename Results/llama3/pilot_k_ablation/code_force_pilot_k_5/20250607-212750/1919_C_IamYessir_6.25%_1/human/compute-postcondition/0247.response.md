Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least 5 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + 4` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + 3`. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + 2` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still valid, and the value of `s` is now dependent on the values of `a[i]`, `a[i-1]`, `b[i]`, and `b[i-1]`.
