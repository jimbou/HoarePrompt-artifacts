Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is undefined, _ is undefined, s is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit` and the second integer is the third element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is less than the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the third element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the second element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not equal to the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 3 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit`, the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and the third integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 3 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit`, the second integer is the third element of `lit`, and the third integer is the fourth element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is less than the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the third element of `lit` and the second integer is the fourth element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit` and the second integer is the fourth element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not equal to the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 3 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit`, the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and the third integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the fourth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit` and the second integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit` and the second integer is the third element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not equal to the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 3 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit`, the second integer is the second element of `lit`, and the third integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the third element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the third element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not equal to the third element of `lit` and the last element of `a` is not equal to the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing 4 integers, where the first integer is the first element of `lit`, the second integer is the second element of `lit`, the third integer is the third element of `lit`, and the fourth integer is the third element of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. `a` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions, and `b` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing 4 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit`, the second integer is the third element of `lit`, the third integer is the fourth element of `lit`, and the fourth integer is the fourth element of `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is now the fourth element of `lit`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. `a` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing 5 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit`, the second integer is the third element of `lit`, the third integer is the fourth element of `lit`, the fourth integer is the fourth element of `lit`, and the fifth integer is the fifth element of `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is now the fourth element of `lit` and `b` is a list containing 5 integers, where the first four integers are the same as before and the fifth integer is the fifth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the fourth element of `lit`, then the last element of `a` is the fifth element of `lit` and `b` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
