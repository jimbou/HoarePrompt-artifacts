According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer from stdin, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined**
