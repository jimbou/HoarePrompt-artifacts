Output State: **n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer obtained from the first input in `stdin`. The list `lit` contains a list of integers obtained from the second input in `stdin`, which is a space-separated list of integers. The list `a` contains only the first integer from `lit`, while the list `b` remains empty. The variable `cp` is assigned the value 0. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that it now contains at least one test case minus the two inputs that have been processed. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
