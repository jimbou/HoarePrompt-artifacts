Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers as previously defined**.

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions defining the lists `a` and `b` are still valid, and their contents depend on the values of `lit` and `i`.
