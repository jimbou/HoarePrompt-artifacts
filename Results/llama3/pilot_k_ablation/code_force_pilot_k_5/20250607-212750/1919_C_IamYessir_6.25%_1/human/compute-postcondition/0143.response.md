Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list containing 4 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit`, the second integer is the third element of `lit`, the third integer is the fourth element of `lit`, and the fourth integer is the fourth element of `lit`.**

The code appends the fourth element of `lit` to `b`. Since `i` is 4, `lit[i]` refers to the fourth element of `lit`. The value of `b` is updated by appending this element. The other variables remain unchanged.
