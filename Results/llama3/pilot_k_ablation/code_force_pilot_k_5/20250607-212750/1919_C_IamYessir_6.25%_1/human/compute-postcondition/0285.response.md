State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` where the last element of `a` is less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` where the last element of `a` is not less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined, `stdin` is empty, and `a` must have at least 4 elements. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2, otherwise `s` is 1.**
