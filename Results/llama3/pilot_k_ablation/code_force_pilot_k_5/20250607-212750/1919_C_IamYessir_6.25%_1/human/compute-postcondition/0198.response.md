Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list but now `b` is updated to contain the integer at index `i` of `lit` which is `lit[2]`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `b` is updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`, which is `lit[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
