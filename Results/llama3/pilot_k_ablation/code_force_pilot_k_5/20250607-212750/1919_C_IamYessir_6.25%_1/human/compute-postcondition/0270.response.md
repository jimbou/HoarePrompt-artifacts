Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 4. The value of `lit` remains a list of integers. The value of `a` is updated to include the fourth element of `lit`. The value of `b` depends on the values of the elements in `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`. If the first element of `lit` is not less than the second element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`. The values of `cp`, `i`, `_`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
