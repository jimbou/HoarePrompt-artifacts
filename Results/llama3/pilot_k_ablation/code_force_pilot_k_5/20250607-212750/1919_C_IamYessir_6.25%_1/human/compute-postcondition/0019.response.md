Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0. If the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then if the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first three integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`.***
