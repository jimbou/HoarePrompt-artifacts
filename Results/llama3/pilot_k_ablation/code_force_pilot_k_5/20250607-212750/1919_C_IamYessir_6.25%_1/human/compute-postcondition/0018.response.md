Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0. If the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first three integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `n` is still at least 5, and `lit` is still a list of integers. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The values of `_` and `cp` remain 0, and `i` is still 4. The list `a` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `lit`. The conditions for the values of `a` and `b` are still dependent on the comparison of the first two integers of `lit` and the last integer of `a` with the integer at index `i` of `lit`.
