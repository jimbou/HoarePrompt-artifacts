The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `len(a) + 2` and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least `len(a) + 3` elements.
State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 2`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 3` elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 2 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus three or remains unchanged plus two. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one or remains unchanged.**
