State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 5, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 6 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n+1` in `lit`. If the element at index `i` in `b` is greater than the element at index `i-1` in `b`, then `s` is increased by 1.**
