Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined, `s` is 3 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 2.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` was 2 and is now 3. Otherwise, `s` was 1 and is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
