Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` was either 2 or 1, and now it is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `s` was 0, and now it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
