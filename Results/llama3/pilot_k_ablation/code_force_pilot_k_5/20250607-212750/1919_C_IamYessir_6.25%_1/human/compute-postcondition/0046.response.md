Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a)-1`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least 2 elements, `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, and it can now be either the length of list `a` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
