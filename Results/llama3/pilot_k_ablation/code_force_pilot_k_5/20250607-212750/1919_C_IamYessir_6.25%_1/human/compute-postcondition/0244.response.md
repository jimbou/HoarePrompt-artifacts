Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least 5 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + 3` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + 2`. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `a`, `b`, and `s` are still the same, but the value of `s` has been increased by 1.
