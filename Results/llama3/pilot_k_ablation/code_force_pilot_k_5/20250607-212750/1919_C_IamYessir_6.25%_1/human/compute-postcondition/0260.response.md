To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `_`, `s`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` and `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty**
