To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `a`, and the range `1` to `len(a)`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `len(a)` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a)`. If `len(a)` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.
2. Since `i` is used as the loop variable, its initial value should be 1, which is the starting point of the range.
3. The state of `a` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least 2 elements, so that the loop can execute.

Considering these points, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit**
