Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is not defined. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `s` is `n - 2`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `i` and `s`. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, which means the loop has executed `n` times. The value of `s` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, depending on whether the last element of `a` is greater than or less than the element at index `i` of `lit`.
