Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. `a` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions, and `b` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing 4 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit`, the second integer is the third element of `lit`, the third integer is the fourth element of `lit`, and the fourth integer is the fourth element of `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is now the fourth element of `lit`.***
