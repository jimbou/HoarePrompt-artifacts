To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1. Additionally, since `i` is undefined before the loop, we need to define it as the starting value of the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing one integer, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty**
