Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The last element of `a` is the second element of `lit`**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains the first two integers from the list `lit`, as the second integer from `lit` has been appended to `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
