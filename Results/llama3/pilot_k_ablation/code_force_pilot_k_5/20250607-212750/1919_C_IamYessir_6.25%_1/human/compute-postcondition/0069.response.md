Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element at index `i` in `lit`, which is now the last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
