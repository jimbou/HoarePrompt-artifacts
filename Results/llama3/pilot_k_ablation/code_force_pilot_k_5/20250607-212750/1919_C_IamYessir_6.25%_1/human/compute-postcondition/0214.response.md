Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is not defined, `s` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `s` is introduced with a value of 0. The values of `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `_` are the same as in the initial state.
