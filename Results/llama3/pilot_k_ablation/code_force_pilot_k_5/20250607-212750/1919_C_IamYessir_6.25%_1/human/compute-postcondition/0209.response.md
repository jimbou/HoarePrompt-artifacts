The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` contains three elements, otherwise `b` contains two elements.**
