Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`, `s` is an integer between 1 and `n-2` (inclusive), and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and `n-2` (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between the elements of `b` is still valid, with `b[i]` being greater than `b[i - 1]`.
