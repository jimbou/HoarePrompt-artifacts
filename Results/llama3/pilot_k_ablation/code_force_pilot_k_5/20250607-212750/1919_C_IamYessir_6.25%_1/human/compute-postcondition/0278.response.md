The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If a has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first n integers of lit if the first element of lit is less than the second element of lit, otherwise a is a list containing the first n integers of lit where the last element of a is less than the next element of lit if it exists, b is a list containing the remaining elements of lit if the first element of lit is less than the second element of lit, otherwise b is a list containing the remaining elements of lit where the last element of a is not less than the next element of lit if it exists, cp is 0, i is n-1, _ is not defined, s is 0, stdin is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to a has at least 2 elements and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` where the last element of `a` is less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` where the last element of `a` is not less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined, `s` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `a` must have at least 2 elements**
