The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers in non-decreasing order. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be a list containing at least 3 integers in non-decreasing order.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers in non-decreasing order, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
