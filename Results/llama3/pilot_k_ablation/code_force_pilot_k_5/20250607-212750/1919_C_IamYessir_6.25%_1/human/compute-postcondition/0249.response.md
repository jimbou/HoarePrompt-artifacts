Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `_` is not defined. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + len(b) - 2` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 3`. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + len(b) - 3` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 4` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 5`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `lit` remains unchanged, which is a list of integers.
- The value of `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements.
- The value of `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least `len(b)` elements.
- The value of `cp` remains unchanged, which is 0.
- The value of `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- The value of `_` remains undefined.
- The value of `s` depends on the values of `b[i]`, `b[i - 1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + len(b) - 2` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 3`. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + len(b) - 3` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 4` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 5`.
