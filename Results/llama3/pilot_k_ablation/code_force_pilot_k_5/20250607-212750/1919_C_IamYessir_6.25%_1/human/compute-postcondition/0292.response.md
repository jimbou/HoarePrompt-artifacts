Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing at least 5 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 5 or 4. Otherwise, `s` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 5 or 4. Otherwise, `s` is 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
