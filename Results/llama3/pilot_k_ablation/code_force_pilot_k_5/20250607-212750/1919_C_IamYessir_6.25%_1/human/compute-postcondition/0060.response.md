Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined. If all elements in `b` are in strictly increasing order, then `s` is `len(b)-1`. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of list `b`, and the value of `s` will be the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element. If all elements in `b` are in strictly increasing order, then `s` will be equal to `len(b)-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
