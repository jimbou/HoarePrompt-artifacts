Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [lit[0]], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[-1] < lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        else:
            a.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined, and `s` is either `len(b)-1` if all elements in `b` are in strictly increasing order, or the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element otherwise, and this value of `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(b)-1`, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing `len(b)` integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n+len(b)-2` in `lit`. `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive), representing the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, and the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element which is `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least `n-1` elements, the lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`, and the value of `s` is being printed, where `s` is either the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus `n-2` or the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus `n-3`, depending on whether `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `_` is not defined. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + len(b) - 2` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 3`. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n + len(b) - 3` if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 4` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n + len(b) - 5`, and the value of `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` where the last element of `a` is less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` where the last element of `a` is not less than the next element of `lit` if it exists and is empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `_` is not defined, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(b)), `stdin` is empty, and the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(b)) which is `s` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
