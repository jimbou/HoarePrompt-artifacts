Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 5, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 5 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 5 or 4. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2 or 3. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1 or 2.***
