To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. Since `n` is at least 4, it must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. `a` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions, and `b` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing 4 integers, where the first integer is the second element of `lit`, the second integer is the third element of `lit`, the third integer is the fourth element of `lit`, and the fourth integer is the fourth element of `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is now the fourth element of `lit`.**
