Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 2 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus three or remains unchanged plus two. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one or remains unchanged.***
