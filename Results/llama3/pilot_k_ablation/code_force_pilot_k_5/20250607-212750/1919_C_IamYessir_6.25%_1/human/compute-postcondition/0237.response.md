The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of list `b`. If `i` is less than the length of list `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and list `b` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and list `b` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` and must have at least 3 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n - 1`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is `n - 1` if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is `n - 2`.**
