Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is either `len(a)` + 1 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus two or remains unchanged plus one.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` can be either `len(a)` + 1, the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus two, or remains unchanged plus one, depending on its initial value.
