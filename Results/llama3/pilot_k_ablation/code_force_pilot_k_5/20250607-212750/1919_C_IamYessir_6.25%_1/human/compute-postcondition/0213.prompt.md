Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer from stdin, lit is a list of integers from stdin, a is a list containing the first integer of lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is not defined, _ is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is updated to contain the integer at index `i` of `lit` which is `lit[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `_` is not defined. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` contains three elements, otherwise `b` contains two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` contains three elements, otherwise `b` contains two elements. `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
