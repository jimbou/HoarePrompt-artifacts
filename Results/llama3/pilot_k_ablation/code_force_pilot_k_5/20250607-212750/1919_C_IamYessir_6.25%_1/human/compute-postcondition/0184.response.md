Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least 6 elements, the lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 5. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 4.**
