Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 5, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing either two or three integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing either three or four integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing two integers which are the element at index `i` of `lit` or a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 5, `lit` is still a list of integers, `i` is still 5, `_` is still 1, `s` is still undefined, `stdin` is still empty, and `cp` is still 0. The list `b` has been appended with the element at index `i` of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` now contains either two or three integers, with the last element being the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` still contains either three or four integers, with the last element being the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing two integers which are the element at index `i` of `lit` or a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`.
