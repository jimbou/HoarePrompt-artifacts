To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `b` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `_`, `a`, and `s`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least 3 elements. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)).**
