Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing at least 5 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined, `stdin` is empty, and `s` is either 4 or 3 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now either 4 or 3, otherwise, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
