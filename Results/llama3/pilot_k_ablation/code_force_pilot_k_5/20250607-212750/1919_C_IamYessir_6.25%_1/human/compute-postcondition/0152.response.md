The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, and `n` is an integer, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute. So, `a` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is now 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers in non-decreasing order, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`.**
