To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive)**
