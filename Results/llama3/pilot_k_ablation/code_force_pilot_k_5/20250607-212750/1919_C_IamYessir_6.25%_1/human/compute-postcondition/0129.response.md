Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing 1 integer, which is the element at index `i` in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. The current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to contain the element at index `i` in `lit`, which is the second element of `lit` since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between the last elements of `a` and `b` is also updated to reflect the new value of `b`.
