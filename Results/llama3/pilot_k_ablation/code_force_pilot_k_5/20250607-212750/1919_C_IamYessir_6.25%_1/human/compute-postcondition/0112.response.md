Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 3 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `s` is increased by 1.***
