Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate `n` times, where `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1. The list `lit` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The list `a` will contain the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` will contain the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`. The list `b` will contain the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `b` will contain the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. The variable `cp` remains 0, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes. The variable `_` remains undefined.
