The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 1, it appends the second element of `lit` to `b`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. The last element of `a` is less than the second element of `lit`.**
