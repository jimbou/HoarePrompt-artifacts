The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` where the last element of `a` is less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` where the last element of `a` is not less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined, `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 0, `stdin` is empty, and `a` must have at least 3 elements.**
