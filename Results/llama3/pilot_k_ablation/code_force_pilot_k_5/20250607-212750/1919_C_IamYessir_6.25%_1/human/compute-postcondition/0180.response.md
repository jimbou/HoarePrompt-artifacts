Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order that must have at least 5 elements, the lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 4. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `s` remain the same, but the value of `s` has increased by 1.
