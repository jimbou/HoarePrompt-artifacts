Output State: **n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer of lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is not defined, _ is not defined, s is not defined, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer read from stdin, and `lit` is a list of integers also read from stdin. The list `a` contains only the first integer of `lit`, and the list `b` is empty. The variable `cp` is initialized to 0. The variables `i`, `_`, and `s` are not defined because they were not assigned any values in the given code snippet. Stdin is empty because all inputs have been read and processed.
