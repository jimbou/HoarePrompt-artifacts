The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, the third element of `lit`, and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is not less than the fourth element of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first two integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first three integers of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is not less than the third element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is an empty list. If `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `b` has an additional element which is the fifth element of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**
