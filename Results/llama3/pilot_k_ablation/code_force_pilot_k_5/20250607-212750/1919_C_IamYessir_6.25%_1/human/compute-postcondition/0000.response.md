To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the `input()` function.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0. Since `input()` is a function that reads from `stdin`, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure it contains at least one test case.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one test case, `_` is 0**
