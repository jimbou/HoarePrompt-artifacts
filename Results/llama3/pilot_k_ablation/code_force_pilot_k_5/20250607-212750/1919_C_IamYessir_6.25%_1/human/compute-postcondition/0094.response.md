Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`, `s` is either 2 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` was initially 1 and is now 2. Otherwise, `s` remains 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
