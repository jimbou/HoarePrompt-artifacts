The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, it appends the second element of `lit` to `a`. The last element of `a` is now the second element of `lit`, which is less than or equal to the last element of `a` before the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the second integer of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is not defined. The last element of `a` is less than or equal to the last element of `a` before the append operation.**
