Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is undefined, `a` is a list containing at least 5 integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 5; otherwise, `s` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 5; otherwise, `s` is now 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
