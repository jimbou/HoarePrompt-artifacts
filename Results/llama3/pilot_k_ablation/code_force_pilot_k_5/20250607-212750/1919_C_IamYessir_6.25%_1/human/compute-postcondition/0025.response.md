Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `cp` is 0. If the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then if the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the first three integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the first integer of `lit` is not less than the second integer of `lit` and the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` has an additional element which is the integer at index `i` of `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` of `lit`, then `a` now also contains the integer at index `i` of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate `n-1` times. After each iteration, if the last integer of `a` is less than the current integer in `lit`, `b` will be appended with the current integer. If the last integer of `a` is not less than the current integer in `lit`, `a` will be appended with the current integer. The loop will continue until it has iterated `n-1` times. At the end of the loop, `a` will contain the first two integers from `lit` and the last integer from `lit`, and `b` will contain the remaining integers from `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is less than the last integer of `lit`, `b` will have an additional element which is the last integer of `lit`. If the last integer of `a` is not less than the last integer of `lit`, then `a` will also contain the last integer of `lit`.
