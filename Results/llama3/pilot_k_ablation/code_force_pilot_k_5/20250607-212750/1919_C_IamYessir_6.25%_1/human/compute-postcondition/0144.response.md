Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions, and `b` is a list containing 1 to 3 integers depending on the previous conditions. The last element of `a` is now the fourth element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the fourth element of `lit` to it. The previous conditions that determined the length and elements of `a` and `b` are still valid, but now the last element of `a` is the fourth element of `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
