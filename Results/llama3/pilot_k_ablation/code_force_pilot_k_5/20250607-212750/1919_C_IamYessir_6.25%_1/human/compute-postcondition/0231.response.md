Output State: `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is not defined, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range from 1 to `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will contain the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `a` will contain the first integer of `lit` and the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit` and has at least `n` elements. The variable `s` will be the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range from 1 to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
