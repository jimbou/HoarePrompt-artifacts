Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined. `a` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers. The lists `a` and `b` are such that all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, and all elements in `b` are in non-decreasing order. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the lists `a` and `b` are split from the list `lit` in a way that all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, and all elements in `b` are in non-decreasing order. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. The variable `i` is now `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The other variables `cp`, `_`, and `s` remain unchanged.
