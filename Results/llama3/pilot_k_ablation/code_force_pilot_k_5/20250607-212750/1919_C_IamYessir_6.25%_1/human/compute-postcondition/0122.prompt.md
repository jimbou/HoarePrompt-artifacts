Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive), representing the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer between 1 and `n-2` (inclusive). Otherwise, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-2` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 3 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `s` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 4 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n` in `lit`. If `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`, then `s` is increased by 2. If `b[3]` is not greater than `b[2]` but `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 5 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n` in `lit`. If the element at index `i` in `b` is greater than the element at index `i-1` in `b`, then `s` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 5, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n-1` integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing at least 6 integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n+1` in `lit`. If the element at index `i` in `b` is greater than the element at index `i-1` in `b`, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
