Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[-1]` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`.**
