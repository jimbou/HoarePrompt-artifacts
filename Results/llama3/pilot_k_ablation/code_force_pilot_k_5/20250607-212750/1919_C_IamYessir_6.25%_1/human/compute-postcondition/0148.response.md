Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is undefined, `s` is undefined, `a` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions and the last element of `a` is the fifth element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing 1 to 4 integers depending on the previous conditions.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the fifth element of `lit` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that determine the length and contents of `a` and `b` are still valid, but the last element of `a` is now the fifth element of `lit`.
