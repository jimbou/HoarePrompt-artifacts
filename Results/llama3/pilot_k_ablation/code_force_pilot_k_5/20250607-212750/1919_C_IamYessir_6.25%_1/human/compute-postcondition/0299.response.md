State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` where the last element of `a` is less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` where the last element of `a` is not less than the next element of `lit` if it exists and has at least 3 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is not defined, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)) plus one if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, len(a)), `stdin` is empty**
