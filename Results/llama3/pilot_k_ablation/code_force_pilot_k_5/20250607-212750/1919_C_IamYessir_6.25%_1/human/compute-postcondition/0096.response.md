To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. The length of `a` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
