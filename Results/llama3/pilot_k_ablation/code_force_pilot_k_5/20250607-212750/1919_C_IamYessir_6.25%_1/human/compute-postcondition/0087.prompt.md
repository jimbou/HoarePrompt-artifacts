Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing one integer, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is undefined, _ is 1, s is undefined, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. In both cases, `cp` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing three integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 4, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing either one or two integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing either three or four integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 5, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` is a list containing either two or three integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing either three, four or five integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is either a list containing one or two integers which are the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
