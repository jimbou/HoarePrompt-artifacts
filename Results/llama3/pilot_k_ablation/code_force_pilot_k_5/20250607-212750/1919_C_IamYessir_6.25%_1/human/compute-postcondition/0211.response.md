Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 5, `lit` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integers at indices 3 and `i` of `lit`, and the integer at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit`, the integer at index `i` of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the first integer of `lit` and the integer at index `i` of `lit`. `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `_` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the integer at index `i` of `lit` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition for `b` to have three elements or two elements still depends on the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, which has not been changed by the code.
