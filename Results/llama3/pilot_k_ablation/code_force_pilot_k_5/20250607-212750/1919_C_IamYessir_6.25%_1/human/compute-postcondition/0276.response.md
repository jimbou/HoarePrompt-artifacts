Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers of `lit` where the last element of `a` is less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is less than the second element of `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit` where the last element of `a` is not less than the next element of `lit` if it exists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is not defined, `s` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` will contain the longest increasing subsequence of `lit` starting from the first element, and `b` will contain the remaining elements of `lit`. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
