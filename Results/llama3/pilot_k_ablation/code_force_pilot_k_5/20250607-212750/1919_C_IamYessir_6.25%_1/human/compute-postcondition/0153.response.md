Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, `s` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers in non-decreasing order, and `b` is a list containing 1 to `n-1` integers in non-decreasing order. The lists `a` and `b` together contain all elements of `lit` in the same order as they appear in `lit`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**
