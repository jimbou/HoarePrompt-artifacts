According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1. The other variables in the state before the loop starts are not relevant to the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**
