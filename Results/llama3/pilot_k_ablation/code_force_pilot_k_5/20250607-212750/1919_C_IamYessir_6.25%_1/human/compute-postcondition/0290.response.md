Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing at least 5 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `_` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 4 or 3. Otherwise, `s` is 2.***
