Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing one integer, `b` is a list containing one integer which is the element at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. The last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to contain one integer, which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `lit` is still valid.
