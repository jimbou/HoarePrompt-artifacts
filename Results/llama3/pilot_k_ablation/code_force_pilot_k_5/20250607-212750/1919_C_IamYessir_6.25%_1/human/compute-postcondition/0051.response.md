To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(a)`, and `b` must have at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `len(a) + 1`. Since `b` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is now `len(a) + 1`, `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`n`, `lit`, `stdin`, `_`, `cp`, `a`, and `s`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least `n`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers as previously defined and must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements, `s` is either `len(a)` or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one or remains unchanged. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` + 1 or the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus two or remains unchanged plus one.**
