Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, the last element of `a` is the element at index `n-2` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing either `n-1` or fewer integers, the last element of `b` is the element at index `n-1` in `lit`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
