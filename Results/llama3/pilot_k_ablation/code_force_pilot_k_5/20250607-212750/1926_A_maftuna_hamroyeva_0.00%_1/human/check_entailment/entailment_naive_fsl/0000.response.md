Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has an equal number of 'A's and 'B's. In this case, the program does not print anything because it only checks if 'A' is more frequent than 'B' or vice versa, but it does not handle the case when they are equal. 

For example, if the input string is "AABBB", the program will not print anything, whereas it should print either 'A' or 'B' according to the problem description. 

The program should be modified to handle this case, for example, by printing 'A' when the frequency of 'A' and 'B' is equal. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = str(input())
        l = a.count('A')
        h = a.count('B')
        if l >= h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```
