Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for i in range(t):
        a = str(input())
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')





# Execution Summary:
The function reads a series of strings from standard input, each consisting of letters A and B, and prints 'A' if the count of A's is greater than the count of B's, 'B' if the count of B's is greater than the count of A's, or takes no additional action if the counts are equal. The function processes a specified number of strings, ranging from 1 to 32, and consumes all input from standard input.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
