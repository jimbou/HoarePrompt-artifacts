To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the third character in the string `a`, and `a` has at least 3 characters.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 4 characters, and `j` must be the fourth character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 4 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 20 inclusive, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, j is the fourth character in the string `a`. If j is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 18 inclusive. If j is 'B', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 18 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.**
