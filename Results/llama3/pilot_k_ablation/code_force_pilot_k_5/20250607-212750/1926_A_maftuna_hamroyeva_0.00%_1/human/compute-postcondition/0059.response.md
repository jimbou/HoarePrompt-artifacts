Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same constraints on `t`, `i`, and stdin as the initial state. The string `a` will still be of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The variables `l` and `h` will be integers between 0 and 10 inclusive, depending on the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string `a`.
