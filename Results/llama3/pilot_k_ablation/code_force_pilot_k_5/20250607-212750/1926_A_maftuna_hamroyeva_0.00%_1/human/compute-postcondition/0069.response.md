The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is higher than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `l` is less than `h`, 'B' is printed.**
