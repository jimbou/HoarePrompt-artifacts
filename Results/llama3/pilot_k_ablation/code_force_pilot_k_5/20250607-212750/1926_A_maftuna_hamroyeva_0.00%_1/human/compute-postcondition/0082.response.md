Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, `l` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the third character of the string `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and 13 inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The value of `j` is still the third character of the string `a`.
