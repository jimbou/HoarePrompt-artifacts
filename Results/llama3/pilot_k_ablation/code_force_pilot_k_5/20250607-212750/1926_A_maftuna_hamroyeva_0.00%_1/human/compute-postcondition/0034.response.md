Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, and stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, no additional action is taken.***
