Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fourth character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so its range has been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
