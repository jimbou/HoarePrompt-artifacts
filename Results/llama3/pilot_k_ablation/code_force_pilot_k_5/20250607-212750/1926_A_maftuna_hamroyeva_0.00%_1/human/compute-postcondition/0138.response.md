Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' has been printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' has been printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action has been taken.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, which is the input from stdin. The stdin now contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, since one string has been consumed by the input operation. The other variables remain unchanged.
