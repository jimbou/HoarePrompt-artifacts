Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character of `a`, `i` is 0, `h` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `j` is 'A' or either 2, 3, or 4 if `j` is 'B', `l` is either 2, 1, 3, or 4 if `j` is 'A' or either 1, 2, or 0 if `j` is 'B', and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is 'A', then `h` can be either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `j` is 'B', then `h` can be either 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain the same.
