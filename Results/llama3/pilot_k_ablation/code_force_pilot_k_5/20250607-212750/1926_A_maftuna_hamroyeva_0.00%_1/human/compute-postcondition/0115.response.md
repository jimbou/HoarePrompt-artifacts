To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second character in the string `a`, and `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 characters. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `a` to be a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters.

Since `j` is the second character in the string `a`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be the third character in the string `a`.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `l`, `h`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the third character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 15 inclusive and `h` is between 2 and 16 inclusive.**
