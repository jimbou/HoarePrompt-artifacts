Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 1 character, `l` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 11 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the first character of the string `a` and `j` is not 'A'**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 1 and 11 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The first character of the string `a` is still not 'A'.
