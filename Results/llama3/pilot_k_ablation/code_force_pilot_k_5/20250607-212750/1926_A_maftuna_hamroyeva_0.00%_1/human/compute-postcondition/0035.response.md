The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is an empty string, and stdin contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, no additional action is taken.**
