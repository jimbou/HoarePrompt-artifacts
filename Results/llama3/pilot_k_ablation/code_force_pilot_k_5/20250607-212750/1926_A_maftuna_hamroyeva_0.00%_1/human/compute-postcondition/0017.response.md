To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the third character of `a`, and `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be the next character in `a`. Since `a` has a length of 4, the next character would be the fourth character.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fourth character of `a`, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is either 2, 1, or 3 and `h` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is 'B', then `l` is either 1 or 0 and `h` is either 1 or 2.**
