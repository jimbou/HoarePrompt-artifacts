Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fourth character of `a`, `i` is 0, if `j` is 'A', then `l` is either 3, 2, or 4 and `h` is either 0 or 1, if `j` is 'B', then `l` is either 2 or 1 and `h` is either 1 or 2, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is 'A', then `l` can be 3, 2, or 4, and if `j` is 'B', then `l` can be 2 or 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
