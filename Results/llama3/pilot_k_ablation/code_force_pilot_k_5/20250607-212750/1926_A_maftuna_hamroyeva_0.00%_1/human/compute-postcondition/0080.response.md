Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 12 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 12 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 10 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 11 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 12 inclusive.***
