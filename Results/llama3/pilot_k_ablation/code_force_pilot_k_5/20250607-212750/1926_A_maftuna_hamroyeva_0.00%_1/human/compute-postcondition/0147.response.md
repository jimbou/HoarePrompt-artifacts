Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is an integer between 0 and 18 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 19 inclusive, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, j is the second character in the string `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and 19 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
