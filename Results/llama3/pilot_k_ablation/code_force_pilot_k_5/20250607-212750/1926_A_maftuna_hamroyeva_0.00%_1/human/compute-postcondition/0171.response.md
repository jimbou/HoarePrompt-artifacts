Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, `a` is an empty string, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 5t inclusive, stdin is empty. If `l` is greater than `h`, then 'A' has been printed `t` times. If `l` is less than `h`, then 'B' has been printed `t` times. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action has been taken.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, the variable `i` has reached the value of `t-1`, the string `a` is empty, and the variables `l` and `h` have accumulated counts of 'A's and 'B's respectively from all the input strings. The standard input `stdin` is now empty as all input strings have been processed. Depending on the final values of `l` and `h`, either 'A' or 'B' has been printed a number of times equal to the value of `t`, or no additional action has been taken if `l` equals `h`.
