To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be between 1 and 32 inclusive, we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it will be incremented to 1 in the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**
