Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 4 characters, `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`, `l` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1 if `j` is not 'A' and remains unchanged if `j` is 'A', and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, which is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 1. The string `a` remains the same, with a length of 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 4 characters. The value of `j` remains the same, which is the fourth character in the string `a`. The value of `l` is increased by 1. The value of `h` is increased by 1 if `j` is not 'A' and remains unchanged if `j` is 'A'. The stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
