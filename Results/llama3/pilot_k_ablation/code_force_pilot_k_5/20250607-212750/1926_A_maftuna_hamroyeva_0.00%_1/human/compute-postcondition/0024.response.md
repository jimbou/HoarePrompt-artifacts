Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character of `a`, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is either 3, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, or 1 and `h` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `j` is 'B', then `h` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 and `l` is either 2, 1, 3, or 4.**
