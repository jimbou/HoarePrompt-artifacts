Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, no additional action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `a`, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character in the string `a`, `l` and `h` are integers, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 7 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive if `j` is 'A' and between 2 and 7 inclusive if `j` is not 'A'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the third character in the string `a`, and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is increased by 1 and `h` remains unchanged. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` is increased by 1 and `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 4 characters, `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`, `l` is increased by 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `h` is increased by 1 if `j` is not 'A', otherwise `h` remains unchanged, and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 5 characters, `j` is the fifth character in the string `a`, `l` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1 if `j` is not 'A', otherwise `h` remains unchanged, and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
