Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, no additional action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, which is the input from stdin. The number of strings in stdin has decreased by 1, from t-2 to t-3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditional printing of 'A' or 'B' based on the values of `l` and `h` is still applicable.
