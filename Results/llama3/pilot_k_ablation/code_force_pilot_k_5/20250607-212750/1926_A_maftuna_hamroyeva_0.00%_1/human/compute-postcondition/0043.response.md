To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the first character in the string `a`, and `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 1 character.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 characters. Since `j` is the first character in the string `a`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be the second character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character in the string `a`, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive.**
