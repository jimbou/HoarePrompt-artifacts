The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is an empty string, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-6 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' has been printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' has been printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action has been taken.**
