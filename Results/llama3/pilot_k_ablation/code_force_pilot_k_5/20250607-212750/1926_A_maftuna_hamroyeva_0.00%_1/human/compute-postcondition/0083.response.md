Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, `l` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive, `j` is the third character of the string `a`, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `h` has been incremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and 13 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input in stdin remains unchanged.
