Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, l is 0, h is 0, stdin contains t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = str(input())
    for j in a:
        if j in 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    elif l < h:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, and stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, no additional action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is higher than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `l` is less than `h`, 'B' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 15 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is an empty string, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' has been printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' has been printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action has been taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 5 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 25 inclusive, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' has been printed twice. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' has been printed twice. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action has been taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
