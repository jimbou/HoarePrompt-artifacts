Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `a`, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive.***
