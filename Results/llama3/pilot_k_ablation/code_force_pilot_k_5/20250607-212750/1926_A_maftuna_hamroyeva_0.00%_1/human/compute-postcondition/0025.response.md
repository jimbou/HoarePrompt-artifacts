Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, and stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, the variable `l` will have a value between 0 and 5 (inclusive) depending on the number of 'A's in the string `a`, the variable `h` will have a value between 0 and 5 (inclusive) depending on the number of 'B's in the string `a`, the variable `i` remains 0, the string `a` is empty, and the stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
