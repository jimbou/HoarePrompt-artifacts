Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `l` is an integer between 1 and 16 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, the first character in the string `a` is `j` and the current value of `j` is 'A'.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and 16 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
