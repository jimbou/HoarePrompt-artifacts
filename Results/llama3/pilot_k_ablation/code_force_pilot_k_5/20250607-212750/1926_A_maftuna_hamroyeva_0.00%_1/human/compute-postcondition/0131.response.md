Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is an empty string, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. `l` is less than or equal to `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action is taken.***
