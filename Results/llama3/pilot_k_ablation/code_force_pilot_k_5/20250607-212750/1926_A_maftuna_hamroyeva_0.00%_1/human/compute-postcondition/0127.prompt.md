Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 15 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 16 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the first character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 16 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 15 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 16 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 15 inclusive and `h` is between 2 and 16 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the third character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 3 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 16 inclusive and `h` is between 2 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 15 inclusive and `h` is between 3 and 17 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 4 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 4 and 18 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 2 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 3 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 16 inclusive and `h` is between 3 and 17 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 5 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 4 and 18 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 2 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 4 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 16 inclusive and `h` is between 3 and 17 inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
