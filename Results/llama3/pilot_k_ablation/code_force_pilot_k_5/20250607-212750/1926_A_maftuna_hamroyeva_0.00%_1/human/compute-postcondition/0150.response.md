Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 20 inclusive, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, j is the third character in the string `a`. If j is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 18 inclusive. Otherwise, `l` is an integer between 1 and 19 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 19 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so its range has shifted accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `j` still apply.
