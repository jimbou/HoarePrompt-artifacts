Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 3 and 15 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. The value of `h` now depends on the value of `j`, which is the fifth character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` is an integer between 3 and 15 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
