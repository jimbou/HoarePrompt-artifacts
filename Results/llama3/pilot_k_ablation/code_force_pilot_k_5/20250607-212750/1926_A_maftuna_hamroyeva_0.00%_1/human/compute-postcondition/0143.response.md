Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, `h` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the first character in the string `a` and is not 'A', If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' has been printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' has been printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action has been taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `h` has been increased by 1, while the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The relationship between `l` and `h` and the corresponding actions taken remain the same, but the comparison between `l` and `h` may have changed due to the increment of `h`.
