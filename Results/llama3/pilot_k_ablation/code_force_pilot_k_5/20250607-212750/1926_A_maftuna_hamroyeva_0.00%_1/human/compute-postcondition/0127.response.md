Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is an empty string, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, then the letter 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, then the letter 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, then no additional action is taken.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `a` is empty, and the values of `l` and `h` are between 0 and 17 inclusive. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop has iterated over all characters in the string `a`, incrementing `l` for each 'A' and `h` for each 'B'. The final values of `l` and `h` depend on the initial values and the contents of the string `a`.
