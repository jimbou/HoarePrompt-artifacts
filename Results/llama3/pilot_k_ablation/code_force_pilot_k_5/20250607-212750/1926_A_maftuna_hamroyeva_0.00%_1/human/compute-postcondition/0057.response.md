Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 5 characters, `j` is the fifth character in the string `a`, `l` is increased by 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `h` is increased by 1 if `j` is not 'A', otherwise `h` remains unchanged and now h is increased by 1, and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been increased by 1, regardless of the value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
