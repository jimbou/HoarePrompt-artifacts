Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 5 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 17 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 5 and 18 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 3 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 2 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 4 and 17 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 16 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 16 inclusive and `h` is between 3 and 17 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The ranges of `l` and `h` have been updated accordingly based on the value of `j`.
