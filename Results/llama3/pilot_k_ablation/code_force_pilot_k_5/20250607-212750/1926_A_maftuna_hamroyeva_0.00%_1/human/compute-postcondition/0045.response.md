Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character in the string `a`, `h` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive if `j` is 'A' and between 2 and 7 inclusive if `j` is not 'A', `l` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive if `j` is 'A' and between 0 and 5 inclusive if `j` is not 'A', and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is 'A', then `h` is now an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, and if `j` is not 'A', then `h` is now an integer between 2 and 7 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain the same.
