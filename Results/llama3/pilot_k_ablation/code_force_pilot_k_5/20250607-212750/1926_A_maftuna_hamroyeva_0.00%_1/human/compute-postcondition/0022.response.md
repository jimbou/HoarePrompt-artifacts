Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character of `a`, `i` is 0, `l` is either 3, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, or 1, and `h` is either 0, 1, or 2 if `j` is 'A', or 1, 2, or 3 if `j` is 'B', and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it can take on the values 3, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, or 1, depending on its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
