Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 5 characters, `l` and `h` are integers, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, j is the fifth character in the string `a`. If j is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive. If j is 'B', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 18 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 4 and 22 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, between 5 and 32. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 4. The string `a` remains the same, with a length of 5 and consisting of letters A and B. The value of `l` remains the same, but the range of `h` has changed. If the fifth character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is between 2 and 20, and `h` is now between 2 and 20. If the fifth character of the string `a` is 'B', then `l` is between 0 and 18, and `h` is now between 4 and 22. The stdin still contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
