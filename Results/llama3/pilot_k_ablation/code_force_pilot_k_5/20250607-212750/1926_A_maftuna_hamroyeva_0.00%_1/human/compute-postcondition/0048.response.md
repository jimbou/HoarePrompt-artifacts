Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the third character in the string `a`, `l` is increased by 1, `h` is an integer, and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `l` is increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still has a length of 5 and consists of letters A and B, with at least 2 characters. The variable `j` is still the third character in the string `a`. The integer `t` is still between 2 and 32 inclusive, and `i` is still 1. The integer `h` is still an integer. The stdin still contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
