Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is higher than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `l` is less than `h`, 'B' is printed.***
