Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the third character in the string `a`, and stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is increased by 1 and `h` remains unchanged. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` is increased by 1 and `l` remains unchanged.***
