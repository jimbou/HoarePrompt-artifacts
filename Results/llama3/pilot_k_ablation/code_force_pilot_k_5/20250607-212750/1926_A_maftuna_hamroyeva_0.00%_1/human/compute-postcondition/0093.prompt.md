Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `l` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, and stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is higher than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `l` is less than `h`, 'B' is printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 1 character, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 11 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the first character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 11 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 10 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 10 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 2 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 12 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 12 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 10 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 11 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 12 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the third character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fourth character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 3 and 15 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 3 and 15 inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
