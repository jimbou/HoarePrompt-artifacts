Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the third character of `a`, `i` is 0, `h` is either 2 or 1 if `j` is 'A' or 2 if `j` is 'B', and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 or 1. If `j` is 'B', then `l` is 1 or 0.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be either 2 or 1 if `j` is 'A' or 2 if `j` is 'B', since `h` was initially 0 or 1 if `j` is 'A' or 1 if `j` is 'B' and we incremented it by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
