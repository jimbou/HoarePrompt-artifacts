The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string a.  If the string has at least 5 characters the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, a has 4 characters, j is the fourth character of a, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 5 characters and the j is the fifth character of a.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fifth character of `a`, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is either 2, 1, 3, or 4 and `h` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `j` is 'B', then `l` is either 1, 2, or 0 and `h` is either 1, 2, or 3.**
