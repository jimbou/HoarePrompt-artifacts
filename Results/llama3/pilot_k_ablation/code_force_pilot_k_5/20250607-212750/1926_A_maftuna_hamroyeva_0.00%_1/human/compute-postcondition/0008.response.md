Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of `a` is 'A', then `l` is 1, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `h` is 1, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.***
