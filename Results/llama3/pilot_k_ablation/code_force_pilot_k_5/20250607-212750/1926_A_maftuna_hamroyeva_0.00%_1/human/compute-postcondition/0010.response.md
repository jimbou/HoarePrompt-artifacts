Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character of `a`, `l` is 2 or 1, `h` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
