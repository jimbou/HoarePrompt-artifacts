Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 4, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 5 characters, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 20 inclusive, stdin contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, j is the fifth character in the string `a`. If j is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 3 and 21 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 19 inclusive. If j is 'B', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 19 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 3 and 21 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `h`, and `j` remain unchanged. The range of `l` has been updated based on the value of `j`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is now between 3 and 21 inclusive, and if `j` is 'B', `l` is now between 1 and 19 inclusive. The stdin still contains t-7 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
