Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the fourth character of `a`, `i` is 0, if `j` is 'A', then `l` is either 2, 1, or 3 and `h` is either 1 or 2, if `j` is 'B', then `l` is either 1 or 0 and `h` is either 2 or 3, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `a` is still a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is still the fourth character of `a`, and `i` is still 0. The value of `h` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is 'A', then `l` can be 2, 1, or 3, and `h` can be 1 or 2. If `j` is 'B', then `l` can be 1 or 0, and `h` can be 2 or 3. The stdin still contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
