Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 inclusive, `l` is an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B and must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `a` and is 'A', and stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it can now be between 1 and 6 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
