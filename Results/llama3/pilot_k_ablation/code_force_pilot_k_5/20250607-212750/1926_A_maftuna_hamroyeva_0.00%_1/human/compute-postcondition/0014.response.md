Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the third character of `a`, `i` is 0, `l` is either 3, 2, or 1, `h` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains t-3 or t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is 'A', then `h` is 0 or 1. If `j` is 'B', then `h` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is 'A', then `l` was initially 2 or 1, so now it is 3 or 2. If `j` is 'B', then `l` was initially 1 or 0, so now it is 2 or 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
