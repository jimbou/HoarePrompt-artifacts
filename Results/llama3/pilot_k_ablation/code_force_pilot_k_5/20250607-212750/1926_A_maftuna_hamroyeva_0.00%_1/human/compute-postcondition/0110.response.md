Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 3, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `l` and `h` are integers between 0 and 16 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the first character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is between 1 and 16 inclusive and `h` is between 0 and 15 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is between 0 and 15 inclusive and `h` is between 1 and 16 inclusive.***
