If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 3 and 15 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 0 and 12 inclusive. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is an integer between 2 and 14 inclusive and `h` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive.
