Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

In this output state, the value of `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, which is the first string from the input. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, and the values of `l`, `h`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, as one string has been consumed by the input operation.
