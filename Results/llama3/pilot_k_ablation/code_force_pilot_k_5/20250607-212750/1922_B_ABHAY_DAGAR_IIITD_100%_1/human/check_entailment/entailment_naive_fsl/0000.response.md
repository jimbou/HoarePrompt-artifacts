Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the answer. The current implementation only considers the case where two sticks have the same length, but it does not consider the case where three sticks have the same length.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 0, but the correct answer is 35. This is because the program only counts the cases where two sticks have the same length, but it does not count the cases where three sticks have the same length.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly count the cases where three sticks have the same length. One possible solution is to use a hash map to store the frequency of each stick length, and then use the frequency to calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks.
