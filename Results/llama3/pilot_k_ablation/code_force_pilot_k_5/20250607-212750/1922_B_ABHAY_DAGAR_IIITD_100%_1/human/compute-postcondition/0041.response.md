To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.


The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.


At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is `n`, we need to increment `n` by 1 for the loop to execute again.


State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, `ans` is either n + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] + hashing[a[n]] if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] + hashing[a[n]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n + n} if a[n] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n+1]: n+1} is added to hashing. If a[i] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: n} is added to hashing.**
