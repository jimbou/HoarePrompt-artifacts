Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+8, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+n+5 in data, and the integer value of the string at index n+n+7 in data, i is 2, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is greater than 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line appends the integer value of the string at index `current_index` in `data` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is `n+n+7`, the appended value is the integer value of the string at index `n+n+7` in `data`.
* The second line increments `current_index` by 1, making it `n+n+8`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of `a` and `current_index`, as well as the unchanged values of all other variables.
