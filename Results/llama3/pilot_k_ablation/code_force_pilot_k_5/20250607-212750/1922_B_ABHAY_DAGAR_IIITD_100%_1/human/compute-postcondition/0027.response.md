Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, `ans` is n + hashing[a[n]] if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, and the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n} if a[n] is not in hashing.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. The value of `hashing[a[n]]` is increased by n. The other variables remain unchanged.
