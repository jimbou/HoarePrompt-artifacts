Output State: **`t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least `n`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{a[i]: i}` for all `i` in range `n`, and `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the `results` list has been updated to include the current value of `ans`, which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
