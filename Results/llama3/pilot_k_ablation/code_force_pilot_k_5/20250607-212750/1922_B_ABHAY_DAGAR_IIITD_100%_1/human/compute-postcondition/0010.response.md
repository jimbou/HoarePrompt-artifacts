Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 6, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 3 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, the integer value of the string at index 4 in data, and the integer value of the string at index 5 in data, i is 3**

The code appends the integer value of the string at the current index in the `data` list to the `a` list and then increments the `current_index` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
