Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 2, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The `results` list remains empty as no elements were added to it. The `current_index` variable was incremented by 1, so it now has a value of 2. The `data` list remains unchanged, but its first element was used to assign a value to `n`. The value of `_` remains 1 as it was not modified. The `hashing` dictionary was initialized as an empty dictionary. The `n` variable was assigned the integer value of the string at index 1 in the `data` list. The `a` list was initialized as an empty list.
