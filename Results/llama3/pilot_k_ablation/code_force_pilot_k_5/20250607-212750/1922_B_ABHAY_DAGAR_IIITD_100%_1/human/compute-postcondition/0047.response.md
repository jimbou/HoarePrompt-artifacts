Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is -1, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pairs {a[j]: sum of indices of a[j] in `a` from index 0 to n-1} for all j from 0 to n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` becomes -1, indicating the end of the loop. The value of `ans` is calculated as the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in the sorted list `a`. The dictionary `hashing` contains the key-value pairs where the keys are the elements in `a` and the values are the sum of the indices of these elements in `a` from index 0 to n-1. The other variables remain unchanged.
