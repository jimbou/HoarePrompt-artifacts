Output State: **t is an integer between 6 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+n+7, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 5, n must be at least 1, a is a list containing the integer at index current_index-1 of data, i is 0, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary**

The code appends the integer at the current_index of data to a, and then increments current_index by 1. This means that a is no longer empty, and current_index has been incremented. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
