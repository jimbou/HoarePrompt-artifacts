Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+6, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 4, n must be greater than 0, a is a list containing the integer at index current_index-1 of data, i is 0, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and hashing is an empty dictionary**

In this output state, the value of `current_index` has been incremented by 1, and the integer at the previous index in `data` has been appended to `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
