Output State: **t is 0, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, current_index is the length of data, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is t, n is the integer value of the string at index current_index-1 in data, a is an empty list, i is -1, ans is 0, and hashing is an empty dictionary.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be as follows:

- The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The variable `results` will be a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` for all test cases.
- The variable `current_index` will be equal to the length of `data`, indicating that all input integers have been processed.
- The variable `data` will remain unchanged, still containing a list of strings representing the input integers.
- The variable `_` will be equal to `t`, which is 0, indicating that the loop has executed all iterations.
- The variable `n` will be the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in `data`, which is the last test case.
- The variable `a` will be an empty list, as it is reinitialized in each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `i` will be -1, as it is used to iterate over the list `a` and will be out of range after the last iteration.
- The variable `ans` will be 0, as it is reinitialized in each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `hashing` will be an empty dictionary, as it is reinitialized in each iteration of the loop.
