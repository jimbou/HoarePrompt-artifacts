Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 3, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, i is 0**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the integer value of the string at index 2 in data to list a. The second line increments current_index by 1, making it 3. No other variables are affected.
