Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is n+2, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, i is n-1, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n-1, `ans` is n-1 if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. If a[n-1] is not in hashing, then hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1}.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is n + hashing[a[n]], otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, and the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n} if a[n] is not in hashing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n+1, `ans` is either n + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n} if a[n] is not in hashing, and the key-value pair {a[n+1]: n+1} is added to hashing.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, `ans` is either n + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] + hashing[a[n]] if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] + hashing[a[n]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n + n} if a[n] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n+1]: n+1} is added to hashing. If a[i] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: n} is added to hashing.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is n + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n]]. Otherwise, `ans` is hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n]]. Hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n + n} if a[n] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n+1]: n+1} is added to hashing. If a[i] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: n} is added to hashing, and hashing[a[i]] is 0. If a[i] is in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: n} is added to hashing, and hashing[a[i]] is increased by i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
