Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+9, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+n+7 in data, and the integer value of the string at index n+n+8 in data, i is 3, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is greater than 3**

Explanation:
The first line appends the integer value of the string at the current index in data to the list a. Since current_index is initially n+n+8, this means the integer value of the string at index n+n+8 in data is added to a.

The second line increments current_index by 1, making it n+n+9.

No other variables are affected by the code. The values of t, results, _, i, ans, and hashing remain unchanged. The value of n is still the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, and a now contains an additional element, which is the integer value of the string at index n+n+8 in data.
