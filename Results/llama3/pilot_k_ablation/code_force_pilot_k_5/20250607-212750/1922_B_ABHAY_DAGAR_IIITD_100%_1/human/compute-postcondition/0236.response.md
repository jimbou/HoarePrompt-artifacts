Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 5, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is 4, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{a[0]: 0}`, `{a[2]: 0}`, `{a[4]: 0}`, `ans` is the value of `a[0]` in `hashing` plus the value of `a[2]` in `hashing` plus the value of `a[4]` in `hashing` which is 0. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` is updated to contain the key-value pair `{a[i]: 0}`.***
