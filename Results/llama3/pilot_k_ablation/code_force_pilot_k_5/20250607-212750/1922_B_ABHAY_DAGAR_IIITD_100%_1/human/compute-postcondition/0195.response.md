Output State: **t is an integer between 6 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+n+6, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 5, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is an empty list, i is n-1, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:

*   The first line creates an empty dictionary called `hashing`.
*   The second line assigns the integer value of the string at index `current_index` in `data` to `n`. Since `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `n` becomes the integer value of the string at index `n+n+n+n+5` in `data`.
*   The third line increments `current_index` by 1, making it `n+n+n+n+6`.
*   The fourth line creates an empty list called `a`.

No other variables are affected by the code. The final state includes the updated values of `n`, `current_index`, `a`, and `hashing`, while keeping the initial values of `t`, `results`, `data`, `_`, `i`, and `ans`.
