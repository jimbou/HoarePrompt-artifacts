The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0 if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` before the execution of the if else block. Otherwise, `hashing` remains unchanged and `hashing[a[i]]` is now equal to `hashing[a[i]] + i` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]] + 1` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]]`.**
