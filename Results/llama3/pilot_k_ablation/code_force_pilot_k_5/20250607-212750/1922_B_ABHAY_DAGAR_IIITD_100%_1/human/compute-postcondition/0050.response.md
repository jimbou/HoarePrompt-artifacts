Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+3, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is an empty list, i is -1, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line initializes an empty dictionary called `hashing`. The second line assigns the integer value of the string at index `current_index` in `data` to `n`, and then increments `current_index` by 1. The third line reinitializes `a` as an empty list. 

After the execution of the code snippet, `n` is updated to the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, and `current_index` is incremented to `n+3`. The list `a` is reinitialized as an empty list, and the dictionary `hashing` is also empty. The values of `t`, `results`, `_`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
