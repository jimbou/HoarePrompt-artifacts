Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+5, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data and the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, i is 1, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows: The first line appends the integer value of the string at index `current_index` in `data` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is `n+4`, the integer value of the string at index `n+4` in `data` is appended to `a`. The second line increments `current_index` by 1, making it `n+5`. No other variables are affected.
