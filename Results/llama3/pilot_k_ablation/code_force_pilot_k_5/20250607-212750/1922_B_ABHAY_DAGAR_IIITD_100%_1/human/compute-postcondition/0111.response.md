Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+n+4, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3 in data, i is n-1, ans is 0, and hashing is an empty dictionary.**

The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order and resets the variable `ans` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
