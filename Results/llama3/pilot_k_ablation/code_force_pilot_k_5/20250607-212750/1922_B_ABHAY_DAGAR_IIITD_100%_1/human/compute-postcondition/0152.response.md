To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+7`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing the integer at index `current_index-1` of `data` and the integer at index `current_index` of `data`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary**
