Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `hashing` for the key `a[0]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value 0 if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[i]]` is 0.**
