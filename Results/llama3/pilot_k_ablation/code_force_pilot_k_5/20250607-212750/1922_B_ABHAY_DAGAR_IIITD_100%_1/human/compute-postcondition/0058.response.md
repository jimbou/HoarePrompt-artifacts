Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+7, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, and the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, i is 3, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary**

Explanation:
The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer value of the string at the current_index in data to the list a. Since current_index is initially n+6, this means the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data is added to a. The second line increments current_index by 1, making it n+7. 

The values of t, results, _, n, i, and hashing remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of ans also remains unchanged as it is not updated in the code. The value of a is updated by adding a new element, and the value of current_index is updated by incrementing it by 1.
