Output State: **t is an integer between 6 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+n+n+6, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 5, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integers at indices current_index-1 to current_index+n-1 of data, i is n-1, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' will contain 'n' integers from the 'data' list, starting from the index 'current_index-1' to 'current_index+n-1'. The variable 'i' will be equal to 'n-1', and the 'current_index' will be incremented by 'n' times. The other variables remain unchanged.
