Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of `a[i]` in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n-1` times. The value of `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`. The `hashing` dictionary now contains the sum of the indices of all occurrences of each element in `a`. The other variables, such as `t`, `results`, `current_index`, `data`, `_`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
