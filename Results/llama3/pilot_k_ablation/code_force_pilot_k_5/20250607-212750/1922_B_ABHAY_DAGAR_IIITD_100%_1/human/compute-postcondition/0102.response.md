Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+6, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+n+4 in data and the integer value of the string at index n+n+5 in data, i is 1, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is greater than 0**

The code appends the integer value of the string at the current_index in data to the list a, and then increments the current_index by 1. The current_index was initially n+n+5, so after the increment, it becomes n+n+6. The list a now contains the integer value of the string at index n+n+4 in data and the integer value of the string at index n+n+5 in data. All other variables remain unchanged.
