Output State: **`t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is 3, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{a[0]: 0}` if `a[0]` is not already in `hashing`, otherwise, the value of `a[0]` in `hashing` is incremented by 0, and if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, `{a[i]: 0}` is added to `hashing`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to the value of `a[0]` in `hashing` plus the value of `a[i]` in `hashing` which is 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and the value of `a[i]` in `hashing` is incremented by `i`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` is updated to contain the key-value pair `{a[2]: 0}` and `ans` is the value of `a[0]` in `hashing` plus the value of `a[2]` in `hashing` which is 0. `hashing[a[2]]` is incremented by 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by the value of `a[2]` in `hashing` which is 0. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` is updated to contain the key-value pair `{a[i]: 0}`. `hashing[a[i]]` is incremented by `i` which is 3. `ans` is incremented by the value of `a[3]` in `hashing` which is 0 or 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been incremented by the value of `a[3]` in the `hashing` dictionary, which is either 0 or 3, depending on whether `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]` or not.
