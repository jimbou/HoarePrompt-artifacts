Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is 3, `ans` is `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is `hashing[a[i]]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is either `hashing[a[i]] + 3` if `a[i]` is already in `hashing`, or `hashing[a[i]] + 3` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` and `hashing[a[i]]` is 0, and `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i` which is 3. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[i]]` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by 3, where `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the sorted list `a`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
