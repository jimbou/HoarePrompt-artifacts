Output State: `t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pairs `{a[0]: 0}`, `{a[1]: 1}`, `{a[2]: 2}`, ..., `{a[n-1]: n-1}`, and `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the dictionary `hashing` now contains key-value pairs for all elements in the list `a`, where each key is an element in `a` and its corresponding value is the index of that element in `a`. The variable `ans` has been updated to include the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
