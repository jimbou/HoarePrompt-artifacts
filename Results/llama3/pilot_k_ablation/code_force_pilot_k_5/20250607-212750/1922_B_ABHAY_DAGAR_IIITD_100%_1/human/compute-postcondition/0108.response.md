Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+10, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+n+8 in data, and the integer value of the string at index n+n+9 in data, i is 4, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is greater than 4**

The code appends the integer value of the string at the current index in the data list to the list a, and then increments the current index by 1. This means that the list a now contains an additional element, which is the integer value of the string at index n+n+9 in the data list. The current index is now n+n+10. All other variables remain unchanged.
