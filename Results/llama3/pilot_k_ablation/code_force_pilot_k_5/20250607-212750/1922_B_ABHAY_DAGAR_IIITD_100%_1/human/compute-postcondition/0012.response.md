Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 7, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 4 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, the integer value of the string at index 4 in data, the integer value of the string at index 5 in data, and the integer value of the string at index 6 in data, i is 4**

In this final state, the value of `current_index` has been incremented by 1, and the list `a` has been appended with the integer value of the string at index 6 in `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.
