Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t times (n integers: first an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, current_index is 1, data is a list of strings representing the input integers
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    hashing = {}
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(data[current_index]))
        current_index += 1
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] not in hashing:
            hashing[a[i]] = 0
        hashing[a[i]] += i
        if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
            ans += hashing[a[i]]
    results.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is -1, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pairs {a[j]: sum of indices of a[j] in `a` from index 0 to n-1} for all j from 0 to n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is n-1, `ans` is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the indices of the elements in `a` as keys and their corresponding values as the sum of the indices of consecutive equal elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of `a[i]` in `a`, and `results` now also contains the value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least `n`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{a[i]: i}` for all `i` in range `n`, and `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
