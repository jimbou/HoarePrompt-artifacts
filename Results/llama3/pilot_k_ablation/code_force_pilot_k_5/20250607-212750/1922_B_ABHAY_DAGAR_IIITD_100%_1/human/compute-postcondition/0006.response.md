Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 4, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data and the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `current_index` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. The list `a` now contains two elements: the integer value of the string at index 2 in `data` and the integer value of the string at index 3 in `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.
