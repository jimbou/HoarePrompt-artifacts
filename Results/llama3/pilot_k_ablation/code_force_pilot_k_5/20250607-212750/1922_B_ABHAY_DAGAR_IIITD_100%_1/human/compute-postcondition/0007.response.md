To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in `data`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is not changed, it remains an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in `data`. However, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is 4, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in `data`, `a` is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in `data` and the integer value of the string at index 3 in `data`, `i` is 2**
