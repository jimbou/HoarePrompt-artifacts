Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `hashing` dictionary now contains a single key-value pair where the key is the value of `a[i]` (which is the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`) and the value is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
