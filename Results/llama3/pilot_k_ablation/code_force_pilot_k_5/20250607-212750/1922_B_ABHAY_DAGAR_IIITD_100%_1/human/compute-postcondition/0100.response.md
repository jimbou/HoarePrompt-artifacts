Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+5, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+n+4 in data, i is 0, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and hashing is an empty dictionary, n is greater than 0**

The code appends the integer value of the string at index `current_index` in `data` to the list `a`, and then increments `current_index` by 1. As a result, `a` now contains the integer value of the string at index `n+n+4` in `data`, and `current_index` is now `n+n+5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
