Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least `n`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{a[i]: i}` for all `i` in range `n`, and `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The `results` list now contains the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` for each iteration of the loop. The `current_index` has been incremented to point to the next set of input integers in `data`. The value of `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, which must be at least `n`. The `a` list contains the sorted integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`. The `i` variable has reached its final value of `n-1`. The `hashing` dictionary contains the key-value pair `{a[i]: i}` for all `i` in range `n`. Finally, the `ans` variable holds the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.
