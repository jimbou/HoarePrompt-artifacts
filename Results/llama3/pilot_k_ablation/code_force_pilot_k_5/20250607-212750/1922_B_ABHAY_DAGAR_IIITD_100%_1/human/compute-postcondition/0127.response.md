Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 2, `hashing[a[i]]` is 0, `ans` is either `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]` or `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `hashing[a[i]]` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on whether `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, but the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is now 0.
