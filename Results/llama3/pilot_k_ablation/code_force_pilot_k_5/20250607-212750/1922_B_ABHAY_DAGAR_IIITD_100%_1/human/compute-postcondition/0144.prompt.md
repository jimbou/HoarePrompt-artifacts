Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+n+4, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3 in data, i is n-1, ans is 0, and hashing is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0 if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` before the execution of the if else block. Otherwise, `hashing` remains unchanged and `hashing[a[i]]` is now equal to `hashing[a[i]] + i` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]] + 0` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 1, if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with a value of `hashing[a[i]] + 1` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` before the execution of the if else block. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` and `hashing` remains unchanged and `hashing[a[i]]` is now equal to `hashing[a[i]] + 1` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 2, `hashing[a[i]]` is either `hashing[a[i]] + 2` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` or remains unchanged if `a[i]` is in `hashing`, and `ans` is either `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]` or `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 3, `hashing[a[i]]` is either `0 + 3` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` or `hashing[a[i]] + 3` if `a[i]` is in `hashing`, and `ans` is either `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]` or `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 4, `hashing[a[i]]` is either `hashing[a[i]] + 4` if `a[i]` is in `hashing` or 4 if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, and `ans` is either `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]` or `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[i]]` is 4 and `ans` is either `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]` or `4 + 4 + 4 + 4` if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
