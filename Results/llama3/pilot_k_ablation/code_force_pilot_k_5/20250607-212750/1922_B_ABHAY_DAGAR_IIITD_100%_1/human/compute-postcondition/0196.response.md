To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary**
