The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is -1, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pairs {a[j]: sum of indices of a[j] in `a` from index 0 to n-1} for all j from 0 to n-1**
