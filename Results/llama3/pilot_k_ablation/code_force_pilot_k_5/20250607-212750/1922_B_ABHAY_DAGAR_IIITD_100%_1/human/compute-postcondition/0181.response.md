Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is 3, `ans` is `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is `hashing[a[i]]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is 0.**

The code resets the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to 0, which affects the values of `ans` and `hashing`. The value of `ans` is now either 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, or 0 + 0 if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, which simplifies to 0. The value of `hashing` is updated to have a value of 0 for the key `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
