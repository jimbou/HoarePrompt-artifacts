Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0 if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` before the execution of the if else block. Otherwise, `hashing` remains unchanged and `hashing[a[i]]` is now equal to `hashing[a[i]] + i` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]] + 0` which is equal to `hashing[a[i]]`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `hashing[a[i]]` has been updated to be equal to its previous value plus `i`, which is 0.
