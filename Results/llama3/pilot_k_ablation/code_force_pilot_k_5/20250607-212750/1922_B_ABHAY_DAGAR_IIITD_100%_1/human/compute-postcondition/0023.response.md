To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n`.

However, since `i` is now equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n - 1` is no longer true. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

But, we need to adjust the state of `n` to make the loop condition true again. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, we can increment `n` by 1 to make the loop condition true again.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, `ans` is n if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. If a[n-1] is not in hashing, then hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1}.**
