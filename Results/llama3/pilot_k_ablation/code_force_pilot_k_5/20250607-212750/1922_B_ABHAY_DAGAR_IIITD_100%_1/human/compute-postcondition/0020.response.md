Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 0. If a[n-1] is not in hashing, then hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1}. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`***
