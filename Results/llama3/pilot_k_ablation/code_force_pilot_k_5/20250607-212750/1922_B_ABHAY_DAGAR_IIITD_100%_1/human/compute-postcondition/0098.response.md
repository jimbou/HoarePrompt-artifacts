The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `hashing`, updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the string at the current index in `data`, increments the `current_index` by 1, and reinitializes the list `a` as an empty list.

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The dictionary `hashing` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
*   The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the string at the current index in `data`. This means that `n` now holds the value of the string at index `n+n+3` in `data`.
*   The `current_index` is incremented by 1, so it now points to the next index in `data`.
*   The list `a` is reinitialized as an empty list, discarding its previous values.

Considering the initial state and the changes made by the code, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+4, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is an empty list, i is n-1, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and hashing is an empty dictionary.**
