Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+n+5, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 4, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a sorted list containing the integer at index n+n+n+5 of data, the integer at index n+n+n+6 of data, ..., the integer at index n+n+n+n+4 of data, i is n-1, ans is 0, and hashing is an empty dictionary.**

The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order and resets the value of `ans` to 0. The sorting of `a` does not affect any other variables, and the reset of `ans` only changes its value to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
