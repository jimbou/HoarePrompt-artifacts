To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `results`, `current_index`, `data`, `_`, `a`, `ans`, and `hashing`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+8`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a list containing the integer value of the string at index `n+n+4` in `data`, the integer value of the string at index `n+n+5` in `data`, and the integer value of the string at index `n+n+7` in `data`, `i` is 3, `ans` is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than 3**
