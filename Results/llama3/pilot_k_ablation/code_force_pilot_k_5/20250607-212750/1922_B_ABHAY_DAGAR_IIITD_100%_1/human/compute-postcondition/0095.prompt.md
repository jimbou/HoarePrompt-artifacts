Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+3, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, i is n-1, ans is 0, hashing is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to the value of `hashing` for the key `a[0]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value 0 if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `hashing` for the key `a[0]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing` for the key `a[i]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is 2, `ans` is equal to the value of `hashing` for the key `a[0]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing` for the key `a[i]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value 0, and `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is 3, `ans` is equal to the value of `hashing` for the key `a[0]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing` for the key `a[i]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value 0, and `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value 0, and `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`. `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to the value of `hashing` for the key `a[0]` and is increased by the value of `hashing` for the key `a[i]`. `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value 0, and `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
