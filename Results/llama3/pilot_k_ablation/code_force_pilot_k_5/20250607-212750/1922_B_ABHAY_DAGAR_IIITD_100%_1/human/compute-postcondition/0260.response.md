Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and all elements in the `results` list have been printed. The values of `t`, `current_index`, `data`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `hashing` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed its iterations, and all the elements in the `results` list have been printed. The values of the other variables, which were not affected by the loop, remain the same as they were before the loop started.
