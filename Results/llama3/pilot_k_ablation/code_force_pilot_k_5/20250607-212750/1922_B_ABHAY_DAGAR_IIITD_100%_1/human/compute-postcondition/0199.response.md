Output State: **t is an integer between 6 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+n+8, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 5, n must be at least 2, a is a list containing the integer at index current_index-1 of data and the integer at index current_index of data, i is 1, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, hashing is an empty dictionary**

In this output state, the value of `current_index` has been incremented by 1, and the list `a` now contains the integer at index `current_index-1` of `data` and the integer at index `current_index` of `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.
