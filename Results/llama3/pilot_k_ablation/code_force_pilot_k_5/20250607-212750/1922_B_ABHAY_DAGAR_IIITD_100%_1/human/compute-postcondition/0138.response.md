To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

Since `n` is already at least 3, it does not need to be adjusted.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `results`, `current_index`, `data`, `_`, `a`, `hashing`, and `ans`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is 4, `hashing[a[i]]` is either `0 + 3` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` or `hashing[a[i]] + 3` if `a[i]` is in `hashing`, and `ans` is either `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]` or `hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]] + hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`.**
