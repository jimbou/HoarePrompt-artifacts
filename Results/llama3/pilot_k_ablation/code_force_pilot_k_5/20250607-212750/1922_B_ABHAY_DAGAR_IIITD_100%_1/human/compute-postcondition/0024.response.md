Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, `ans` is n if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. If a[n-1] is not in hashing, then hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1}, and hashing now contains the key-value pair {a[n]: 0}.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the dictionary `hashing` now contains an additional key-value pair where the key is the value of `a[n]` and the value is 0.
