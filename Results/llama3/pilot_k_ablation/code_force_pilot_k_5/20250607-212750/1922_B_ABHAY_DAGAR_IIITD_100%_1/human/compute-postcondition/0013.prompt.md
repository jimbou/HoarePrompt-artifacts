Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 2, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(int(data[current_index]))
    current_index += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 3, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 4, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data and the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 5, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, and the integer value of the string at index 4 in data, i is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 6, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 3 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, the integer value of the string at index 4 in data, and the integer value of the string at index 5 in data, i is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is 7, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than 4 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, the integer value of the string at index 4 in data, the integer value of the string at index 5 in data, and the integer value of the string at index 6 in data, i is 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
