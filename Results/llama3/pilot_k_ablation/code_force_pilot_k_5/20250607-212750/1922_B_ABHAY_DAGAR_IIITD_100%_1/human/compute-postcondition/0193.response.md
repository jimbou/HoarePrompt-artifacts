Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of `a[i]` in `a`, and `results` now also contains the value of `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `results` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
