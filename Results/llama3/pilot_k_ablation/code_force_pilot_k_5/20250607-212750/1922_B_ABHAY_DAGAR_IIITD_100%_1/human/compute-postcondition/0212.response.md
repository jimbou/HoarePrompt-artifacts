Output State: **`t` is an integer between 6 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+n+6`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 5, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integers at indices `current_index-1` to `current_index+n-1` of `data`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{a[0]: 0}` if `a[0]` is not already in `hashing`, otherwise, the value of `a[0]` in `hashing` is incremented by 0.**

In this output state, the only change is in the `hashing` dictionary. The value of `a[0]` in `hashing` is incremented by `i`, which is 0. If `a[0]` is not already in `hashing`, it is added with a value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
