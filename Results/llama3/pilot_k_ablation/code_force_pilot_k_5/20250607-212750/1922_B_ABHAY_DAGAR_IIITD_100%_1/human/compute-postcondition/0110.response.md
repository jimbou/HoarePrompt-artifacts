Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, current_index is n+n+n+4, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 3, n is the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, a is a list containing the integer values of the strings at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3 in data, i is n-1, ans is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and hashing is an empty dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The value of `results` remains unchanged, still a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.
- The value of `current_index` is now `n+n+n+4`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times.
- The value of `data` remains unchanged, still a list of strings representing the input integers.
- The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 3.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, still the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`.
- The value of `a` is now a list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, indicating that the loop has appended `n` elements to `a`.
- The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged, still equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.
- The value of `hashing` remains unchanged, still an empty dictionary.
