Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+n+5`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer at index `n+n+n+5` of `data`, the integer at index `n+n+n+6` of `data`, ..., the integer at index `n+n+n+n+4` of `data`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `hashing[a[i]]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, `hashing` contains a single key-value pair where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is 0. Otherwise, `hashing` contains a single key-value pair where the key is the value of `a[i]` and the value is `hashing[a[i]] + i`. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been updated to be equal to the value of `hashing[a[i]]`, which is the sum of the indices of the consecutive equal elements in `a` that have the same value as `a[i]`. The value of `hashing[a[i]]` is either 0 (if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`) or `hashing[a[i]] + i` (if `a[i]` is in `hashing`).
