Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+10, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 4, n is greater than 4, a is a list containing the integer at index n+n+n+7 of data, the integer at index n+n+n+8 of data, the integer at index n+n+n+9 of data, the integer at index n+n+n+9 of data, and the integer at index n+n+n+10 of data, i is 4, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and hashing is an empty dictionary**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends the integer at index `current_index` of `data` to the end of list `a`. Since `current_index` is `n+n+n+9`, this means that the integer at index `n+n+n+9` of `data` is appended to `a`.
*   The second line increments `current_index` by 1, making it `n+n+n+10`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the values of `current_index` and `a` updated according to the changes made by the code.
