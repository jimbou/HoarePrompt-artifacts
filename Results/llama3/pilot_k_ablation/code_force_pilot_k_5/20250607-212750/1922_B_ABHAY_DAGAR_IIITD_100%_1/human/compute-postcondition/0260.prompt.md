Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, current_index is the length of data, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is t, n is the integer value of the string at index current_index-1 in data, a is an empty list, i is -1, ans is 0, and hashing is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, `current_index` is the length of data, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in data, `a` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, and the first element in the list `results` which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, `current_index` is the length of data, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in data, `a` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, and the second element in the list `results` which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements which are the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, `current_index` is the length of data, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in data, `a` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, and the third element in the list `results` which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a test case is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 4 elements which are the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, `current_index` is the length of data, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in data, `a` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, and the fourth element in the list `results` which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a test case is being printed, the fourth element in the list `results` which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a test case is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `result` is the fifth element of the `results` list, `current_index` is the length of data, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in data, `a` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, and the fifth element of the `results` list which is `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
