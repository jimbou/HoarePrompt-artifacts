Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+7 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+8 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+9 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+10 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+11 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+12 in data, `i` is n-1, `ans` is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `ans` will be equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, and `hashing` will be a dictionary containing the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing` otherwise `hashing` contains the current value of `a[i]` as a key with value `i` + `hashing[a[i]]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
