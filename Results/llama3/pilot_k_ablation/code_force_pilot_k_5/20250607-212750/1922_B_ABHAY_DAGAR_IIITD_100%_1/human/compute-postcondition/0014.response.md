Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, current_index is n+2, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 1, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, a is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, i is n-1, ans is 0**

In this output state, the list `a` has been sorted in ascending order, and a new variable `ans` has been introduced with a value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
