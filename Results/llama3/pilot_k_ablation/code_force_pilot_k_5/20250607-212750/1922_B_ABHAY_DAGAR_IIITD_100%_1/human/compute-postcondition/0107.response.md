To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is already greater than 3, it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `current_index` is `n+n+9`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a list containing the integer value of the string at index `n+n+4` in `data`, the integer value of the string at index `n+n+5` in `data`, the integer value of the string at index `n+n+7` in `data`, and the integer value of the string at index `n+n+8` in `data`, `i` is 4, `ans` is equal to the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than 4**
