Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a and ans, current_index is n+n+n+9, data is a list of strings representing the input integers, _ is 4, n is greater than 3, a is a list containing the integer at index current_index-2 of data, the integer at index current_index-1 of data, the integer at index current_index of data, and the integer at index current_index of data, i is 3, ans is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, and hashing is an empty dictionary**

The code appends the integer at index `current_index` of `data` to `a` and increments `current_index` by 1. The value of `current_index` changes from `n+n+n+8` to `n+n+n+9`. The list `a` now contains the integer at index `current_index-2` of `data`, the integer at index `current_index-1` of `data`, the integer at index `current_index` of `data`, and the newly appended integer at index `current_index` of `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.
