The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `current_index` is n+7, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4 and equal to the integer value of the string at index n+2 in data, `a` is a list containing the integer value of the string at index n+3 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+4 in data, the integer value of the string at index n+5 in data, and the integer value of the string at index n+6 in data, `i` is 4, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a, `hashing` is an empty dictionary**
