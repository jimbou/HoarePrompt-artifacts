Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and equal to the value of the string at index 1 in data, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is not in the dictionary `hashing`.***
