Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n, `ans` is either n + hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]] if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]] + hashing[a[n+1]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n + n} if a[n] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n+1]: n+1} is added to hashing. If a[i] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: n} is added to hashing.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of hashing[a[i]] has been updated to hashing[a[i]] + i. The value of hashing[a[i]] is now equal to hashing[a[i]] + n, since i is equal to n. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
