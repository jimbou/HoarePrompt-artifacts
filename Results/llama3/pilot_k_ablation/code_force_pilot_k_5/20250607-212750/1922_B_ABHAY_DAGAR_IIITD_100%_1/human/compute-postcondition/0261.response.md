Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain an integer t, followed by t sets of data, each set consisting of an integer n and n integers a_1 to a_n. The function calculates the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in each set and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list. The function does not modify the input data or any external state, and its only output is the printed results.**
