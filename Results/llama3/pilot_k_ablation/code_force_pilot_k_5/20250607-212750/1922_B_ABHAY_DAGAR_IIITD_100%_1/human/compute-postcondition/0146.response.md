To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 4. The value of `t` remains the same.

The states of the other objects (`results`, `current_index`, `data`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `hashing`) do not need to be adjusted, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 4, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the indices of the elements in `a` as keys and their corresponding values as the sum of the indices of consecutive equal elements.**
