The code prints the third element in the list `results`. The list `results` contains at least 3 elements which are the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases. Since the exact elements in the list `results` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the third element. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element in the list `results`.

Output: **the third element in the list results (which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases)**
