To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `results` to have at least one element.

State: **`t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in a for all test cases, `current_index` is the length of data, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is `t`, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `current_index-1` in data, `a` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `result` is the first element in the list `results`**
