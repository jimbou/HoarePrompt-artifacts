Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is n+3, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of the string at index 2 in data, the integer value of the string at index 3 in data, ..., and the integer value of the string at index n+1 in data, `i` is n+1, if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is n + hashing[a[n]], otherwise `ans` is hashing[a[n]], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[n-1]: n-1} if a[n-1] is not in hashing, the key-value pair {a[n]: hashing[a[n]] + n} if a[n] is not in hashing, and if `a[i]` is not in hashing, then the key-value pair {a[n+1]: 0} is added to hashing, and hashing[a[n+1]] is now equal to n+1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of hashing[a[n+1]] has been updated to n+1. This means that the dictionary hashing now contains the key-value pair {a[n+1]: n+1}, in addition to the other key-value pairs that were present in the initial state.
