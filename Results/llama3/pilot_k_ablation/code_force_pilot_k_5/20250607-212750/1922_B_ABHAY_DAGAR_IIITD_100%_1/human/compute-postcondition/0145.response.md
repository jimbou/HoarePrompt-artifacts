Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a` and `ans`, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input integers, `_` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the string at index `n+2` in `data`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3` in `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`, and `hashing` is a dictionary containing the indices of the elements in `a` as keys and their corresponding values as the sum of the indices of consecutive equal elements.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the value of `ans`, the sum of the products of the indices of consecutive equal elements in `a`.
