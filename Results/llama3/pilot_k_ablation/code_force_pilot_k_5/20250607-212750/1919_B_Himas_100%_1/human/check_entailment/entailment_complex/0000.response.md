Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3.  It initializes two counters, `P` and `M`, to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.
4.  It then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '+', it increments `P`; if the character is '-', it increments `M`.
5.  Finally, it prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the input string into '+' and '-' characters, counts the number of each, and calculates the absolute difference between the two counts. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty, as the problem statement defines the penalty of a single array as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
