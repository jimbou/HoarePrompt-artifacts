Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and printing the absolute difference between the two counts.

The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the input string (which is not used in the program) and the input string itself.
3. It initializes two variables, P and M, to 0. P will count the number of '+' characters, and M will count the number of '-' characters.
4. It iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is '+', it increments P. If the character is '-', it increments M.
5. Finally, it prints the absolute difference between P and M, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string. The absolute difference between the two counts represents the minimum possible penalty, as it is the minimum number of subarrays that can be created to achieve the minimum penalty.

Correctness: **True**
