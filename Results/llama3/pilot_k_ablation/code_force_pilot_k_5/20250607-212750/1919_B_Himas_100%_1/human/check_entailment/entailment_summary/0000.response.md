Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The program iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the count of '+' characters (P) or '-' characters (M) accordingly. Finally, it prints the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are split such that the sum of each array is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the sum of each array is minimized.

The program's implementation is also efficient, as it only requires a single pass through the input string to calculate the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
