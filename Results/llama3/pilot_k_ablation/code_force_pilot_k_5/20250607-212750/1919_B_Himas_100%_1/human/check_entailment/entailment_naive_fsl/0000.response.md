Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then printing the absolute difference between the two counts. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in a penalty equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the string contains only '+' characters, the program prints 0, which is the minimum possible penalty.
* When the string contains only '-' characters, the program prints the length of the string, which is the minimum possible penalty.
* When the string contains a mix of '+' and '-' characters, the program prints the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases correctly.
