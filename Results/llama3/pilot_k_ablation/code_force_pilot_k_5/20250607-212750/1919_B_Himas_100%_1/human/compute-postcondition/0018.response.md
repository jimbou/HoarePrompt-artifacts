Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 4 characters, q is the fourth character in the string e. If the fourth character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 2. If the fourth character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 3. If the fourth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 4.**

In this output state, the value of M has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for P and M are updated based on the value of the fourth character in the string e.
