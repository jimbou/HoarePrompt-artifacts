To determine what will be printed when the `print(abs(P - M))` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **s**: An integer equal to the new input value.
2. **e**: A string equal to the new input value.
3. **i**: An integer with a value of 3.
4. **P**: The number of '+' characters in the string **e**.
5. **M**: The number of characters in the string **e** that are not '+'.

The `print` statement calculates the absolute difference between **P** and **M**, which are the counts of '+' characters and non-'+' characters in the string **e**, respectively.

Since the exact value of the new input (which is both the integer **s** and the string **e**) is not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of **P** and **M**. However, we can describe what will be printed based on the given information:

The `print` statement will output the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string **e**.

Output: **The absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string e**
