Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If the third character in the string `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `M` is now 1. If the third character in the string `e` is not '+', then `M` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
