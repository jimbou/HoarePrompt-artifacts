To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved are `i` and the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The input value is not explicitly defined, but it is used to determine the range of the loop. Since `i` is 3, the input value must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `s`, `e`, `P`, and `M` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value, `i` is 4, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+', and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the string `e` is being printed**
