Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 5000). The second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(abs(P - M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is an empty string, P is the number of '+' characters in the string e which is 0, M is the number of '-' characters in the string e which is 0, and the absolute difference between P and M which is 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: s is an integer equal to the input value, e is a string equal to the input value, i is 1, P is equal to the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string e, and the absolute difference between P and M is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string e, and the absolute difference between P and M is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is an integer equal to the new input value, e is a string equal to the new input value, i is 2, P is equal to the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is equal to the number of characters in the string e that are not '+', and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the string e is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: s is an integer equal to the new input value, e is a string equal to the new input value, i is 3, P is the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is the number of characters in the string e that are not '+', and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the string e is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value, `i` is 4, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` is the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+', and the absolute difference between P and M is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
