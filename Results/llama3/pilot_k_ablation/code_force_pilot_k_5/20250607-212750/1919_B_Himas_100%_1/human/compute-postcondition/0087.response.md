Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 1 character, `i` is 3, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, and `q` is the first character in the string `e` and `q` is not '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values. The string `e` still has at least one character, and `q` remains the first character of `e`, which is not '+'.
