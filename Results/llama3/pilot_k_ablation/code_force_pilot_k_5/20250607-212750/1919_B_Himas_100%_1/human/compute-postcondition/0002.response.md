According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If the string `e` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string, P is 0, M is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `e` is not empty and q is the first character in the string `e`. 
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that is not empty, P is 0, M is 0, q is the first character in the string `e`**
