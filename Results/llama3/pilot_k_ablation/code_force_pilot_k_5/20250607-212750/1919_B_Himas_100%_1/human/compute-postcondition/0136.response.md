Output State: **stdin contains no test cases, i is equal to the number of test cases, s is an integer equal to the last input value, e is a string equal to the last input value, P is the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is the number of '-' characters in the string e, and the absolute difference between P and M is printed.**

This output state means that the loop has finished executing all the iterations. The input has been fully processed, and the final values of the variables are determined by the last test case. The loop counter `i` is equal to the number of test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `s` and `e` hold the values from the last test case. The variables `P` and `M` hold the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the last test case, respectively. Finally, the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is printed, which represents the result of the last test case.
