Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is 3, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 3. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, regardless of the value of `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `P` is still dependent on the value of `q`, but the value of `M` has been updated accordingly.
