To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` is not empty, the loop will execute.

State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must not be empty, `i` is 4, `P` is 0, `M` is 0, `q` is the first character in the string `e`**
