Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is 3, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 3, and if `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
