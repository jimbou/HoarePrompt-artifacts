The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() must have at least 1 test case and the i is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, i is 0**
