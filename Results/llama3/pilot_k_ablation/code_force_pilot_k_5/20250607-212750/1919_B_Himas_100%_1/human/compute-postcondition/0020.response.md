To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`, and `e` must have at least 4 characters. For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least 5 characters, and `q` must be the fifth character in the string `e`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 5 characters, q is the fifth character in the string e. If the fifth character in the string e is '+', then P is 4 and M is 0. If the fifth character in the string e is '-', then P is 3 and M is 1. If the fifth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 2 and M is 2. If the fifth character in the string e is '+', then P is 3 and M is 1. If the fifth character in the string e is '-', then P is 2 and M is 2. If the fifth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 1 and M is 3. If the fifth character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 2. If the fifth character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 3. If the fifth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 4.**
