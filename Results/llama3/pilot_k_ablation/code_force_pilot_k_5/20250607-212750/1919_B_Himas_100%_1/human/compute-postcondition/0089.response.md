The only variable in the loop head is `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If the string `e` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` has at least 1 character, `q` is the first character in the string `e`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 2 characters and the `q` is the second character in the string `e`.
State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 3. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
