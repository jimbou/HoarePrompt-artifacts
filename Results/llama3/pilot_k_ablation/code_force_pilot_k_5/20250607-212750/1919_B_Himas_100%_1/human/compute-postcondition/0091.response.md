Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 3. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. The values of `s`, `e`, `i`, `P` are still the same as in the initial state. The condition for `P` and `M` still depends on the second character of the string `e`. If the second character is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1 (which was 0 in the initial state). Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2 (which was 1 in the initial state).
