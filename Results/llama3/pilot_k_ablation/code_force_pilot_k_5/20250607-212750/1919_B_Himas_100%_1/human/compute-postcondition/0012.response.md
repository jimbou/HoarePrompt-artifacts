To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` has at least 2 characters, and `q` is the second character in the string `e`.

For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least 3 characters, and `q` must be the third character in the string `e`.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 3 characters, q is the third character in the string e. If the third character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 0. Otherwise, if the third character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 1. If the third character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 2.**
