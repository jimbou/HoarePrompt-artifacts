Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value with at least 5 characters, `i` is 4, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is increased by 2 from its previous value based on the value of `q`, and `M` has a value based on the value of `q`. Otherwise, `P` has a value based on the value of `q` increased by 1, and `M` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q`.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been increased by 1, regardless of the value of `q`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
