To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, and `e` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least one more character.

Since `q` is the second character in the string `e`, for the loop to execute again, `q` must be the next character in the string `e`. Therefore, `q` must be the third character in the string `e`.

The other variables `s`, `P`, and `M` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value with at least 3 characters, `i` is 4, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
