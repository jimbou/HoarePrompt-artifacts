Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value, `i` is 4, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 2, and `M` remains 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1, and `M` remains 1. The values of `s`, `e`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged.
