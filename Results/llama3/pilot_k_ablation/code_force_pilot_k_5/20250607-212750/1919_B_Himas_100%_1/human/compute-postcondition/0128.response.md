To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`.

According to the code, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`, and `e` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters. For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least 5 characters, and `q` must be the fifth character in the string `e`.

State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value with at least 5 characters, `i` is 4, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q`, and `M` has a value based on the value of `q`. Otherwise, `P` has a value based on the value of `q`, and `M` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q`.**
