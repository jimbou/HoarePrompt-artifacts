Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 1 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2, `M` is 0, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1, `M` is 1, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 2, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is now 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is now 0. The values of `s`, `e`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged.
