Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value with at least 5 characters, `i` is 4, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q`, and `M` has a value based on the value of `q` plus 1. Otherwise, `P` has a value based on the value of `q`, and `M` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `M` is increased by 1 regardless of the value of `q`. The values of `s`, `e`, `i`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `P` is still based on the value of `q`, but the value of `M` is updated to be one more than its previous value.
