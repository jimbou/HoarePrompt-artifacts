The only object in the loop head is variable  q and string e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e.  If the string has at least 5 characters the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 4 characters, q is the fourth character in the string e, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 5 characters and the q is the fifth character in the string e.
State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 4 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then either `P` is 5 and `M` is 1 with an absolute difference of 4, or `P` is 4 and `M` is 2 with an absolute difference of 2. If `q` is not '+', then either `P` is 2 and `M` is 4 with an absolute difference of 2, or `P` is 1 and `M` is 5 with an absolute difference of 4.**
