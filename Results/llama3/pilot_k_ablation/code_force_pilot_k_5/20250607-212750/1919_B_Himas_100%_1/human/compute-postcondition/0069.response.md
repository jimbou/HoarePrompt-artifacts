If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If the third character in the string `e` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If the third character in the string `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.***
