Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 3 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 1, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 4, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `s`, `e`, `i`, `q`, and `P` remain unchanged. The relationship between `P` and `M` has also been updated to reflect the new value of `M`.
