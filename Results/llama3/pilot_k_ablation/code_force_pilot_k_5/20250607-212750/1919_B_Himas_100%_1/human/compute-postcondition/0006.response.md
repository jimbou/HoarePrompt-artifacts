Output State: **`M` is 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a string that is not empty, `P` is 0, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `q` is not '+', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `M` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
