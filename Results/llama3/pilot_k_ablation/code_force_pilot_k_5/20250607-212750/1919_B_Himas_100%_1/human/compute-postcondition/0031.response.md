Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 0 characters long, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 1, `i` is 1, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and the current value of `q` is '+'**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `P` being 1. The absolute difference between `P` and `M` is now 1, since `M` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being an integer equal to the input value, `e` being a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 0 characters long, `i` being 1, and `q` being the first character in the string `e` with a value of '+'.
