Postcondition: ***stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 3 characters, q is the third character in the string e. If the third character in the string e is '+', then P is 3 and M is 0. If the third character in the string e is '-', then P is 2 and M is 1. If the third character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 1 and M is 2. If the third character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 1. If the third character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 2. If the third character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 3.***
