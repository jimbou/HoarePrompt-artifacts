The only variable in the loop head is `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If the string `e` has at least 4 characters the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` has at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 4 characters and the `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. The other variables are not in the loop head, so they remain the same.
State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 3 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 3. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 3.**
