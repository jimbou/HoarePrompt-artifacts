Postcondition: ***s is an integer equal to the input value, e is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 0 characters long, i is 1, q is the first character in the string e. If q is '+', then P is 1, M is 0, and the absolute difference between P and M is 1. If q is not '+', then P is 0, M is 1, and the absolute difference between P and M is 1.***
