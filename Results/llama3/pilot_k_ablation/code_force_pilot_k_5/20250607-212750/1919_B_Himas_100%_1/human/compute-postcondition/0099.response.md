Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is 3, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `M` is now dependent on the value of `q`, which is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `M` is 2, otherwise it is 4. The values of `s`, `e`, `i`, `P`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state.
