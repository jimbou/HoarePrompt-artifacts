Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that is not empty, P is 1, M is 0, q is the first character in the string `e`, and the current value of q is '+'**

In this output state, the value of P has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, i is still 0, s is still an integer, e is still a string that is not empty, M is still 0, and q is still the first character in the string `e` with a value of '+'.
