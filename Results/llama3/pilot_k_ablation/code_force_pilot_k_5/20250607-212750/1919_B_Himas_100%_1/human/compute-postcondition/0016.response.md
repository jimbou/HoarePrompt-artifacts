The only objects in the loop head are variables  q and e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e.  If the string e has at least 4 characters the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 3 characters, q is the third character in the string e. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string e must have at least 4 characters and the q is the fourth character in the string e.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 4 characters, q is the fourth character in the string e. If the fourth character in the string e is '+', then P is 3 and M is 0. If the fourth character in the string e is '-', then P is 2 and M is 1. If the fourth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 1 and M is 2. If the fourth character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 1. If the fourth character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 2. If the fourth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 3.**
