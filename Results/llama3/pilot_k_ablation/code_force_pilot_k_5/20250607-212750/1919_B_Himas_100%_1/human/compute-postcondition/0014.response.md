Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, if the third character in the string `e` is '-', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. If the third character in the string `e` is neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 0, `s` is still an integer, and `e` is still a string with at least 3 characters. The third character of `e` is still stored in `q`. The values of `P` and `M` depend on the third character of `e`. If it's '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is now 1 ( incremented by 1). If it's '-', then `P` is 1 and `M` is now 2 (incremented by 1). If it's neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 0 and `M` is now 3 (incremented by 1). The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, minus one.
