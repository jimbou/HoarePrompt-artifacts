Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must not be empty, `i` is 4, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `q` is the first character in the string `e` and `q` is not '+'**

The code increments the value of `M` by 1. The initial state had `M` as 0, so after the increment, `M` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state still has `s` as an integer equal to the new input value, `e` as a string equal to the new input value that must not be empty, `i` as 4, `P` as 0, and `q` as the first character in the string `e` that is not '+'.
