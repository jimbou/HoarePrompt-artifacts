Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 3 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 4 and `M` is 0, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 4. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 3, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 4, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 4. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
