The only object in the loop head is variable  q and string e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e.  If the string has at least 5 characters the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 4 characters, q is the fourth character in the string e, i is 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string e must have at least 5 characters and the q is the fifth character in the string e.
State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is 3, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 3. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 4.**
