The code prints the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters in the string e. Since e is an empty string, it contains no '+' or '-' characters, so P and M are both 0. Therefore, the absolute difference is 0.
Output: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is an empty string, P is the number of '+' characters in the string e which is 0, M is the number of '-' characters in the string e which is 0, and the absolute difference between P and M which is 0 is being printed**
