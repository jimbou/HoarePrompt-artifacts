Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 3. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is now 2 and `M` remains 0. Otherwise, `P` is now 1 and `M` remains 1. The values of `s`, `e`, and `i` remain unchanged.
