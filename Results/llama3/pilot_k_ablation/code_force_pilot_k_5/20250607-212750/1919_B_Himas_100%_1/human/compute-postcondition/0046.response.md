Postcondition: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 3 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then either `P` is 4 and `M` is 0 with an absolute difference of 4, or `P` is 3 and `M` is 1 with an absolute difference of 2. If `q` is not '+', then either `P` is 1 and `M` is 3 with an absolute difference of 2, or `P` is 0 and `M` is 4 with an absolute difference of 4.**
