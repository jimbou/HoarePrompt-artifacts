The only variable in the loop head is variable q and string e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e. If the string e has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, e is a string that is not empty, q is the first character in the string e. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string e must have at least 2 characters and the q is the second character in the string e. If the second character in the string e is '+', then P is 1 and M is 0. Otherwise, P is 0 and M is 1.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 2 characters, q is the second character in the string e. If the second character in the string e is '+', then P is 1 and M is 0. Otherwise, P is 0 and M is 1.**
