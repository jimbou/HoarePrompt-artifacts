Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 2 characters, q is the second character in the string e. If the second character in the string e is '+', then P is 1 and M is 1. Otherwise, P is 0 and M is 2.**

In this output state, the value of M has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for P and M still depends on the second character of the string e. If the second character is '+', then P is 1 and M is now 1 (previously 0). If the second character is not '+', then P is 0 and M is now 2 (previously 1).
