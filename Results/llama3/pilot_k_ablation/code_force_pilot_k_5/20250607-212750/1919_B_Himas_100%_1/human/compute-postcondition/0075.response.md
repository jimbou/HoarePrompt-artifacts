Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 6 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 6, and if `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
