To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input value (since `int(input())` is the upper limit of the range).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The input value is not explicitly stated, but since `i` is 2, it means the input value must be at least 3 (since the range starts from 0).

So, at the start of the next iteration:

* `i` is 3
* The input value must be at least 3

The other variables `s`, `e`, `P`, and `M` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value, `i` is 3, `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is equal to the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+', and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the string `e` is being printed**
