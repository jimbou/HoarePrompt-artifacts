Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 5 characters, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If the fifth character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 5 and `M` is 0. If the fifth character in the string `e` is '-', then `P` is 4 and `M` is 1. If the fifth character in the string `e` is neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 2. If the fifth character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 4 and `M` is 1. If the fifth character in the string `e` is '-', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 2. If the fifth character in the string `e` is neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 3. If the fifth character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 2. If the fifth character in the string `e` is '-', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 3. If the fifth character in the string `e` is neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 4. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `P` has been incremented by 1, and the values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions for `P` and `M` based on the fifth character of the string `e` have been updated accordingly. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
