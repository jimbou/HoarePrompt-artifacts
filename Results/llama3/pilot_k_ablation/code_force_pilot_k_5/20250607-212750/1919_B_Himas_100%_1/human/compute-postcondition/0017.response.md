Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If the fourth character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 4 and `M` is 0. If the fourth character in the string `e` is '-', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 1. If the fourth character in the string `e` is neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 2. If the fourth character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 1. If the fourth character in the string `e` is '-', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 2. If the fourth character in the string `e` is neither '+' nor '-', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `P` and `M` based on the fourth character of the string `e` have been updated accordingly.
