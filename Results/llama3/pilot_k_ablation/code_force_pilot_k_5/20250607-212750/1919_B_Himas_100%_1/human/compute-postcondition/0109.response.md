Output State: **s is an integer equal to the new input value, e is a string equal to the new input value, i is 4, P is 0, M is 0**

The code snippet consists of four lines, each of which assigns a new value to a variable. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `s`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `e`. The third line assigns 0 to `P`, and the fourth line assigns 0 to `M`. 

The initial state of `s` and `e` is updated to the new input values. The values of `i`, `P`, and `M` are not affected by the code snippet. The absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the string `e` is not calculated or printed in this code snippet.
