Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 0 characters long, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 1, `i` is 1, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `q` is not equal to '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `M` being 1. The absolute difference between `P` and `M` is now 1, since `P` is still 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
