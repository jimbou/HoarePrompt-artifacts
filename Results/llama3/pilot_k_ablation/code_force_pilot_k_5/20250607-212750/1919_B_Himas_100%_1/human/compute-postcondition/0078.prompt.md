Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is an integer equal to the new input value, e is a string equal to the new input value, i is 2, P is 0, M is 0
Code of the loop:
for q in e:
    if q == '+':
        P += 1
    else:
        M += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s is an integer equal to the new input value, e is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 1 character, i is 2, q is the first character in the string e. If the first character in the string e is '+', then P is 1 and M is 0. Otherwise, P is 0 and M is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If the second character in the string `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If the third character in the string `e` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. If the third character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If the third character in the string `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 4 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 6 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 5. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 5 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
