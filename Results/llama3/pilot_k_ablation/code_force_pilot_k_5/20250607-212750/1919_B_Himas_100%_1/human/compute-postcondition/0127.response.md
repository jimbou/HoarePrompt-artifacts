Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the new input value with at least 3 characters, `i` is 4, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q`, and `M` has a value based on the value of `q`. Otherwise, `P` has a value based on the value of `q`, and `M` is increased by 1 from its previous value based on the value of `q`.***
