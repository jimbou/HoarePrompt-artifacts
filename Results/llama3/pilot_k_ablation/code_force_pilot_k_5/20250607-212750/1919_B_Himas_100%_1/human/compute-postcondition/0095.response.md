Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 3, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2 if `q` is '+', `P` is 0 and `M` is 3 if `q` is not '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` was initially 1 and is now 2. If `q` is not '+', then `M` was initially 2 and is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
