The only variable in the loop head is variable  q and string e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e. If the string e has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 2 characters, q is the second character in the string e, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string e must have at least 3 characters and the q is the third character in the string e.
State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 2 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2.**
