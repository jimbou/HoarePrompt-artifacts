Based on the precondition, the code will print the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of characters that are not '+' (`M`) in the string `e`.

Since `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` is the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+', the absolute difference between `P` and `M` represents the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string e**
