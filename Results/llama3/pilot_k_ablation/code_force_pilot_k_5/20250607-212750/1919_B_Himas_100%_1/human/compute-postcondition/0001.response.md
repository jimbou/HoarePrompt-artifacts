Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string, P is 0, M is 0**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `s`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by one. It then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `e`, further reducing the number of test cases in stdin. The variables `P` and `M` are initialized to 0. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
