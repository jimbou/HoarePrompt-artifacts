Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 5 characters, q is the fifth character in the string e. If the fifth character in the string e is '+', then P is 3 and M is 1. If the fifth character in the string e is '-', then P is 2 and M is 3. If the fifth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 1 and M is 4. If the fifth character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 3. If the fifth character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 4. If the fifth character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of M has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of M now depends on the fifth character of the string e. If the fifth character is '+', M is 1. If the fifth character is '-', M is 3. If the fifth character is neither '+' nor '-', M is 4. The other variables, including stdin, i, s, e, q, and P, remain unchanged.
