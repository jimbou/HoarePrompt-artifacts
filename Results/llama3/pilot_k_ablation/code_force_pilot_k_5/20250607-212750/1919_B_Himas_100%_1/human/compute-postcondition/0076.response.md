Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 5 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 6.**

The value of `M` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `M` depends on the value of `q`, which is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `M` was initially 0 and is now 1. If `q` is not '+', then `M` was initially 5 and is now 6. The values of the other variables are not affected.
