Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 2 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `P` and `M` based on the value of `q` are still valid, but the absolute difference between `P` and `M` has changed accordingly.
