Output State: **s is an integer equal to the new input value, e is a string equal to the new input value, i is 2, P is 0, M is 0**

The code first assigns a new integer value from the input to `s`, replacing its initial value. Then, it assigns a new string value from the input to `e`, replacing its initial value. The variables `P` and `M` are reset to 0, losing their initial values based on the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the original string `e`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2.
