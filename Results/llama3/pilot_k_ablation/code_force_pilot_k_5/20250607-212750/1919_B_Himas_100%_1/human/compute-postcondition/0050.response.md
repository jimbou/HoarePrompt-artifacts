Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 4 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then either `P` is 6 and `M` is 1 with an absolute difference of 5, or `P` is 5 and `M` is 2 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 5 and `M` is 2 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 4 and `M` is 3 with an absolute difference of 1. If `q` is not '+', then either `P` is 3 and `M` is 4 with an absolute difference of 1, or `P` is 2 and `M` is 5 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 2 and `M` is 5 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 1 and `M` is 6 with an absolute difference of 5.***
