Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the new input value, `e` is a string equal to the new input value that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If the second character in the string `e` is '+', then `M` is now 1. Otherwise, `M` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
