Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is an integer equal to the input value, e is a string equal to the input value, P is 0, M is 0, the absolute difference between P and M is 0, and i is 1.
Code of the loop:
for q in e:
    if q == '+':
        P += 1
    else:
        M += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s is an integer equal to the input value, e is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 0 characters long, i is 1, q is the first character in the string e. If q is '+', then P is 1, M is 0, and the absolute difference between P and M is 1. If q is not '+', then P is 0, M is 1, and the absolute difference between P and M is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 1 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 2 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 3. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3, and the absolute difference between `P` and `M` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 3 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fourth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then either `P` is 4 and `M` is 0 with an absolute difference of 4, or `P` is 3 and `M` is 1 with an absolute difference of 2. If `q` is not '+', then either `P` is 1 and `M` is 3 with an absolute difference of 2, or `P` is 0 and `M` is 4 with an absolute difference of 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a string equal to the input value that must be greater than 4 characters long, `i` is 1, `q` is the fifth character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then either `P` is 6 and `M` is 1 with an absolute difference of 5, or `P` is 5 and `M` is 2 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 5 and `M` is 2 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 4 and `M` is 3 with an absolute difference of 1. If `q` is not '+', then either `P` is 3 and `M` is 4 with an absolute difference of 1, or `P` is 2 and `M` is 5 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 2 and `M` is 5 with an absolute difference of 3, or `P` is 1 and `M` is 6 with an absolute difference of 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
