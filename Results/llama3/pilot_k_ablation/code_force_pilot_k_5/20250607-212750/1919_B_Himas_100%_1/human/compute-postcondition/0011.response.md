Postcondition: ***stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer, e is a string that must have at least 2 characters, q is the second character in the string e. If the second character in the string e is '+', then P is 2 and M is 0. Otherwise, if the second character in the string e is '-', then P is 1 and M is 1. If the second character in the string e is neither '+' nor '-', then P is 0 and M is 2.***
