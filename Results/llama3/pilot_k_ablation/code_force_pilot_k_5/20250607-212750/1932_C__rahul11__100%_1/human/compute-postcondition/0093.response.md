Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, l is n - 2 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is -1, r is 1 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values 1 and p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is a list containing the values 1 and p * arr[0] % m, p is p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is p * arr[0] % m, k is the second last character in the string, strr is the second last character in the string**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated based on the value of `l` and the corresponding element in the `arr` list. The value of `ans` has also been updated to include the new value of `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.
