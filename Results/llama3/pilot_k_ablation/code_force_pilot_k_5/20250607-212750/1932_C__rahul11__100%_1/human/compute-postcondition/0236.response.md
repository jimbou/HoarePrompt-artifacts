Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty. If the first character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and the first character in the string `s` is not 'L', k is the second character in the string.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If the first character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is now 2, otherwise, it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
