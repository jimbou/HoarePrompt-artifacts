Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The input is expected to contain an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The function processes each test case by iterating over the string s in reverse order, updating the product p by multiplying it with the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, and appending the updated product to the list ans. Finally, it prints the elements of the list ans in reverse order.**
