Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, p is 1, ans is an empty list**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign values to new variables. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable p. The second line assigns an empty list to the variable ans. Neither of these lines affects the values of the existing variables n, m, arr, s, l, r, or _. The stdin remains unchanged as well, still containing t - 1 test cases. The variable _ remains 0. The new variables p and ans are added to the state, with p being 1 and ans being an empty list.
