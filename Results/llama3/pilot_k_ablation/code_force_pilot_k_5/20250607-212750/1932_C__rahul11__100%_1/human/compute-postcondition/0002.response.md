According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and the k is the first character in the string.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, k is the first character in the string, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0**
