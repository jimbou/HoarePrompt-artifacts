Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, _, `k`, `ans`, `r`, and `p` are unchanged, `strr` is the second last character in the original string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', then `p` is `p` times `arr[r+1]` modulo `m`, and `r` is `r+1`. Otherwise, `l` is one less than its original value, and `p` is the product of its original value and the second last element of `arr` modulo `m`.***
