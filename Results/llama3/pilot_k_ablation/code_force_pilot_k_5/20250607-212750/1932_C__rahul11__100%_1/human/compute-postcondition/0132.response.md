Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `l` is 5 if the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 2, 3, or 4, `r` is `n` - 1 if the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the fourth character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is now 5, otherwise it is 2, 3, or 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
