Output State: **`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, _, `k`, `r`, `l`, and `strr` are unchanged, `p` is either `p` times `arr[r+1]` modulo `m` or the product of its original value and the second last element of `arr` modulo `m`, `ans` is the list containing the value of `p` appended to its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables except `ans` and `p` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`. If `strr` is 'R', then `p` is updated to be the product of its original value and `arr[r+1]` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `p` is updated to be the product of its original value and the second last element of `arr` modulo `m`. The list `ans` is updated by appending the updated value of `p` to its original value.
