Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, l is n - 1 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is n - 2 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is -1, r is 4 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 3 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 3 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 2, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values 1, p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m, and p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, and p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, p is p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise it is p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is p * arr[l] % m, k is the character before the current strr, strr is the third character in the string.**

The code increments the value of `r` by 1 and updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with the value of `arr[r]` and taking the modulus with `m`. The value of `r` is now 4 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 3 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 3 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 2. The value of `p` is now `p * arr[r] % m` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise it is `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is `p * arr[0] % m` if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is `p * arr[l] % m`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
