Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the current value of `p` has been appended to `ans` twice, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 0, `strr` is the second last character in the string. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `l` remains the same. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `r` remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `p` has been appended to the list `ans` again, resulting in `ans` containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R`, and the current value of `p` has been appended to `ans` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
