Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, k is the first character in the string. If k is 'L', then l is 1 and r is n - 1. Otherwise, l is 0 and r is n - 2. The stdin contains t - 1 test cases and _ is 0.**
