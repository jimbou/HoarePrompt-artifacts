The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order.

The `ans` list contains the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. The value of `p` is calculated as the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R'.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `m`, `strr`, and the initial value of `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `ans` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop in reverse order.

Output: **the values of p after each iteration of the loop in reverse order (where p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R')**
