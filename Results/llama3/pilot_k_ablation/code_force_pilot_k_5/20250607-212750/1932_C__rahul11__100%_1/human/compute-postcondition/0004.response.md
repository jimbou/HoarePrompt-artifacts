Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the first character in the string and is 'L', `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still has at least 1 character, and its first character `k` is still 'L'. The list `arr` and the integers `m`, `n`, and `r` are unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases, and the variable `_` is still 0.
