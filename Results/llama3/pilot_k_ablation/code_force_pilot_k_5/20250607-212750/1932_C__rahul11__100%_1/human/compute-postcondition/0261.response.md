Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus 1, p is the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index r modulo m, ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, stdin is empty, strr is the second last character of s.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
