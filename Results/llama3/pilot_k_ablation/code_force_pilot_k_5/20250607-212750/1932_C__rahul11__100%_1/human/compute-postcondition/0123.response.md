To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, and `k` is the first character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `k` must be the second character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is 1 if the second character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 0, `r` is `n` - 1 if the second character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the second character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**
