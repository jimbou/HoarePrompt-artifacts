Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t - 4 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop, `r` is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 2 if k is 'L', otherwise `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 1, `p` is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m, `k` is the second character in the string s, and `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The value of `l` now depends on whether `k` is 'L' or not. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` plus 2. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
