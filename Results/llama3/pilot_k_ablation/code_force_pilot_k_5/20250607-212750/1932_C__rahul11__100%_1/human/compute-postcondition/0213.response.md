Output State: **`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin`, `_`, `k`, `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m` if the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', otherwise `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m` if the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', otherwise `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
