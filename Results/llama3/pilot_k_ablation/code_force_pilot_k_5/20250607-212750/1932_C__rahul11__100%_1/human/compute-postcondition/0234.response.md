Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty. If the first character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and the first character in the string `s` is not 'L'.***
