Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 3, ans is an empty list, r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, p is the product of the current value of p and the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is p * arr[l] % m, k is the last character in the string s, and strr is the last character in the string s. If strr is 'R', then r is increased by 1. If strr is not 'R', then l is decreased by 1.**
