Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the second character in the string `s`, `stdin` is empty. If `k` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is unchanged and `r` is decreased by 1.***
