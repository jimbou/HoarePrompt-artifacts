Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus 1, p is the product of the original value of p, the value of arr at index r plus 1, and the value of arr at index r modulo m, ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p, the value of arr at index r plus 1, and the value of arr at index r modulo m and the value of p, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as an integer. The list of integers `arr` remains the same. The string `s` still has at least 3 characters. The value of `l` is still equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`. The value of `r` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus 1. The value of `p` has been updated to be the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. The list `ans` contains the updated value of `p` and the original value of `p`. The stdin remains empty.
