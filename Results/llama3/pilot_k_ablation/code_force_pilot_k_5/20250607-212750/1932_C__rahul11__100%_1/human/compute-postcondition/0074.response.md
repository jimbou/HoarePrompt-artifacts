Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `l` is 2 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is 1 if the fourth character is not 'L', otherwise it is 3, `r` is `n` - 2 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4 if the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 5, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and `k` is the fourth character in the string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. The value of `r` is now dependent on the first and second characters of the string `s` and the fourth character of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
