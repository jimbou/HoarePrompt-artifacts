Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least one character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the current value of `p`, and the current value of `p` has been appended to `ans`, stdin contains `t` - 3 test cases, `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the current value of `p` has been appended to the list `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
