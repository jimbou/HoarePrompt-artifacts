Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 12 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-2] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 4, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1. `p` is the value of `p * arr[r] % m * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`. `strr` is the third last character in the string `s`. `ans` contains an additional element which is the current value of `p`. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is the value of `p * arr[l] % m.**

The code appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. The value of `p` is determined by the third last character in the string `s`, which is stored in the variable `strr`. If `strr` is 'R', then `p` is the value of `p * arr[r] % m * arr[r] % m`, otherwise `p` is the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`. The list `ans` is printed in reverse order. The values of the other variables are not affected.
