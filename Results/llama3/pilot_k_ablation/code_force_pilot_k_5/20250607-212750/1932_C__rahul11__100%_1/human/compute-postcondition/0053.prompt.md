Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, p is 1, ans is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least one character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`, `p` is either equal to `p * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', or equal to the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least one character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least two characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R'. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1 and `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m`. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decremented by 1 and `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m`. `ans` has one more element which is the current value of `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least one character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the current value of `p`, and the current value of `p` has been appended to `ans`, stdin contains `t` - 3 test cases, `_` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the current value of `p` has been appended to `ans` twice, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 0, `strr` is the second last character in the string. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `l` remains the same. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `r` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
