Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is n - 1 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0, r is 0 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is n - 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values of p after each iteration of the loop, p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R', and the values of p after each iteration of the loop in reverse order are being printed, and k is the last character in the string.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the values of l and r have been updated accordingly based on the characters in the string s. If the string consists only of 'L's, l is set to n - 1, otherwise it is set to 0. If the string consists only of 'R's, r is set to 0, otherwise it is set to n - 1. The values of p after each iteration of the loop are stored in the list ans, and the values are being printed in reverse order. The variable k is set to the last character in the string s.
