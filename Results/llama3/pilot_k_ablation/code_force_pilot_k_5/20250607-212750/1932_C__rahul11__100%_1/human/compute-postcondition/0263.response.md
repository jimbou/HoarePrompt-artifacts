Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, p is the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, stdin is empty. If the second last character of s is 'R', then r is increased by 1. If the second last character of s is not 'R', then l is decreased by 1.***
