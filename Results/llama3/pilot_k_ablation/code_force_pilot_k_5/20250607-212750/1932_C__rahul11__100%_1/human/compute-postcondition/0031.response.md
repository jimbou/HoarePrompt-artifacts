Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least one character, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, ans is an empty list. If strr is 'R', then r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string plus 1, and p is equal to p * arr[r] % m. Otherwise, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string minus 1, and p is equal to the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m.***
