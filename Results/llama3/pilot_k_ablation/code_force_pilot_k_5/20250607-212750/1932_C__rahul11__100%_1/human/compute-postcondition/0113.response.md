The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order.

The `ans` list contains the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. Since the loop iterates `t - 2` times, the `ans` list will have `t - 1` elements (1 + `t - 2`).

The `[::-1]` slice notation reverses the order of the elements in the `ans` list.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order, starting from the last value of `p` (which is the last element of the `ans` list) and ending with the first element of the `ans` list, which is 1.

Output: **the elements of the ans list in reverse order, starting from the last value of p and ending with 1**
