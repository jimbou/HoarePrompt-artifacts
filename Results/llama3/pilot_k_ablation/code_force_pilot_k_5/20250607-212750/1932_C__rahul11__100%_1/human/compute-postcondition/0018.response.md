Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `k` is the fourth character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 4 and `r` is `n` - 2. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 5. The `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases and `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, regardless of whether `k` is 'L' or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
