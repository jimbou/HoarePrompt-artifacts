Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus 1, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, strr is the second last character in the string s, p is the product of the original value of p, the value of arr at index l, and the value of arr at index l modulo m, and ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p, the value of arr at index r plus 1, and the value of arr at index r modulo m and the value of p.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of its original value, the value of `arr` at index `l`, and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
