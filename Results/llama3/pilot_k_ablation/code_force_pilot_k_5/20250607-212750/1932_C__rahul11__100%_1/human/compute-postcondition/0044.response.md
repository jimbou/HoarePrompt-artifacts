Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least one character, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string plus 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 0, ans is a list containing the values of p and the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R', and the current value of p which is the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m.**

In this output state, the value of r has been incremented by 1, and the value of p has been updated to be the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
