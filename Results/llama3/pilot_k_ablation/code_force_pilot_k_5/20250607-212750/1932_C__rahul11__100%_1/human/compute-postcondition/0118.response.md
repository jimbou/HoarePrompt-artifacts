Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, the current value of `k` is 'L', and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.***
