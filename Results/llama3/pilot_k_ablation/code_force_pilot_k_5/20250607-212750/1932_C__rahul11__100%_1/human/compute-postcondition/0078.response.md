Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 5 characters, `l` is an integer that depends on the first two and fifth characters of the string `s` and is increased by 1, `r` is an integer that depends on the first two and fifth characters of the string `s`, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and `k` is the fifth character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 4 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is 3 if the fifth character is not 'L', otherwise it is 5, and `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 3 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is 2 if the fifth character is not 'L', otherwise it is 4, and `r` is `n` - 2 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4 if the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fifth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fifth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 5.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `l` has been increased by 1. The value of `l` now depends on the first two and fifth characters of the string `s`, and is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
