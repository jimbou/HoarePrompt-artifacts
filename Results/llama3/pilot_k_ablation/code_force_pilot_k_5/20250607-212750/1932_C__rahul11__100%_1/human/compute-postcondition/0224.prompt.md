Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 3, ans is an empty list, r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus the number of iterations of the loop, p is 1, k is the last character in the string s, and strr is the first character in the initial string.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`, `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`, `k` is the last character in the string `s`, and `strr` is the last character in the string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, `r`, `p`, `k`, and `strr` retain their initial values. `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `p` is updated to the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin`, `_`, `k`, `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m` if the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', otherwise `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 characters, stdin, _, `k` are unchanged. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. If the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decremented by 1, `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`, and `p` is updated to `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`. `ans` is appended with the value of `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, _, `k`, `r`, `l`, and `strr` are unchanged, `p` is either `p` times `arr[r+1]` modulo `m` or the product of its original value and the second last element of `arr` modulo `m`, `ans` is the list containing the value of `p` appended to its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
