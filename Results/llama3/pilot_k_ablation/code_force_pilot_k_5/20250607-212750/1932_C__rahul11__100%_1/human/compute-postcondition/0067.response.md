Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is 2 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L', otherwise it is 1, `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and `k` is the second character in the string.***
