State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty string, l is n - 1 if the initial string consisted of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0, r is n - 1 if the initial string consisted of only 'R's, otherwise it is n - 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of p after each iteration of the loop, p is the last value of p after the loop finishes, k is the first character in the initial string, strr is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of p after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**
