Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is `n - 1` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is `n - 2` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is -1, `r` is 3 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 2 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 2 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, `p * arr[r] % m` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise `p * arr[0] % m`, and `p * arr[r] % m` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise `p * arr[0] % m` if the current character is 'R', otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, `p` is `p * arr[r] % m` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise it is `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is `p * arr[0] % m` if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is `p * arr[l] % m`, `k` is the character before the current `strr`, `strr` is the character before the current `strr`.**
