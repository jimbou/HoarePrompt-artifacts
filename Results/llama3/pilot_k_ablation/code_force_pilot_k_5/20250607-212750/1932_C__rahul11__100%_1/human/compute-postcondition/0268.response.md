Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1, `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1, `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, and the value of `arr` at index `l`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, and the value of `p`. In both cases, stdin is empty.**
