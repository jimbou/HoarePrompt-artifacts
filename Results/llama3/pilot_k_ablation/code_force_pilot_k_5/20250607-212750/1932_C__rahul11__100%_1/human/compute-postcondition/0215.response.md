Output State: **n, m, arr, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin, _, k, l is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, ans is appended with the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if the second last character in the string s is not 'R', otherwise ans is appended with the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m, strr is the second last character in the string s, r is incremented by 1, p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been incremented by 1. The value of `p` has been updated to be the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. The value of `ans` has been appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', otherwise `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, `k`, `l`, and `strr` remain unchanged.
