Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t - 11 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-2] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and if `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 3, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2, and if `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1, and `p` is the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and `strr` is the second last character in the string `s`, and `ans` contains an additional element which is the current value of `p`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t - 11 test cases.
