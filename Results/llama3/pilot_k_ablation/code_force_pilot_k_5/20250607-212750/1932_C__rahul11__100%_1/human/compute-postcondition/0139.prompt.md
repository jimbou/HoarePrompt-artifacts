Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of p after each iteration of the loop, p is the last value of p after the loop finishes, k is the first character in the initial string, strr is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of p after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is 1 if the first character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 0, `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the first character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is 2 if the second character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 1, `r` is `n` - 1 if the second character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the second character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is 3 if the third character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 1 or 2, `r` is `n` - 1 if the third character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 or `n` - 3, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the third character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `l` is 4 or 5 if the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4 if the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, or `n` - 5, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the fourth character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: The program executes with the given precondition and after the if-else block, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `_`, `ans`, `p`, `k`, and `strr` are updated according to the conditions in the if and else parts. If the fifth character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is 6 or 7, and `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, or `n` - 5. Otherwise, `l` is 5 or 6, and `r` is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, `n` - 5, or `n` - 6. The list `ans` contains the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, and is printed in reverse order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
