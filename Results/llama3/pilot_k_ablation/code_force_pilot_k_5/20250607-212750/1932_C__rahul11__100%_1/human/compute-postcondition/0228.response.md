Output State: **n and m are integers, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin is empty**

The code block reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It then reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `arr`. The next line reads a string from the input and assigns it to `s`. The last two lines initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`. Since the input value has increased by 1, allowing the loop to execute one more time, the code block is able to read the additional input. After the code block executes, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, and `r` have been assigned values, and the input is empty.
