Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    p = 1
    ans = []
    for strr in s[::-1]:
        if strr == 'R':
            r += 1
            p = p * arr[r] % m
        else:
            l -= 1
            p = p * arr[l] % m
        ans.append(p)
    print(*ans[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is equal to 0, r is equal to n - 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, ans is a list containing the values of p after each iteration of the loop, p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R', and the values of p after each iteration of the loop in reverse order are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty string, l is n - 1 if the initial string consisted of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0, r is n - 1 if the initial string consisted of only 'R's, otherwise it is n - 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of p after each iteration of the loop, p is the last value of p after the loop finishes, k is the first character in the initial string, strr is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of p after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order, r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s, p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m, k is the last character in the string s, and strr is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The final state of the loop after all iterations have finished, and the elements of ans in reverse order are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is equal to 0, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, p is the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, stdin is empty, and the elements of the list ans are printed in reverse order




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
