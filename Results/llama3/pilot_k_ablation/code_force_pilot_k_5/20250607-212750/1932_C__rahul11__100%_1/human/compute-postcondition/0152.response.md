Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t - 7 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and r is r + 1 if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise l is l - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the value of `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and the values of `r` and `l` are updated based on the second last character in the string `s`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
