To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `k` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `k` is the third character in the string `s`.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 4 characters, and `k` must be the fourth character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `l` is 4 if the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 1, 2, or 3, `r` is `n` - 1 if the fourth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the fourth character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**
