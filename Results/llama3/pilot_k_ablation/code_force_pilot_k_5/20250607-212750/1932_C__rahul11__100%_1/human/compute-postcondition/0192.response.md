Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 5 characters, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, `_` is 4, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is the fifth character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` if `k` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` plus 5, `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R' and `k` is 'L', otherwise `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m` if `k` is 'L', otherwise `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r + 1` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
