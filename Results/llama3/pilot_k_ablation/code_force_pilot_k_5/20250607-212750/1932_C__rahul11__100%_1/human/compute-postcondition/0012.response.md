To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `s`. Since `k` is the second character in the string `s`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters. Therefore, `k` should be the third character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `k` is the third character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n` - 1. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 2. The `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases and `_` is 0.**
