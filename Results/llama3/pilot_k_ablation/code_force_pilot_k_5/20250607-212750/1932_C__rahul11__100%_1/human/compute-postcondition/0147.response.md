Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, _ is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the value of p, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the value of p is printed. If strr is 'R', then `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus 1, and `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 1, and `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t - 5` test cases. The value of `p` is updated based on the value of `strr` and the number of 'R' or 'L' characters in the string `s`.
