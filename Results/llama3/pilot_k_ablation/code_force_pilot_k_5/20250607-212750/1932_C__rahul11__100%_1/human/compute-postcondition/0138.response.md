Postcondition: **The program executes with the given precondition and after the if-else block, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `_`, `ans`, `p`, `k`, and `strr` are updated according to the conditions in the if and else parts. If the fifth character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is 6 or 7, and `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, or `n` - 5. Otherwise, `l` is 5 or 6, and `r` is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, `n` - 5, or `n` - 6. The list `ans` contains the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, and is printed in reverse order.**
