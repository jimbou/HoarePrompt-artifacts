Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values of p after each iteration of the loop, p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R', and the values of p after each iteration of the loop in reverse order are being printed
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is 1 if the first character in the string is 'L', otherwise it is 0, `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop in reverse order are being printed, `k` is the first character in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is 2 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L', otherwise it is 1, `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and `k` is the second character in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is 2 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the third character is 'L', otherwise it is 1 if the third character is not 'L', otherwise it is 3, `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the third character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the third character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the third character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the third character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the third character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the third character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the third character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and `k` is the third character in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `l` and `r` are integers that depend on the first two and fourth characters of the string `s`, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and `k` is the fourth character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 3 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is 2 if the fourth character is not 'L', otherwise it is 4, and `r` is `n` - 1 if the first character in the string is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is 'L' and the fourth character is not 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 3 if the first character is 'L' and the second character is not 'L' and the fourth character is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 4.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
