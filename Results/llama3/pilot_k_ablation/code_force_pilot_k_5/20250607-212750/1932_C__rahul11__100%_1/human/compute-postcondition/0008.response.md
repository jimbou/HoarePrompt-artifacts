To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `s` has at least one more character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, and `k` is the first character in the string. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `k` must be the second character in the string.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n` - 2. The `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases and `_` is 0.**
