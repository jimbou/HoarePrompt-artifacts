To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body (as indicated by the omission of the loop body). The loop also depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is not a variable that can be adjusted.

Given that the loop has finished all iterations, it means that the loop has exhausted the range generated by `int(input())`. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that the loop has not yet exhausted the range.

Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to adjust the state so that the loop has not yet finished all iterations.

The only way to do this is to assume that the input value has changed, allowing the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input value has increased.

State: **The input value has increased by 1, allowing the loop to execute one more time**
