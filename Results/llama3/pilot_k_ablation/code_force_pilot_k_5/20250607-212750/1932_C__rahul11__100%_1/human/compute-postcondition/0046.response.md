Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least one character, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string. If strr is 'R', then r is incremented by 1 and p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m. If strr is not 'R', then l is decremented by 1 and p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m. ans is a list containing the values of p and the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R', and the current value of p. stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 0.***
