State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 0 characters, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`, `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`, `k` is the second last character in the string `s`, and `strr` is the second last character in the string `s`.**
