Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus 1, and `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 1, and `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l`, and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `ans` now contains the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is updated based on the second last character of the string `s`. If the second last character is 'R', then `r` is calculated and `p` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `l` is calculated and `p` is updated accordingly.
