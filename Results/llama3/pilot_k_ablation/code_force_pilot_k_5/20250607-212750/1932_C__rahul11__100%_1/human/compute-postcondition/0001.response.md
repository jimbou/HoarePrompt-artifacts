Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0**

The code block reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by a list of integers `arr` and a string `s`. It then initializes two variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in the input is reduced by 1.
