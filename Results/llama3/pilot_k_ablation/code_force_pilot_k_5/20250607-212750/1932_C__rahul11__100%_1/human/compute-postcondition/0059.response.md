Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `stdin` contains `t` - 2 test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop in reverse order are being printed, `k` is the first character in the string and the current value of `k` is 'L'.**
