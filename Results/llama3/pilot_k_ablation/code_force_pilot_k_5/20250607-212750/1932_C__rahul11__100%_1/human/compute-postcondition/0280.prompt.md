Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, p is 1, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, `stdin` is empty, `strr` is the last character of `s`. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`, stdin is empty. If the second last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1. If the second last character of `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1, `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1, `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, and the value of `arr` at index `l`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, and the value of `p`. In both cases, stdin is empty and `ans` has one more element appended to it which is the value of `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus 1, and `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 1, and `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l`, and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus 1, `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p` and the value of `p`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 2, `p` is the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `l`, and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p`, the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1, and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p` and the value of `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
