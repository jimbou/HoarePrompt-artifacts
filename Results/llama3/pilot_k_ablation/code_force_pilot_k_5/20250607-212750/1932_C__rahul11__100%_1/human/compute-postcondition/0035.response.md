Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least one character, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string minus 1, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 0, ans is a list containing the value of p, p is equal to the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m, strr is the next character in the reversed string s**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
