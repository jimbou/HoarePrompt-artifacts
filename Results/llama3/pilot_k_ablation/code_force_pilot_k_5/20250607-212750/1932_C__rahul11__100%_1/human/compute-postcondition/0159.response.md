Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t - 10 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the second last character in the string s is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-2] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the second last character in the string s is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, and if the second last character in the string s is 'R', then r is increased by 3, otherwise l is decreased by 2, and strr is the second last character in the string s.**

The code block increments the value of `r` by 1, and then updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with the value of `arr[r]` and taking the modulus `m`. The value of `p` is now `p * arr[r+1] % m`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
