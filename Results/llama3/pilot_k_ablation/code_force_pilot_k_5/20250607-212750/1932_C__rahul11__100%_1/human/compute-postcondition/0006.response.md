Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, k is the first character in the string, l is 0, r is n - 2, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0. The first character of the string s is not 'L'.**

In this output state, the value of r has been updated to n - 2, which is one less than its initial value of n - 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the first character of the string s is not 'L' is still valid.
