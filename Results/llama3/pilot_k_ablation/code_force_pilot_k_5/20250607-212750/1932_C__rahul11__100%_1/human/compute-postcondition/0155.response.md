Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 8 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, and l is l - 2, and strr is the third last character in the string s.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to `p * arr[l-1] % m`. The list `ans` now contains the value 1, the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and is printed in reverse order. The value of `strr` remains the same, which is the third last character in the string `s`. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
