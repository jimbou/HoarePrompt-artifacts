Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 12 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string s is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-2] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string s is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if strr is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the list ans is printed in reverse order. If strr is 'R', then r is increased by 4, otherwise l is decreased by 2. If strr is not 'R', then l is decreased by 1. p is the value of p * arr[r] % m * arr[r] % m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is the value of p * arr[l-1] % m. strr is the third last character in the string s. ans contains an additional element which is the current value of p. If strr is not 'R', then l is decreased by 1 and p is the value of p * arr[l] % m.***
