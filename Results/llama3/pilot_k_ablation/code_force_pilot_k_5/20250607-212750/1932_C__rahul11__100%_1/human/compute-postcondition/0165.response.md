Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 12 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string s is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-2] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string s is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if strr is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, and if strr is 'R', then r is increased by 3, otherwise l is decreased by 2, and if strr is not 'R', then l is decreased by 1, and p is the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and strr is the third last character in the string s, and ans contains an additional element which is the current value of p, l is decreased by 1, and p is the value of p * arr[l] % m.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The code modifies the values of `l` and `p`. The value of `l` is decreased by 1, and the value of `p` is updated to be the result of `p * arr[l] % m`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` still contains the same elements, but an additional element is added, which is the current value of `p`. The string `s` still has at least 3 characters, and the value of `strr` is still the third last character in the string `s`. The value of `r` is still increased by 3 if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `l` is decreased by 2. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1. The value of `p` is still the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`. The list `ans` is still printed in reverse order.
