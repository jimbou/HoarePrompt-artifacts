Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `k` is the third character in the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is unchanged, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `r` is decreased by 1. The string `s` still has at least 3 characters, and `k` is still the third character in the string `s`. The stdin remains empty.
