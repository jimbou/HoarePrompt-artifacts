Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the first character is 'L', `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still has at least 1 character and its first character is still 'L'. The stdin is still empty.
