Output State: **`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, `r`, `p`, `k`, and `strr` retain their initial values. `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `p` is updated to the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables except `l`, `ans`, `r`, and `p` retain their initial values. The value of `l` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, depending on the value of `strr`. The list `ans` is appended with the current value of `p`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to the product of its current value and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `p` is updated to the product of its current value and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.
