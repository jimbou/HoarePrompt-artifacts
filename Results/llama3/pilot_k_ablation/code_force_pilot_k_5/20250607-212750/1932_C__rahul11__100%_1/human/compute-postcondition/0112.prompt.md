Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is n - 1 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0, r is 0 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is n - 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the value 1, p is 1, and k is the last character in the string.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is `n - 1` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0, `r` is 1 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and `p`, `p` is `p * arr[1] % m` if the last character in the string is 'R', otherwise it is `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is `p * arr[0] % m`, `k` is the last character in the string, `strr` is the last character in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is `n - 1` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is 0, `r` is 2 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, `p * arr[r] % m` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise `p * arr[0] % m`, and `p` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise `p * arr[0] % m`, `p` is `p * arr[r] % m` if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise it is `p * arr[n - 2] % m` if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is `p * arr[0] % m`, `k` is the second last character in the string, `strr` is the second last character in the string.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
