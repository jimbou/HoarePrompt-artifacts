Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t - 6 test cases, `_` is 2. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the value of p * arr[r] % m, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the value of p * arr[r] % m is printed, and r is r + 1. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the value of p * arr[l-1] % m is printed, and l is l - 1.***
