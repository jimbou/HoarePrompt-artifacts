Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin`, `_`, `k`, `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p`. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1 and `p` is multiplied by `arr[r]` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `r` retains its initial value, `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`, and `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.***
