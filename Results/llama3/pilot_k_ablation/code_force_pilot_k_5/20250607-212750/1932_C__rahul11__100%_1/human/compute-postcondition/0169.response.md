The code prints the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order. The list `ans` contains the value 1 and the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. The value of `p` is calculated based on the characters in the string `s` and the values in the list `arr`.

The initial value of `p` is not specified, but it is multiplied by the value of `arr` at index `r` (if the character is 'R') or `l` (if the character is 'L') modulo `m` in each iteration. The indices `r` and `l` are calculated based on the number of 'R' and 'L' characters in the string `s`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `m`, and `s` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `p` and the elements of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value 1 followed by the values of `p` in reverse order.

Output: **1, [p values in reverse order] (where p values are calculated based on the characters in the string s and the values in the list arr)**
