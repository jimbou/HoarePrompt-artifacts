Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m` and the value of `p`, stdin is empty. If the second last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1. If the second last character of `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `p`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
