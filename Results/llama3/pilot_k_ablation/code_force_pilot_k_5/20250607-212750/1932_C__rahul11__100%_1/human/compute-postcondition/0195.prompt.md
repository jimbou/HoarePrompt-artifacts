Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 3, ans is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order, r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s, p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m, k is the last character in the string s, and strr is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains t - 4 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop, `r` is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 1 if k is 'L', otherwise `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s, `p` is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m, `k` is the first character in the string s, and `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t - 4 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop, `r` is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 1 if k is 'L', otherwise `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s, `p` is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m, `k` is the second character in the string s, and `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order. If k is 'L', then `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 2. Otherwise, `r` is n - 2 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, and `p` is the value of p times the value of arr at index r + 1 modulo m if strr is 'R'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains t - 4 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop, `r` is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s if k is 'L', otherwise `r` is n - 2 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 2 if k is 'L', otherwise `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 1, `p` is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R' and k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m if k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r + 1 modulo m if strr is 'R', `k` is the third character in the string s, and `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 4 characters, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 3, ans is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop. If k is 'L', r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, otherwise r is n - 2 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s. If k is 'L', l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 3, otherwise l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 2. p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R' and k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m if k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r + 1 modulo m if strr is 'R'. k is the fourth character in the string s, and strr is the first character in the initial string. The list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 5 characters, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, _ is 4, ans is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop. If k is 'L', r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, otherwise r is n - 2 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s. If k is 'L', l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 4, otherwise l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 3. p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R' and k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m if k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r + 1 modulo m if strr is 'R'. k is the fifth character in the string s, and strr is the first character in the initial string. The list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
