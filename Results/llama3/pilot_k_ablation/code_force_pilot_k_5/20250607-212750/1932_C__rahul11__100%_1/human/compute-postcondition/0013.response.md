Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `k` is the third character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 3 and `r` is `n` - 1. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n` - 2. The `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases and `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is now 3, otherwise, it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
