Output State: **`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 characters, stdin, _, `k` are unchanged. If the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `l` is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. If the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decremented by 1, `ans` is appended with the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`, and `p` is updated to `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`. `ans` is appended with the value of `p`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated by appending the current value of `p`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the second last character of the string `s` still apply.
