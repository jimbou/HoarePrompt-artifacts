Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the last character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. The value of `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, and the value of `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`. The list `ans` contains the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, and is printed in reverse order. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
