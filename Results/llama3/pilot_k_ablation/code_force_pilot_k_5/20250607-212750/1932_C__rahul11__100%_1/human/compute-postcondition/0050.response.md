Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string minus 1, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, p is the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m, ans is a list containing the values of p and the product of the original value of p and the element at index r in arr modulo m if strr is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr modulo m if strr is not 'R', and the current value of p, and the current value of p has been appended to ans, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 0, strr is the second last character in the string**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m`. The list `ans` still contains the original values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R', and the current value of `p` has been appended to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
