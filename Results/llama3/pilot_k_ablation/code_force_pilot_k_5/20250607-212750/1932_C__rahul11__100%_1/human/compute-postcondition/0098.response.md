Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, l is n - 2 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is -1, r is 2 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values 1, p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m, and p * arr[l] % m, p is p * arr[l] % m, k is the character before the current strr, strr is the character before the current strr**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of the previous value of `p` and the element at index `l` in the list `arr`, modulo `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
