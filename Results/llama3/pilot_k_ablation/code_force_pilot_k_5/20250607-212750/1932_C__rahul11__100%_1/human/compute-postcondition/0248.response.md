Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `k` is the third character in the string `s`, `stdin` is empty, `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `k`, `stdin`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that the value of `l` is incremented by 1.
