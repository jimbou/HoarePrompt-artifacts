Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed. If strr is 'R', then r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus 1, and p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r plus 1 modulo m. Otherwise, l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus 1, and p is the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index l modulo m.***
