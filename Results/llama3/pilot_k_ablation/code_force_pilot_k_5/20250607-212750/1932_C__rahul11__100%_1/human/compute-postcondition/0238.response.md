Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty. If the first character in the string `s` is 'L', then if the second character `k` is 'L', `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`. If the first character in the string `s` is not 'L', then if the second character `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.***
