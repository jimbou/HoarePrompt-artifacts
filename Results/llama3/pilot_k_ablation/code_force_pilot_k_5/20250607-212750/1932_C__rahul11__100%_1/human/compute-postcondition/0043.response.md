State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least one character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `_` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` and the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R'. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1 and `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m`. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decremented by 1 and `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m`. `ans` has one more element which is the current value of `p`.**
