Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains t - 9 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-2] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 2, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2, and `strr` is the third last character in the string `s`.**

The value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `p`. The rest of the state remains the same.
