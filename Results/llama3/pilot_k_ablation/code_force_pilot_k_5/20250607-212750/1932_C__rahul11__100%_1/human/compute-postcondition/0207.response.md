Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, `ans`, `r`, `p`, `k`, and `strr` retain their initial values. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.**
