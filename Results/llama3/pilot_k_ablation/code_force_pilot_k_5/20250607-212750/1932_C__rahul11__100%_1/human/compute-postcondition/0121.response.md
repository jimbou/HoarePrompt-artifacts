Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 2, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the first character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order. Additionally, the first character in the string `s` is not 'L'.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was initially `n` - 1, its new value is `n` - 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
