Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 5 characters, `k` is the fifth character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 6 and `r` is `n` - 1. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 3 and `r` is `n` - 4. The `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases and `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is now 6, and if `k` is not 'L', then `l` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
