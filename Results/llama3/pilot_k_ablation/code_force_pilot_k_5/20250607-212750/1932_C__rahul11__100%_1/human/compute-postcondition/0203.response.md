Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, `_` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`, `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`, `k` is the last character in the string `s`, and `strr` is the last character in the string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` now contains the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p` * `arr[l]` % `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
