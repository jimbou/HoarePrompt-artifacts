Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is 3 if the third character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 2, `r` is `n` - 1 if the third character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the third character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1. If the third character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` becomes 3, otherwise it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
