Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, l is n - 2 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is -1 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is -2 if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise it is -3, r is 3 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 2 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 2 if the string consists of only 'R's, otherwise it is 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values 1, p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m, and p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, and p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's, otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, p is p * arr[l] % m, k is the character before the current strr, strr is the third character in the string.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of the previous value of `p` and the element at index `l` in the list `arr`, modulo `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `r`, `stdin`, `_`, `ans`, `k`, and `strr` remain unchanged.
