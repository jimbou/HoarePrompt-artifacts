Output State: **n is unchanged, m is unchanged, arr is unchanged, s is unchanged, stdin is unchanged, _ is unchanged, k is unchanged, l is decremented by 1, ans is appended with the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m if the second last character in the string s is not 'R', otherwise ans is appended with the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m, strr is unchanged, p is updated to p * arr[l] % m**

The code snippet modifies the values of `l` and `p`. The value of `l` is decremented by 1. The value of `p` is updated to be the result of the expression `p * arr[l] % m`, which is the product of the current value of `p` and the value of `arr` at the decremented index `l`, modulo `m`. The value of `ans` is appended with the result of the expression `p * arr[l] % m` if the second last character in the string `s` is not 'R', otherwise it is appended with the result of the expression `p * arr[r] % m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, `k`, and `strr` remain unchanged.
