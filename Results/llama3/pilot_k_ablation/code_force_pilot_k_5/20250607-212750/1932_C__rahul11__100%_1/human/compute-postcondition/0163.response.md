To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `s` and `strr`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `s` in reverse order. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `strr` is the second last character in the string `s`.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `strr` must be the third last character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 11 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-2] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and if `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 3, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2, and if `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1, and `p` is the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and `strr` is the third last character in the string `s`, and `ans` contains an additional element which is the current value of `p`.**
