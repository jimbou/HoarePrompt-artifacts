Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `p` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`, `stdin` is empty, `strr` is the last character of `s`. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `stdin`, and `strr` remain the same. The list `ans` now contains the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` or `r` modulo `m`. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.
