Output State: **n, m, arr, s, stdin, _, k, ans, r are unchanged, l is one less than its original value, p is the product of its original value and the second last element of arr modulo m, and strr is the second last character in the original string s.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, `k`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `l` is decremented by 1, so it is one less than its original value. The value of `p` is updated to be the product of its original value and the second last element of `arr` modulo `m`. The value of `strr` remains the same as it is not modified by the code and is still the second last character in the original string `s`.
