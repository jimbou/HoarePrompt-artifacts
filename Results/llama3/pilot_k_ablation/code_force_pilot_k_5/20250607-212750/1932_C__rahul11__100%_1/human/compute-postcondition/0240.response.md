Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the second character in the string `s`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is unchanged, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `l` is incremented by 1. The string `s` still has at least 1 character, and `k` is still the second character in the string `s`. The `stdin` remains empty.
