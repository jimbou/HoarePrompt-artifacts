Postcondition: ***n, m, arr, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin, _, k are unchanged. If the second last character in the string s is 'R', then l is either decremented by 1 or retains its initial value, ans is appended with the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m, r is incremented by 1, and p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m. If the second last character in the string s is not 'R', then l is decremented by 1, ans is appended with the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m, and p is updated to p * arr[l] % m.***
