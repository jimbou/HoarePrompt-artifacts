Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the second character in the string is 'R', then l is n - 1 if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise it is 0 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is n - 2 if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise it is -1, and r is 5 if the string consists of only 'R's and the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 4 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 4 if the string consists of only 'R's and the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 3. Otherwise, l is n - 2 if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise it is -1 if the current character is 'L', otherwise it is -1 if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise it is -2, and r is 4 if the string consists of only 'R's and the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 3 if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 3 if the string consists of only 'R's and the current character is 'R', otherwise it is 2. In both cases, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the values 1, p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R' and the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise p * arr[0] % m, and p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R' and the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, and p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R' and the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R' and the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise p * arr[l] % m, k is the character before the current string, strr is the second character in the string, and p is p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string is 'R' and the current character is 'R', otherwise it is p * arr[n - 2] % m if the string consists of only 'L's and the current character is 'L', otherwise it is p * arr[0] % m if the current character is 'R', otherwise it is p * arr[l] % m.
