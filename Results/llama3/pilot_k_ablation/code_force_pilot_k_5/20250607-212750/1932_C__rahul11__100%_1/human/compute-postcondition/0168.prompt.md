Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s, r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 2, ans is a list containing the value 1, p is 1, k is the last character in the string s, strr is the first character in the initial string, and the list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, _ is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1 and the value of p, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the value of p is printed. If strr is 'R', then `r` is `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s` plus 1, and `p` is the value of `p` times the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 1, and `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t - 7 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r] % m if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and r is r + 1 if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise l is l - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains t - 9 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-2] % m, and the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of p * arr[l-1] % m, and the value of p, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 2, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2, and `strr` is the third last character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t - 11 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-2] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the second last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, and if `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 3, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2, and if `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1, and `p` is the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and `strr` is the second last character in the string `s`, and `ans` contains an additional element which is the current value of `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t - 12 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-2] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if the third last character in the string `s` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 4, otherwise `l` is decreased by 2. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1. `p` is the value of `p * arr[r] % m * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is the value of `p * arr[l-1] % m`. `strr` is the third last character in the string `s`. `ans` contains an additional element which is the current value of `p`. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is the value of `p * arr[l] % m.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
