Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty. If the first character in the string `s` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 3`, and the first character in the string `s` is not 'L', k is the second character in the string.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `l` is still 1 and `r` is now `n - 2`. If the first character of `s` is not 'L', then `l` is still 0 and `r` is now `n - 3`. The value of `k` is still the second character in the string `s`.
