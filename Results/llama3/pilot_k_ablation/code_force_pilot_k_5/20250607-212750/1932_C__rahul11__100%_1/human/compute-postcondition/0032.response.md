Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least one character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in the string, `r` is equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`, `p` is either equal to `p * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', or equal to the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if `strr` is not 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`. The value of `p` depends on the value of `strr`. If `strr` is 'R', then `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m`. If `strr` is not 'R', then `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
