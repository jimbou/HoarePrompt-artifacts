Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 4 characters, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, _ is 3, ans is a list containing the value 1 and the values of p after each iteration of the loop. If k is 'L', r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s, otherwise r is n - 2 minus the number of 'R' characters in the string s plus the number of 'R' characters in the string s. If k is 'L', l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 3, otherwise l is the number of 'L' characters in the string s minus the number of 'L' characters in the string s plus 2. p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r modulo m if strr is 'R' and k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index l modulo m if k is 'L', otherwise p is the value of p times the value of arr at index r + 1 modulo m if strr is 'R'. k is the fourth character in the string s, and strr is the first character in the initial string. The list ans is printed in reverse order, i.e., the value 1 is printed and then the values of p are printed in reverse order.***
