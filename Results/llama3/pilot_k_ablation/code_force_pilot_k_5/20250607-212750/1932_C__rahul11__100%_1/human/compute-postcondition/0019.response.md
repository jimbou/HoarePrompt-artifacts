Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `k` is the fourth character in the string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 5 and `r` is `n` - 1. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n` - 4. The `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases and `_` is 0***
