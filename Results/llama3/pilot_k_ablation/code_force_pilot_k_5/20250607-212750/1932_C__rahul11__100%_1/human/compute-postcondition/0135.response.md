State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 5 characters, `l` is 5 or 6 if the fifth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, or `n` - 5 if the fifth character in the string `s` is 'L', otherwise it is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, `n` - 4, `n` - 5, or `n` - 6, stdin contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `p` is the last value of `p` after the loop finishes, `k` is the fifth character in the string `s`, `strr` is the first character in the initial string, and the list `ans` is printed in reverse order, i.e., the values 1 and all the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop are printed in reverse order.**
