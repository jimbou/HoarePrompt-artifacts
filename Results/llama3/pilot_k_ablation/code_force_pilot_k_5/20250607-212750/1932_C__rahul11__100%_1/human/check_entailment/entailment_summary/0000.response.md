Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of the array, the value to take the remainder by, the array elements, and the string of commands.
2.  It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.
3.  It iterates over the string of commands in reverse order. For each command, it updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the value of the array at the corresponding index (`l` or `r`) modulo `m`.
4.  It appends the updated product to the list `ans`.
5.  Finally, it prints the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, which represents the remainders of the product of the array elements at each step.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
