Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which consists of an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

2. The program correctly initializes the variables n, m, arr, s, l, r, p, and ans.

3. The program correctly calculates the initial value of r, which is the index of the rightmost element in the array arr that will be processed.

4. The program correctly processes each test case by iterating over the string s in reverse order. For each character in the string s, it updates the product p by multiplying it with the value of arr at index l or r modulo m, and appends the updated product to the list ans.

5. The program correctly prints the elements of the list ans in reverse order, which is the desired output.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the string s contains only 'L' characters or only 'R' characters.

7. The program correctly handles the case where the array arr contains only one element.

8. The program correctly handles the case where the value of m is 1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
