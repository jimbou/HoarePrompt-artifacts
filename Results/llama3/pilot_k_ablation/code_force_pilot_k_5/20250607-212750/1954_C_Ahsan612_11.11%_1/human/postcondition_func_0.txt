This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by 2t lines, each containing two integers x and y. It then processes each pair of integers by comparing their corresponding digits and printing the maximum and minimum values for the first half of the digits and the minimum and maximum values for the second half of the digits. The function repeats this process t times, printing the results as strings.
