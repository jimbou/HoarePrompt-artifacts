Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of None values with the same length as a, new2 is a list of None values with the same length as a, mid is half the length of a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string
Code of the loop:
while i < mid:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first element is the maximum value between the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first element is the minimum value between the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 0, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the maximum values between the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the minimum values between the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the maximum values between the first three elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the minimum values between the first three elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 2, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the maximum values between the first four elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the minimum values between the first four elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 3, i is 4, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first five elements are the maximum values between the first five elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first five elements are the minimum values between the first five elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is greater than 4, i is 5, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
