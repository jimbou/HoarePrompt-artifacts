Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must not be empty, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the maximum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the minimum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The list `a` remains unchanged, containing the digits from the first input line.
* The list `b` remains unchanged, containing the digits from the second input line.
* The list `new` will have its first `mid` elements (where `mid` is half the length of `a`) set to the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The remaining elements in `new` will be `None`.
* The list `new2` will have its first `mid` elements set to the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The remaining elements in `new2` will be `None`.
* The variable `mid` remains unchanged, representing half the length of `a`.
* The variable `i` will be equal to `mid`, indicating that the loop has executed `mid` times.
* The `stdin` variable remains unchanged, containing `2t - 2` lines, each with an integer `x` and an integer `y`.
* The variable `_` remains unchanged, with a value of `0`.
