The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than the length of a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is mid + 3, a has a length greater than mid + 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of a needs to be greater than mid + 3.
State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 3, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 3, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**
