Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than mid+4, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+5 elements are the minimum values between the first mid+5 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+5 elements are the maximum values between the first mid+5 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid+5, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the `new` and `new2` lists have been updated with the minimum and maximum values between the elements of `a` and `b` at index `i`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
