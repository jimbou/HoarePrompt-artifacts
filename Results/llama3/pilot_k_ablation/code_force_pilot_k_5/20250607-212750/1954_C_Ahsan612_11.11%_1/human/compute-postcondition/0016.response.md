Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must have more than mid + 1 elements, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the maximum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None except for the mid-th element which is the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], and the (mid+1)th element which is the minimum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the minimum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None except for the mid-th element which is the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], and the (mid+1)th element which is the maximum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**

The code modifies the lists `new` and `new2` by assigning the minimum and maximum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the `(mid+1)`th elements of `new` and `new2` respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
