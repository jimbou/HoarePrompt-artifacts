Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 4, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], the maximum of a[2] and b[2], and the maximum of a[3] and b[3] respectively, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to 4, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], the minimum of a[2] and b[2], and the minimum of a[3] and b[3] respectively, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to 4, mid is greater than 4, i is 5, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1**

In this output state, the lists `new` and `new2` have been updated to include the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` for indices greater than or equal to 4, respectively. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
