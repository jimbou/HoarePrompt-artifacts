Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.**

The loop will execute until `i` is no longer less than `mid`, which is half the length of `a`. After the loop finishes executing, `new` will contain the maximum values of the first half of the elements of `a` and `b`, and `new2` will contain the minimum values of the first half of the elements of `a` and `b`. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` will remain `None`. The values of `mid`, `stdin`, `_`, and the printed strings will remain unchanged.
