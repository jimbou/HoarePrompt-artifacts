Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing an integer x (1 <= x < 10^100) and an integer y (1 <= y < 10^100), where x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    mid = len(a) // 2
    i = 0
    while i < mid:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    while i < len(a):
        new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must have at least len(a) elements, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] respectively, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is len(a), stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0, and the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for all i are printed, and this is printed: a string of digits, where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits in the lists a and b

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], mid is half the length of a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1, and the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with each element being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with each element being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where all the elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where all the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
