To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, the loop will execute if the input from `stdin` is a valid integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to contain a valid integer `t` and the variable `_` to be 0 (since it's the first iteration).

State: **`stdin` contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing an integer x (1 <= x < 10^100) and an integer y (1 <= y < 10^100), where x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `_` is 0**
