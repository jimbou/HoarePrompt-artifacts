Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 1, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+1 elements are the minimum values between the first mid+1 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+1 elements are the maximum values between the first mid+1 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid+1, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

In this final state, the values of `new` and `new2` have been updated to include the minimum and maximum values between the first `mid+1` elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it `mid+1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
