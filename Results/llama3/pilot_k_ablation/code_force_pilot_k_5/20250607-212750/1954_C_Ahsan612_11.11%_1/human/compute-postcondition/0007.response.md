Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must not be empty, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], and the maximum of a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], and the minimum of a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and mid must be greater than 2, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 4 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `new` and `new2` at index `i` (which is 2) with the maximum and minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively. It then increments `i` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The length of `a` is still greater than 4 (since `mid` is half the length of `a` and `mid` is greater than 2), and `stdin` still contains `2t - 4` lines.
