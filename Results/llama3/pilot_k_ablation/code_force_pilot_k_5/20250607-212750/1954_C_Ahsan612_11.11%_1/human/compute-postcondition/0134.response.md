Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than half the length of a plus four, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, except for the element at index i which is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, except for the element at index i which is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus five, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed**

In this final state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `new[i]` and `new2[i]` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
