The `print` statement is printing a string that is created by joining the elements of the `new` list. The `new` list contains the minimum of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`. 

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the elements in `new`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of digits, where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits in `a` and `b`.

Output: **a string of digits where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits in lists a and b**
