The only variable in the loop head is variable i and len(a), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and len(a).  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is mid + 2, and a must have more than mid + 1 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, a must have more than mid + 2 elements.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must have more than mid + 2 elements, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the maximum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None except for the mid-th element which is the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], and the (mid+1)th element which is the minimum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the minimum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None except for the mid-th element which is the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], and the (mid+1)th element which is the maximum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**
