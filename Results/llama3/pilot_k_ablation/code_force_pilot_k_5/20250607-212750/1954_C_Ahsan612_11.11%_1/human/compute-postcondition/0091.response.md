Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length of at least 2, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first three elements being the maximum of the first three elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, new2 is a list of values with the first three elements being the minimum of the first three elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, mid is greater than 2, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**

The code modifies the lists `new` and `new2` by assigning the maximum and minimum values of the elements at index `i` from lists `a` and `b` respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
