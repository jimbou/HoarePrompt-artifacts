The only variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid.  If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, mid is half the length of a, and a has a length greater than 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, mid must be greater than 2.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 4, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the maximum and minimum of a[0] and b[0] and a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the minimum and maximum of a[0] and b[0] and a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and mid is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1**
