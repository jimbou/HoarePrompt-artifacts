Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the maximum values between the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the minimum values between the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

In this output state, the values of `new` and `new2` have been updated to include the maximum and minimum values between the first two elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
