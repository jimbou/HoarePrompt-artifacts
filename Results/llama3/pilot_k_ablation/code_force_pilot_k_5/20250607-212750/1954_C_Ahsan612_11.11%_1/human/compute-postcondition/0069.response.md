The only variable in the loop head is variable i and len(a), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and len(a). If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is mid and mid is half the length of a. So for the loop to execute the first time, mid must be less than the length of a. Since mid is half the length of a, the length of a must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 1, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the maximum values between the first mid elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the minimum values between the first mid elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**
