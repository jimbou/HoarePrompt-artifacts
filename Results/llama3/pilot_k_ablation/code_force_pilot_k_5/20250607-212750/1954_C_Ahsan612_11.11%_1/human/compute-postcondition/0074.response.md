Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than mid+2, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+3 elements are the minimum values between the first mid+3 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+3 elements are the maximum values between the first mid+3 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid+3, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first `mid+2` elements of `new` and `new2` were already set to the minimum and maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The code has now set the `mid+3`rd element of `new` and `new2` to the minimum and maximum values between the `mid+3`rd elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `mid+3`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
