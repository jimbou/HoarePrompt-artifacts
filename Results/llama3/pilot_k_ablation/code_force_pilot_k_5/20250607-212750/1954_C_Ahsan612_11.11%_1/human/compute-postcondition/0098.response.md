Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the element at index i which is the minimum of the elements at index i of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the element at index i which is the maximum of the elements at index i of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `mid`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `mid + 1`. The lists `new` and `new2` are modified at index `i`, where `new[i]` is assigned the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `new2[i]` is assigned the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing 2t - 13 lines, each with an integer x and an integer y.
