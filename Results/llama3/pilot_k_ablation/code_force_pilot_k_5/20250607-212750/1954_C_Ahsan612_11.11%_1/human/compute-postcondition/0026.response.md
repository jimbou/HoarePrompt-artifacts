The code prints a string of digits, where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits in the lists `a` and `b`.

Since `new2` is a list of values with the same length as `a`, where all elements are the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively, the `print` statement will output a string of digits, where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits in the lists `a` and `b`.

Output: **the maximum of corresponding digits in lists a and b**
