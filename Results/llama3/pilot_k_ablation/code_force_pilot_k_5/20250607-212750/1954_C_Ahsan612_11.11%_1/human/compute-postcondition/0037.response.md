Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 4, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], the maximum of a[2] and b[2], and the maximum of a[3] and b[3] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], the minimum of a[2] and b[2], and the minimum of a[3] and b[3] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and mid is greater than 3, i is 4, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1**

The code modifies the lists `new` and `new2` by updating their fourth elements to be the maximum and minimum of `a[3]` and `b[3]` respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it 4. No other variables are affected.
