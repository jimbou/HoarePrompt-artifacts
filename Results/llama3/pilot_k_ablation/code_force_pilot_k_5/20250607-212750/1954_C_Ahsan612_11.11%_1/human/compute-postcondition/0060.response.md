The only variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid.  If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time mid must be greater than 1.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first element is the maximum value between the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first element is the minimum value between the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**
