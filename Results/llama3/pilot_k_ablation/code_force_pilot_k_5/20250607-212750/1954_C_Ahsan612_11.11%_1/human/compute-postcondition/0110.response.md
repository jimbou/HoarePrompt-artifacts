The code prints a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b`. The lists `a` and `b` contain digits from the second and third input lines, respectively. The `new2` list contains the maximum values of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, which are then converted to strings and joined together to form the output string.

Output: **a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of the lists a and b**
