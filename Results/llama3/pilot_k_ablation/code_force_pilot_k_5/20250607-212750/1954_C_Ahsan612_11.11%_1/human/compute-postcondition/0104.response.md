Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 3, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 4, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**

The code modifies the values of `new` and `new2` at index `i` and increments `i` by 1. The value of `new` at index `i` becomes the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the value of `new2` at index `i` becomes the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `mid + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
