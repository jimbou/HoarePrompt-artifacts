Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 2, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 3, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**

The code modifies the values of `new[i]`, `new2[i]`, and `i`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. The second line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it `mid + 3`. No other variables are affected.
