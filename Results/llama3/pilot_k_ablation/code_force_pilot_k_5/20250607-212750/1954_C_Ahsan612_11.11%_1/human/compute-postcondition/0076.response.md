Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than mid+3, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+4 elements are the minimum values between the first mid+4 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+4 elements are the maximum values between the first mid+4 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid+4, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

In this final state, the code has modified the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first `mid+4` elements of `new` and `new2` now contain the minimum and maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it `mid+4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
