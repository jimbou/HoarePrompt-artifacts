Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the maximum values between the first three elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the minimum values between the first three elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and must be greater than 2, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

The code modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`, where `i` is 2. The second line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`, where `i` is 2. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
