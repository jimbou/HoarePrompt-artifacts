According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `mid` is greater than 3. `mid` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `mid` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the maximum values between the first four elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the minimum values between the first four elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is greater than 4, i is 4, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**
