The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a.  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is mid+3 and a has a length greater than mid+2. For the loop to be executed one more time, a must have a length greater than mid+3.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than mid+3, b is a list of digits from the first input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+3 elements are the minimum values between the first mid+3 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid+3 elements are the maximum values between the first mid+3 elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid+3, stdin contains 2t - 9 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 2, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**
