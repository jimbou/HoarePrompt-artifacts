Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 1, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, except for the mid index which is the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, except for the mid index which is the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus one, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than i + 1, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus two, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than half the length of a plus two, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus three, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than half the length of a plus three, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, except for the element at index i which is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, except for the element at index i which is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus four, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than half the length of a plus four, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, except for the element at index i which is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the first half of the elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for the mid index and beyond, except for the element at index i which is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus five, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
