Output State: **a is a list of digits from the last input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the last input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where all elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], mid is half the length of a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 0 lines, _ is t - 1, and the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is printed as a string.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables a and b will contain the digits from the last two input lines, new and new2 will contain the minimum and maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b, mid will be half the length of a, i will be equal to the length of a, stdin will be empty, and _ will be t - 1. Additionally, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b will be printed as strings.
