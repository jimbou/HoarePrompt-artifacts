The code prints a string of digits, where each digit is the maximum value between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`. The string is created by iterating over the list `new2`, which contains the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and converting each value to a string using the `str()` function. The resulting strings are then joined together into a single string using the `''.join()` method.

Output: **the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b as a string**
