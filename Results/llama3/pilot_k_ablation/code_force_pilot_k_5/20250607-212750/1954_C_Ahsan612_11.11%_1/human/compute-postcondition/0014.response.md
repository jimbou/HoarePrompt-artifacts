Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must have more than mid elements, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the maximum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None except for the mid-th element which is the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first mid elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], ..., the minimum of a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest are None except for the mid-th element which is the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**

In this output state, the first line of the code assigns the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`, and the second line assigns the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. Since `i` is `mid`, this means that the `mid-th` element of `new` is now the minimum of `a[mid]` and `b[mid]`, and the `mid-th` element of `new2` is now the maximum of `a[mid]` and `b[mid]`. The third line increments `i` by 1, so `i` is now `mid + 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
