The variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid.  If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, mid is half the length of a, and a has a length of at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time mid must be greater than 1.
State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length of at least 4, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.**
