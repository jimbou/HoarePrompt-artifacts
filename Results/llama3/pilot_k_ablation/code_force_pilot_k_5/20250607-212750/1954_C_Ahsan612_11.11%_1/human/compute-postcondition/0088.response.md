The variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid. If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, mid is half the length of a, and a has a length of at least 2. mid being half the length of a does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to mid is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length of at least 2, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first element being the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest being None, new2 is a list of values with the first element being the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest being None, mid is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**
