To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2, and `int(input())` is not specified, but it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, `b` is a list of digits from the first input line, `new` is a list of values with the same length as `a`, where all elements are the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of values with the same length as `a`, where all elements are the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `mid` is half the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `stdin` contains 2t - 11 lines, each containing an integer `x` and an integer `y`, `_` is 3, the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is printed as a string, and the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is printed as a string, and the list of maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is printed as a string**
