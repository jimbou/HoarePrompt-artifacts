Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of None values with the same length as a, new2 is a list of None values with the same length as a, mid is half the length of a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**

In this output state, the variables a and b have been assigned lists of digits from the first two input lines, respectively. The variables new and new2 have been initialized as lists of None values with the same length as a. The variable mid has been calculated as half the length of a, and the variable i has been set to 0. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines, each with an integer x and an integer y. The variable _ remains unchanged at 0.
