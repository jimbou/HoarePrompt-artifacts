The code prints a string of digits, where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits in the lists `a` and `b`. The lists `a` and `b` are lists of digits from the first and second input lines, respectively. The length of `a` is greater than 0, and the length of `b` is the same as the length of `a`. The `new2` list contains the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.

Output: **the string of maximum digits between corresponding elements of a and b**
