Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length of at least 4, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the maximum of the first four elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the minimum of the first four elements of a and b respectively, and the rest are None, mid is greater than 3, i is 4, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.**

The code modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`, where `i` is 3. The second line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`, where `i` is 3. The third line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 4. No other variables are affected.
