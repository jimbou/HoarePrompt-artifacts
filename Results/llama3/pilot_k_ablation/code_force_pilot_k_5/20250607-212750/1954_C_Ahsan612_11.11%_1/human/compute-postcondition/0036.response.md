The only variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid.  If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3 and mid is greater than 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time mid needed to have been greater than 3.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 4, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], and the maximum of a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first three elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], and the minimum of a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and mid is greater than 3, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1**
