Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, mid is half the length of a, i is mid, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the element at index i which is the minimum of the elements at index i of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the element at index i which is the maximum of the elements at index i of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 1, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 2, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 2, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 3, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 3, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 4, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than mid + 4, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first mid elements being the maximum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the minimum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, new2 is a list of values with the first mid elements being the minimum of the first mid elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, except for the elements at indices i and i+1 which are the maximum of the elements at indices i and i+1 of a and b respectively, mid is half the length of a, i is mid + 5, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
