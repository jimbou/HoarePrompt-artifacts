Based on the precondition, the code prints the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` as a string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `new` is a list of values with the same length as `a`, where all elements are the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. This means that for each index `i`, `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
* The `print` statement uses a generator expression to convert each element `x` in `new` to a string using `str(x)`.
* The `join` method is used to concatenate these strings into a single string, with no separator (since the separator is an empty string `''`).

Therefore, the output will be a string representation of the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.

Output: **the list of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b as a string**
