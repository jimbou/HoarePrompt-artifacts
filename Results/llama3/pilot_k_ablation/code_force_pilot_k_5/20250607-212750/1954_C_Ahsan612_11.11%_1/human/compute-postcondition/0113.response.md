Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of None values with the same length as a, new2 is a list of None values with the same length as a, mid is half the length of a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 16 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 4, a string of the minimum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b is being printed.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The code reads two lines of input, assigning the digits from the second line to `a` and the digits from the third line to `b`. It then initializes two lists, `new` and `new2`, with the same length as `a`, but fills them with `None` values. The variable `mid` is set to half the length of `a`, and `i` is set to 0. The stdin still contains 2t - 16 lines of input, each with two integers. The value of `_` remains 4. The code also prints two strings: one containing the minimum values of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and another containing the maximum values of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
