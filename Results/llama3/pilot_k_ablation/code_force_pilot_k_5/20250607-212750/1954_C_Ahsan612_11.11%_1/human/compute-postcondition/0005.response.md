Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and a must not be empty, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0] and the maximum of a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first two elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0] and the minimum of a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is half the length of a and mid must be greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 4 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 0**

In this output state, the first two elements of the lists `new` and `new2` have been updated to the maximum and minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, and the number of lines in stdin has been reduced by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
