Output State: **a is a list of digits from the second input line with a length of at least 2, b is a list of digits from the third input line, new is a list of values with the first four elements being the maximum of the first four elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, new2 is a list of values with the first four elements being the minimum of the first four elements of a and b respectively, and the rest being None, mid is greater than 3, i is 4, stdin contains 2t - 13 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 3**

The code executes three lines. The first line assigns the maximum value between the fourth elements of `a` and `b` to the fourth element of `new`. The second line assigns the minimum value between the fourth elements of `a` and `b` to the fourth element of `new2`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it equal to 4. No other variables are affected.
