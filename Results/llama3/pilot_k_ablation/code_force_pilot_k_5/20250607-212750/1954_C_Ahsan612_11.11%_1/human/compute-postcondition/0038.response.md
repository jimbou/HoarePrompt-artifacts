According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `mid` is greater than 3. `mid` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `mid` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 4, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the maximum of a[0] and b[0], the minimum of a[1] and b[1], the maximum of a[2] and b[2], and the maximum of a[3] and b[3] respectively, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first four elements are the minimum of a[0] and b[0], the maximum of a[1] and b[1], the minimum of a[2] and b[2], and the minimum of a[3] and b[3] respectively, and the rest are None, mid is greater than 4, i is 4, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1**
