Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length greater than 0, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to half the length of a, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to half the length of a, mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length of at least 2, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, the element at index i is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than half the length of a, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, the element at index i is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to half the length of a, mid is half the length of a, i is half the length of a plus 1, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length of at least i+1, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, the element at index i is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], the element at index i+1 is the minimum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than half the length of a, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, the element at index i is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], the element at index i+1 is the maximum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to half the length of a, mid is half the length of a, i is less than the length of a and is two more than its original value, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line with a length of at least i+2, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, the element at index i is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], the element at index i+1 is the minimum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], and the rest are the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than half the length of a, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i less than half the length of a, the element at index i is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], the element at index i+1 is the maximum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], and the rest are the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i greater than or equal to half the length of a, mid is half the length of a, i is less than the length of a minus 1 and is three more than its original value, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x and an integer y, _ is 1

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
