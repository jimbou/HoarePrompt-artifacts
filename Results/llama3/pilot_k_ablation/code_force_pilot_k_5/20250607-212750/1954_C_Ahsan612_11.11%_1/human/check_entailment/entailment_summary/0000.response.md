Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement, swapping the i-th digit in x and the i-th digit in y to maximize the product of x and y. The program first reads the input, then processes each pair of integers by comparing their corresponding digits and printing the maximum and minimum values for the first half of the digits and the minimum and maximum values for the second half of the digits. This approach ensures that the product of x and y is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
