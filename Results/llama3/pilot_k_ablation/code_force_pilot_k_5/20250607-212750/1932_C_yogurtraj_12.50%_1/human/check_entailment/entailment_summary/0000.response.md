Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the commands in the string s from left to right, removing elements from the array a and updating the product modulo m accordingly. The program uses a clever approach by iterating over the string t in reverse order, which allows it to efficiently calculate the product modulo m for each command. The use of the variables q1 and q2 to keep track of the indices of the elements to be removed from the array a is also a good optimization. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the string t starts or ends with 'L' or 'R'. The output is also correctly formatted, with the remainders printed in the correct order.

Correctness: **True**
