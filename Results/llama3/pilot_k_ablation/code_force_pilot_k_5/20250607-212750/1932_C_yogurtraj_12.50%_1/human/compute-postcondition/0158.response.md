To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 2, because the loop starts from `n - 2` and goes down to `-1`. The variable `i` should be adjusted to `n - 2` to reflect the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `i` is `n - 2`.**
