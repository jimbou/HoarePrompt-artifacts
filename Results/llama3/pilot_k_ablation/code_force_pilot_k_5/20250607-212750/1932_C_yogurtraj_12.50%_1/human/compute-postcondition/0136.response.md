Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, i is n - 4, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t. If t[i] is 'R', y is a string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, where k is the remainder of the integer at index q2 in list a divided by m. If t[i] is not 'R', y is a string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, where k is the remainder of the integer at index q1 in list a divided by m. q1 is l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1. q2 is l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 2. If t[i] is not 'R', k is k * a[q1] % m and q1 is q1 - 1. If t[i] is 'R', q2 is q2 + 1.***
