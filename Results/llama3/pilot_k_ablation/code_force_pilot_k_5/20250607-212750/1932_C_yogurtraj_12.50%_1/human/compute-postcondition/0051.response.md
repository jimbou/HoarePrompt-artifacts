Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-2`, `y` is a string that contains a space and the string representation of `k` followed by another space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is the result of either `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is either `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `y` now contains an additional space and the string representation of `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
