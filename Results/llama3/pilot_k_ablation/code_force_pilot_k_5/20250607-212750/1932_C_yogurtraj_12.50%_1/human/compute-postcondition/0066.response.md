Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-5`, `y` is a string that contains a space and the string representation of `k` followed by another space and the string representation of `k`, and then another space and the string representation of `k`, and then another space and the string representation of `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is the result of `(k * a[q2] % m) * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is the result of `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is `q1 - 1`.**
