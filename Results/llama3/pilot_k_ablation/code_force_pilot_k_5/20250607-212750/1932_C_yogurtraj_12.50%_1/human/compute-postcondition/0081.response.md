Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is 0, y is the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the division of the integer at index l-1 in list a by m if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise k is a[l] % m, q1 is l-2 if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of y has been updated to be the string representation of k. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of k is still dependent on the last character of string t and the values in list a. The values of q1 and q2 are also still dependent on the last character of string t.
