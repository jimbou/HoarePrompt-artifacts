Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is either the same or decremented by 1, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `k` is updated based on whether the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not. If it is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, otherwise it is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. The value of `q1` is either the same or decremented by 1, and the value of `q2` is either incremented by 1 or updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`.
