To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the loop starts from `n - 2` and goes down to `-1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 2`**
