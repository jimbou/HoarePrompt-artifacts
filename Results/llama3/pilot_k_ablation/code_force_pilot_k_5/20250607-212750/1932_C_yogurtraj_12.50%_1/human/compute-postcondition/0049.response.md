Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n-2, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of k, k is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is 'L' or (a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m otherwise, q1 is either l - 3 if the last character of t is 'L' or l - 2 otherwise, q2 is either l if the last character of t is 'L' or l + 1 otherwise, stdin is empty. The character at index i of t is not 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated based on the previous value of `k` and the value of `a[q1]`. The value of `q1` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
