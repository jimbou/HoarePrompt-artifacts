Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = str(k)
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y += ' ' + str(k)
    print(y[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is -1, y is updated by appending a space and the string representation of k to its previous value for each iteration of the loop, k is either k * a[q2] % m or k * a[q1] % m depending on the character at index i in string t, q1 is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, q2 is either incremented by 1 or remains the same, and the reverse of the string y is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is -1, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of k followed by another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and so on, until there are n-1 spaces and the string representation of k, k is the result of either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and t[i] is 'R', or (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', q1 is either q1 - 1 if t[i] is not 'R' or remains the same if t[i] is 'R', q2 is either q2 + 1 if t[i] is 'R' or remains the same if t[i] is not 'R', and the reverse of the string y is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is -1, q1 is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, q2 is either increased by 1 or remains the same, k is the remainder of the division of the product of k and the integer at index q2 in list a by m if t[i] == 'R', otherwise k is the remainder of the division of the product of k and the integer at index q1 in list a by m, y is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is -1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, where `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is the remainder of the product of the old `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m`. The values of `q1` and `q2` depend on the last character of `t` and are updated accordingly. `y` has been appended with a space and the string representation of `k` again. The loop has finished executing, and the variables `i`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` have been updated according to the loop's logic. The variable `y` has been appended with the string representation of `k` for each iteration of the loop. The other variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged. The string `y` in reverse order is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the updated string representation of k n-2 times, i is -1, q1 and q2 are integers, k is an integer that has been updated based on the values of t[i], q1, q2, a[q1], a[q2], and m, and the reverse of the string y is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
