Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n-2, y is the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the division of the integer at index q2-1 in list a by m if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise k is a[q2] % m, q1 is l-2 if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l + 1 if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 2, stdin contains no input, t[i] is 'R'.**

The code modifies the value of k and q2. The first line multiplies k by a[q2] and takes the remainder of the division by m, updating the value of k. The second line increments q2 by 1. The value of q2 depends on the value of t[-1]. If t[-1] is 'L', q2 is l + 1, otherwise q2 is l + 2. The value of k also depends on the value of t[-1]. If t[-1] is 'L', k is the remainder of the division of the integer at index q2-1 in list a by m, otherwise k is a[q2] % m.
