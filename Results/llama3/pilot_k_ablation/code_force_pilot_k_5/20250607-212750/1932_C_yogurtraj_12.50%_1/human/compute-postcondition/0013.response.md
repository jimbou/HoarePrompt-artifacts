Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, stdin is empty, i is n - 2. If the character at index i in string t is 'R', then q2 is incremented by 1 and k is updated to k * a[q2] % m. Otherwise, q1 is decremented by 1 and k is updated to k * a[q1] % m.***
