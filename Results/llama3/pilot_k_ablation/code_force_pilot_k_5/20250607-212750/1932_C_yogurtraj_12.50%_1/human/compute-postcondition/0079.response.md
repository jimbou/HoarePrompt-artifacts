Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is 0, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of a[l] % m followed by another space and the string representation of a[l] % m, and then another space and the string representation of a[l] % m, and then another space and the string representation of a[l] % m, and then another space and the string representation of a[l] % m, and then another space and the string representation of a[l] % m, and so on, until there are n-1 spaces and the string representation of a[l] % m, k is a[l] % m, q1 is l - 1, q2 is l + 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m. The string y has been updated to contain the string representation of this new value of k, repeated n-1 times, separated by spaces. The values of q1 and q2 have been updated to be l - 1 and l + 1, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
