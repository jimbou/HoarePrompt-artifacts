Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a string representation of k, k is the remainder of the integer at index l - 1 in list a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise k is the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 1.**

In this output state, the value of y is a string representation of k, which is determined by the value of l and the last character of t. The values of n, m, a, t, l, k, q1, and q2 remain the same as in the initial state, with the exception that y is now assigned the string representation of k.
