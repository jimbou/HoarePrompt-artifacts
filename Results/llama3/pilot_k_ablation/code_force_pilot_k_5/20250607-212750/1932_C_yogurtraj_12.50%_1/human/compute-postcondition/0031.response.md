Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n - 6, y is updated by appending a space and the string representation of k to its previous value, k is k * a[q2] % m, q1 is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, q2 is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by multiplying it with the integer at index `q2` in list `a` and taking the modulus `m`. The value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. The value of `y` has been updated by appending a space and the string representation of the new value of `k` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
