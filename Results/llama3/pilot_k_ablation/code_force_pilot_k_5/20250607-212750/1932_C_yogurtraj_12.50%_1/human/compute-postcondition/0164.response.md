Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or remains the same, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or remains the same, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to include the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k`. The values of `q1` and `q2` have been updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`. If the character is 'R', `q2` is incremented by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. If the character is not 'R', `q1` is decremented by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
