Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `i` is 0. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or remains the same, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or remains the same, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` twice, `i` is `n - 3`, `q1` and `q2` are integers, `k` is an integer that has been updated based on the values of `t[i]`, `q1`, `q2`, `a[q1]`, `a[q2]`, and `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the updated string representation of k three times, i is n - 4. If t[i] is 'R', then q2 is incremented by 1 and k is updated to k * a[q2] modulo m. If t[i] is not 'R', then q1 is decremented by 1 and k is updated to k * a[q1] modulo m.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` four times, `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is the updated value of `k` after the last operation, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the last operation on `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 5, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` five times, `i` is `n - 6`, `k` is the updated value of `k` after the last operation, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the last operation on `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to be the product of `k` and `a[q1]` modulo `m`, `q1` is decremented by 1, and `q2` is updated based on the last operation on `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
