Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 5, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` four times, `i` is `n - 6`, `k` is the updated value of `k` after the last operation, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the last operation on `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to be the product of `k` and `a[q1]` modulo `m`, `q1` is decremented by 1, and `q2` is updated based on the last operation on `k`.***
