Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is 0, y is the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the division of the integer at index l-1 in list a by m if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise k is a[l] % m, q1 is l-2 if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 1, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-2`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2-1` in list `a` by `m` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is `a[q2] % m` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is `l-2` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `q1 - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-3`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or unchanged, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or unchanged, `k` is either the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` or the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-4`, `q1` is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, `q2` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m` or the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` multiplied by `a[q1]` and then taken modulo `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-5`, `q1` is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, `q2` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, otherwise `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-6`, `q1` is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, `q2` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, otherwise `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
