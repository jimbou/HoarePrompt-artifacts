The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n - 3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 3`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m` depending on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same**
