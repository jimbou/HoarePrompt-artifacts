Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 5`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, where `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is the remainder of the product of the old `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m`. The values of `q1` and `q2` depend on the last character of `t` and are updated accordingly. `y` has been appended with a space and the string representation of `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `y` has been appended with a space and the string representation of `k`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `q1`, and `q2` remain unchanged.
