Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `i` is 0. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the string representation of `k`. The value of `k` depends on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not. If it is 'L', then `k` is the remainder of `a[l - 1]` divided by `m`, and if it is not 'L', then `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
