Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-2`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2-1` in list `a` by `m` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is `a[q2] % m` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is `l-2` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `q1 - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l` if `t[-1]` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to include a space and the string representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
