Output State: **n and m are integers, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, stdin is empty. If the last character of t is 'L', then k is a[l - 1] % m, q1 is l - 2, q2 is l, y is the string representation of a[l - 1] % m. If the last character of t is not 'L', then k is the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 1, q2 is l + 1, y is the string representation of the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable y, which is the string representation of the value of k. The value of k depends on whether the last character of string t is 'L' or not. If it is 'L', then k is the remainder of the integer at index l-1 in list a divided by m, and y is the string representation of this value. If the last character of t is not 'L', then k is the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m, and y is the string representation of this value.
