Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is 0, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of k, k is 0, q1 is 0, q2 is 0, stdin is empty**

Explanation:

* The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m, respectively. Since n is at least 3, the new value of n is still at least 3. The value of m is updated to the newly read integer.
* The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to a. The list of integers is now stored in a.
* The third line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to t. The string is now stored in t.
* The fourth line calculates the number of 'L' characters in t and assigns it to l. The value of l is now the count of 'L' characters in t.
* The fifth line initializes k to 0.
* The sixth and seventh lines initialize q1 and q2 to 0, respectively.
