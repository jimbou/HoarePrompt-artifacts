Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 5`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, where `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is the remainder of the product of the old `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m`. The values of `q1` and `q2` depend on the last character of `t` and are updated accordingly.**
