Output: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is -1, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of k followed by another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and so on, until there are n-1 spaces and the string representation of k, k is the result of either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and t[i] is 'R', or (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', q1 is either q1 - 1 if t[i] is not 'R' or remains the same if t[i] is 'R', q2 is either q2 + 1 if t[i] is 'R' or remains the same if t[i] is not 'R', and the reverse of the string y is printed.**
