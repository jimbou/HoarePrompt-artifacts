Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is n-2, `y` is a string that contains a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `a[l] % m` otherwise, `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - 1` otherwise, `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l + 1` otherwise, stdin is empty. The current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**
