State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 5`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, where `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2**, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is `q2 + 1` if `t[i]` is 'R'.
