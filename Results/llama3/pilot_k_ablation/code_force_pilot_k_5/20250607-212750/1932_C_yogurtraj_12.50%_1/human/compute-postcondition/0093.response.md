Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-3`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or unchanged, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or unchanged, `k` is either the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` or the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, and the value of `q2` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same, depending on the value of `t[i]`. The value of `k` is either the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` or the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m`, depending on the value of `t[i]`. The value of `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.
