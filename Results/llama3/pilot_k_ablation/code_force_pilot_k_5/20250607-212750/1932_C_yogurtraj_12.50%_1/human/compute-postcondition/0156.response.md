Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is an empty string, i is 0. If the last character of t is 'L', then k is a[l - 1] % m, q1 is l - 2, and q2 is l. Otherwise, k is the remainder of a[l] divided by m, q1 is l - 1, and q2 is l + 1.***
