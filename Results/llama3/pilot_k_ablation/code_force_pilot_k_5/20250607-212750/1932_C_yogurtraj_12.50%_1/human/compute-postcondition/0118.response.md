Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is a[l] % m, q1 is l - 1, q2 is l + 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of variables k, q1, and q2. The first line assigns the remainder of the division of the element at index l in list a by m to k. The second line assigns the value of l - 1 to q1. The third line assigns the value of l + 1 to q2. The values of n, m, a, t, and l remain unchanged.
