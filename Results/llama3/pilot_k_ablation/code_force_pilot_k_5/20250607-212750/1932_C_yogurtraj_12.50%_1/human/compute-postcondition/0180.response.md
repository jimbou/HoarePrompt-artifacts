The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 5`, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again `i` must be decreased by 1 so `i` is `n - 6` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` four times, `i` is `n - 6`, `k` is the updated value of `k` after the last operation, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the last operation on `k`.**
