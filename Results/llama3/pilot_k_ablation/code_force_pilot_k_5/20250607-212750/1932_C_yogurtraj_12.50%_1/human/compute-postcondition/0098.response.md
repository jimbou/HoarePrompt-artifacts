Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-4`, `q1` is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, `q2` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m` or the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` multiplied by `a[q1]` and then taken modulo `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `m` is still an integer, and `a` is still a list of integers. The string `t` and the number of 'L' characters in `t` (`l`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n-4`. The values of `q1` and `q2` may have changed, but their exact values depend on the previous values of `t[i]`. The value of `k` has been updated based on the previous values of `q1`, `q2`, and `a`. The string `y` has been appended with another space and the string representation of `k`.
