Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n-4. If t[i] is 'R', q2 is increased by 1, k is the remainder of the division of the product of k and the integer at index q2 in list a by m, and y is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k. Otherwise, q1 is either decreased by 1 or 2, q2 is either increased by 1 or unchanged, k is the remainder of the division of the integer at index q1 in list a by m multiplied by a[q1] and then taken modulo m, and y is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k.***
