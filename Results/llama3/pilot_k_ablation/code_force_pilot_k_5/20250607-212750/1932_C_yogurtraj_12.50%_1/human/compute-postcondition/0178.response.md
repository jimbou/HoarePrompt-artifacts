Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` three times, `i` is `n - 5`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated by multiplying it with `a[q2]` modulo `m`, and `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is updated by multiplying it with `a[q1]` modulo `m`, and `q1` is decremented by 1.***
