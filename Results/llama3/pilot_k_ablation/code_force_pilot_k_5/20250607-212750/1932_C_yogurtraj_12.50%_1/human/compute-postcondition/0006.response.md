Postcondition: ***n and m are integers, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, stdin is empty. If the last character of t is 'L', then k is a[l - 1] % m, q1 is l - 2, q2 is l. If the last character of t is not 'L', then k is the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 1, q2 is l + 1.***
