Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is 0, stdin is empty. If the last character of t is 'L', then y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of a[l - 1] % m, k is a[l - 1] % m, q1 is l - 2, and q2 is l. Otherwise, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of k, k is a[l] % m, q1 is l - 1, and q2 is l + 1.***
