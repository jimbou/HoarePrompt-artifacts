Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-2`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `l-1` in list `a` by `m` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l-2` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.***
