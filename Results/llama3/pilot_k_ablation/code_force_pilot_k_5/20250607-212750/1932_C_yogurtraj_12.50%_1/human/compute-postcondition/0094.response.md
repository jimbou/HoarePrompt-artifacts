To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved in it. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is `n-3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 (since the step is -1), so `i` becomes `n-4`.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `q1`, `q2`, `k`, and `y`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-4`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or unchanged, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or unchanged, `k` is either the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` or the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.**
