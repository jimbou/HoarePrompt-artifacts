Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 2`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m` depending on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n - 2`. The value of `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value. The value of `k` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`. If the character is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.
