Output State: **n is at least 3, i is n - 5, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, where k is the remainder of the integer at index q1 in list a divided by m if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise k is the remainder of the integer at index q2 in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 3 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 2, q2 is l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 2, k is the remainder of the product of the old k and the integer at index q1 in list a divided by m.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code modifies the values of `k` and `q1`. The new value of `k` is the remainder of the product of the old `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m`. The value of `q1` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is still a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, but the value of `k` has changed. The value of `q2` is still dependent on the last character of `t` and the value of `l`.
