To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 5` and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop iterates in reverse order with a step of -1), and `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 6`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`.**
