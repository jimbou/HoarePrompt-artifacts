Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-3`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is the remainder of the division of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m` and `q1` is `q1 - 1`.**
