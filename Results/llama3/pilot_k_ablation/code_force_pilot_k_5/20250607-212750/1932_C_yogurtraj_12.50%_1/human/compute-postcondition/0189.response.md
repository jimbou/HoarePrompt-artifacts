Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers (a), and a string (t) of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. It then processes the test case by iterating over the string t in reverse order, updating an integer k based on the characters in t and the corresponding values in a, and appending the updated k to a string y. Finally, it prints the reverse of the string y. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
