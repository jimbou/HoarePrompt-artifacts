Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 6`, `k` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t` and other conditions, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `k` is updated based on whether the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, and the values of `q1` and `q2` are updated accordingly. The value of `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of the updated `k` to its previous value.
