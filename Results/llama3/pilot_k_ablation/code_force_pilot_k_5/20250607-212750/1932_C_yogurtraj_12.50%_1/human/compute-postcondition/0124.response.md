Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k`, `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l - 1` in list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l` in list `a` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, and the character at index `i` in string `t` is not 'R'***
