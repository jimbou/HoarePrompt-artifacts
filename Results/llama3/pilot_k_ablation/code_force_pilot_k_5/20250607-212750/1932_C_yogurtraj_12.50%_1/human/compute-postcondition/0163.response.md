Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `t` is not 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.***
