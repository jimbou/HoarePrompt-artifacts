Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-5`, `q1` is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, `q2` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, otherwise `k` is the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q1` in list `a` by `m`, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `y` has been appended with another space and the string representation of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
