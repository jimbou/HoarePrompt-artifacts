Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-4`, `y` is a string that contains a space and the string representation of `k` followed by another space and the string representation of `k`, and then another space and the string representation of `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is the result of `(k * a[q2] % m) * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `(k * a[q2] % m) * a[q2 + 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is the result of either `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1 - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q1 - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'.***
