Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, where `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is `q2 + 1` if `t[i]` is 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still `n - 4`, `m` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of integers, `t` is still a string, `l` is still the number of 'L' characters in `t`. The value of `y` has been updated to include an additional space and the string representation of `k`, where `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q1` in list `a` divided by `m` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `q2` in list `a` divided by `m`. The values of `q1` and `q2` have been updated based on the last character of `t` and the value of `t[i]`. The value of `k` has been updated based on the value of `t[i]` and the values of `q1` and `q2`.
