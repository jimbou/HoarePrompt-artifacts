Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n - 3, y is updated by appending a space and the string representation of k to its previous value, k is k * a[q2] % m, q1 remains the same, q2 is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains at least 3, and `m` remains an integer. The list `a` and string `t` also remain unchanged. The number of 'L' characters in `t`, denoted by `l`, is still the same. The value of `i` is still `n - 3`. The variable `y` has been updated by appending a space and the string representation of the new value of `k` to its previous value. The value of `k` has been updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, where `q2` has been incremented by 1. The value of `q1` remains the same.
