Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n - 4, k is k * a[q1] % m, q1 is q1 - 1, q2 is updated based on the character at index i in string t, and y is updated by appending a space and the string representation of k to its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by multiplying it with the value of `a[q1]` and taking the modulus `m`. The value of `q1` has been decremented by 1. The value of `y` has been updated by appending a space and the string representation of the new value of `k` to its previous value. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `i`, `q2` remain unchanged.
