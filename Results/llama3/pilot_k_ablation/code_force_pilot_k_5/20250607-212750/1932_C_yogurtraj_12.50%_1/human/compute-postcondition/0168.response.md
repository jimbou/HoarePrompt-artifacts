Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is increased by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then either `q1` is decreased by 1 or remains the same, and `q2` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, and `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] * a[q1] % m`.***
