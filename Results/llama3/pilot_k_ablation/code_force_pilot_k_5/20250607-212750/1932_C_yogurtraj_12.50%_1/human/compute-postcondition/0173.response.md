Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the updated string representation of k twice, i is n - 4. If t[i] is 'R', then q2 is incremented by 1 and k is updated to k * a[q2] modulo m. If t[i] is not 'R', then q1 is decremented by 1 and k is updated to k * a[q1] modulo m.***
