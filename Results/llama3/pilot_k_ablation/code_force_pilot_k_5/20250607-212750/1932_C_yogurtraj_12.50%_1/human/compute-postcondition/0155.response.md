The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of variables k, q1, and q2. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line assigns the value of a[l] % m to k. Since a is a list of integers, and l is the number of 'L' characters in string t, a[l] is an integer. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of a[l] by m, which is also an integer. Therefore, k becomes an integer equal to the remainder of a[l] divided by m.

The second line assigns the value of l - 1 to q1. Since l is the number of 'L' characters in string t, which is an integer, q1 becomes an integer equal to l - 1.

The third line assigns the value of l + 1 to q2. Similarly, since l is an integer, q2 becomes an integer equal to l + 1.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of n, m, a, t, y, and i remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is an empty string, k is an integer equal to the remainder of a[l] divided by m, q1 is an integer equal to l - 1, q2 is an integer equal to l + 1, i is 0**
