The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-3`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-4` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n-4`, `y` is a string that contains a space and the string representation of `k` followed by another space and the string representation of `k`, and then another space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is the result of either `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is either `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is 'R', or `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and `t[i]` is not 'R'. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is `l + 1` and `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `q1` is either `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', and `k` is the result of either `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1 - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q1 - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'.
