Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, and `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `i`, `q1`, and `q2` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `k` has been updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, and the values of `q1` and `q2` have been updated accordingly.
