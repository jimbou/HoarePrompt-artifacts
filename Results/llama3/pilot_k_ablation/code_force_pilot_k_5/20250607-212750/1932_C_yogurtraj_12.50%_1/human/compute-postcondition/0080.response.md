Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is 0, y is a string that contains a space and the string representation of k followed by another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and then another space and the string representation of k, and so on, until there are n-1 spaces and the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the division of the integer at index l-1 in list a by m if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise k is a[l] % m, q1 is l-2 if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l if t[-1] is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 1, stdin contains no input.***
