Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value for each iteration of the loop.
* `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m` depending on the character at index `i` in string `t`.
* `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same.
* `q2` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same.
* `i` is -1, which means the loop will iterate from the end of the string `t` to the beginning.

Since `i` is -1, the loop will start from the last character of `t` and move backwards. For each iteration, `k` will be updated based on the character at index `i` in `t`, and `y` will be appended with a space and the string representation of `k`.

The `print` statement prints `y[::-1]`, which means it prints the string `y` in reverse order.

Since `y` is built by appending strings to its previous value, the final value of `y` will be a concatenation of the string representations of `k` at each iteration, separated by spaces. The order of these string representations will be the reverse of the order in which they were appended, due to the `[::-1]` slicing.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the string representations of `k` at each iteration, in the reverse order of the characters in `t`, separated by spaces.

Output: **a string containing the string representations of k at each iteration, in the reverse order of the characters in t, separated by spaces**
