Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 3`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value. If the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` remains the same, and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decremented by 1, and `q2` remains the same.***
