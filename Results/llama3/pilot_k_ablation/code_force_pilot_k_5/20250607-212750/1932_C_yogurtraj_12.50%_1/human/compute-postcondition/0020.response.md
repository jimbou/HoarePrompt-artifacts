To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, which is greater than -1 since `n` is at least 3.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to decrease `i` by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, and `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value.**
