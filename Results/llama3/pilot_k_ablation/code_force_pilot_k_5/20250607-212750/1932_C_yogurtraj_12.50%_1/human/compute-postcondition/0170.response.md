The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n - 4` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the updated string representation of `k` twice, `i` is `n - 4`, `q1` and `q2` are integers, `k` is an integer that has been updated based on the values of `t[i]`, `q1`, `q2`, `a[q1]`, `a[q2]`, and `m`.**
