Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, i is n-6, q1 is either decreased by 1 or 2 or remains the same, q2 is increased by 1, k is the remainder of the division of the product of k and the integer at index q2 in list a by m, y is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the remainder of the division of the product of `k` and the integer at index `q2` in list `a` by `m`. The value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
