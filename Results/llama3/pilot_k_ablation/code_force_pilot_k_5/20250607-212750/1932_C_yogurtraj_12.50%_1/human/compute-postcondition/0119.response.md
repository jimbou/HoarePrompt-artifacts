Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t. If the last character of t is 'L', then k is the remainder of the integer at index l - 1 in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 2, and q2 is l. Otherwise, k is the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 1, and q2 is l + 1.***
