Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and m are integers, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, stdin is empty. If the last character of t is 'L', then k is a[l - 1] % m, q1 is l - 2, q2 is l, y is the string representation of a[l - 1] % m. If the last character of t is not 'L', then k is the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m, q1 is l - 1, q2 is l + 1, y is the string representation of the remainder of the integer at index l in list a divided by m.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 2`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m` depending on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, and `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is either the same or decremented by 1, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 5`, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value, `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is either decremented by 1 or remains the same, `q2` is either incremented by 1 or updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `i` is `n - 6`, `k` is updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t`, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the character at index `i` in string `t` and other conditions, `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
