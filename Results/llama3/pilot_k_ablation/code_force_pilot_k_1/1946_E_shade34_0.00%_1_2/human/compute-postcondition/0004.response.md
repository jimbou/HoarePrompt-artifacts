Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is less than `b`, `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`, `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`, respectively. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
