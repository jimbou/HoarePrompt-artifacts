Output State: **The program returns two values: `d` which is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d`, where `a` is an integer greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `b` is a non-zero integer, and `c` is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
