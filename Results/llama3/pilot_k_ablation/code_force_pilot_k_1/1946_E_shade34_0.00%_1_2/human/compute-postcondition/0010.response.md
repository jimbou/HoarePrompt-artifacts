Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `b` is a non-zero integer, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code. The code only assigns the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)` to `c` and `d`, respectively. The precondition that `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b` still holds true after the code execution. The values of `c` and `d` are now determined by the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, which are not specified in the initial state.
