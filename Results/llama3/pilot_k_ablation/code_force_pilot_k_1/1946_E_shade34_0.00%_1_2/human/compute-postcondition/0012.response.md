Functionality: **This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the results in reverse order. If a is greater than or equal to b and a is divisible by b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. If a is greater than or equal to b but not divisible by b, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second result of func_1 and the difference between the first result of func_1 and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second result of func_1.**
