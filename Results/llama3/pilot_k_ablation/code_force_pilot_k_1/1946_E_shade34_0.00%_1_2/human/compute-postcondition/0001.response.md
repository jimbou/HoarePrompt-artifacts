Output State: **The program returns the product of the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and a non-negative integer `a`, modulo 1000000007, where `b` is a non-negative prime number.**

In this output state, the returned value is the result of multiplying `c` (which is the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`) and `a` (a non-negative integer), and then taking the remainder when divided by 1000000007. The value of `b` is a non-negative prime number, which is used as an input to the `func_1` function to compute `c`.
