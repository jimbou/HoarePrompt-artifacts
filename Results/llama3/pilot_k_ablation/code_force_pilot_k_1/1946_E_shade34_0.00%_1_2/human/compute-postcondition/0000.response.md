Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer such that `b` is a prime number, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` function call, `d` is the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` function call.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `c` is updated to be the result of the function call `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, and a new variable `d` is introduced with the same value as `c`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so its exact behavior is unknown, but it is assumed to return two values.
