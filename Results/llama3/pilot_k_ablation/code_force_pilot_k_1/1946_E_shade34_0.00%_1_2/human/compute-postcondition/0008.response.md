Output State: **The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. The value of a // b is at least 1 because a is greater than or equal to b. Therefore, the second value is a negative integer.**
