Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number, which is used in `func_2` to calculate the modular exponentiation.

The main logic of the program is not shown in the given code snippet, but based on the problem description, it is likely that the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations.

However, there are a few issues with the given code snippet:

1. The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are both 0. In this case, the function should return (1, 0), but it will actually return (0, 0) which is incorrect.

2. The function `func_2` does not handle the case where `a` is 0. In this case, the function should return 0, but it will actually return 1 which is incorrect.

3. The function `func_2` uses the modular multiplicative inverse calculated by `func_1` to calculate the modular exponentiation. However, this approach is not efficient for large values of `a` and `b`.

4. The program does not check if the input values are valid. For example, it does not check if `n` is a positive integer, or if `m1` and `m2` are less than or equal to `n`.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input values are too large. For example, if `n` is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, the program will overflow.

6. The program does not check if the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are valid. For example, it does not check if the prefix maximums are in increasing order, or if the suffix maximums are in decreasing order.

7. The program does not handle the case where there are no prefix maximums or suffix maximums.

8. The program does not handle the case where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are the same.

9. The program does not handle the case where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are not disjoint.

10. The program does not handle the case where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are not subsets of the set of indices from 1 to `n`.

Correctness: **False**
