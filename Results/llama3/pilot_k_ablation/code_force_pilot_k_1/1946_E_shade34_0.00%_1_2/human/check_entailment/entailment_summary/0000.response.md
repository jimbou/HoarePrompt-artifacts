Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of a given length, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Function `func_1` is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `b` modulo 1000000007. This function is used in `func_2` to calculate the modular product of two numbers.

Function `func_2` is used to calculate the modular product of two numbers `a` and `b` modulo 1000000007. This function is used in the main program to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

The main program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is equal to 1 and the last suffix maximum is equal to `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of suitable permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums. For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements to its right, and for each prefix maximum, it calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements to its left. The program uses `func_2` to calculate the modular product of these numbers.

The program finally prints the total number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that the program is correctly implementing the necessary calculations to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
