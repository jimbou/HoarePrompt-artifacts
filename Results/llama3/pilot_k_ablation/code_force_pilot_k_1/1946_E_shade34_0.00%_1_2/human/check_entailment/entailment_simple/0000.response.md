Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0, which is correct because these conditions are necessary for a valid permutation.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of permutations using the formula for combinations (n choose k) and the modular inverse function (func_2). The program correctly calculates the combinations and the modular inverses, and it correctly applies the modulo operation to avoid overflow.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of prefix maximums is 1 and the number of suffix maximums is 1, in which case the number of permutations is simply 1.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
