Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and modular arithmetic. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse and perform modular multiplication, respectively.

The program first initializes a list of factorials modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate combinations. It then reads input data, including the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, as well as the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is equal to the length of the permutation. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0.

Otherwise, the program calculates the number of suitable permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, using the `func_2` function to calculate combinations and the `func_1` function to calculate modular multiplicative inverses. The program then prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

The `func_1` function is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the extended Euclidean algorithm. The function takes two integers as input and returns two values: the modular multiplicative inverse and the coefficient of the second input in the BÃ©zout's identity.

The `func_2` function is used to perform modular multiplication involving the result of `func_1`. It takes three integers as input and returns the product of the first input and the result of `func_1`, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
