#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer and 0 is also an integer.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, and `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. The value of a // b is at least 1 because a is greater than or equal to b. Therefore, the second value is a negative integer.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0, a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns two values: `d` which is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d`, where `a` is an integer greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `b` is a non-zero integer, and `c` is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the results in reverse order. If a is greater than or equal to b and a is divisible by b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. If a is greater than or equal to b but not divisible by b, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second result of func_1 and the difference between the first result of func_1 and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second result of func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and c are non-negative integers, b is a non-negative integer such that b is a prime number.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and a non-negative integer `a`, modulo 1000000007, where `b` is a non-negative prime number.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer `a` and a non-negative prime number `b` as inputs, calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to obtain values `c` and `d`, and returns the product of `c` and `a` modulo 1000000007, effectively computing a modular product involving the result of `func_1` and input `a`.
