The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). 

After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). 

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
