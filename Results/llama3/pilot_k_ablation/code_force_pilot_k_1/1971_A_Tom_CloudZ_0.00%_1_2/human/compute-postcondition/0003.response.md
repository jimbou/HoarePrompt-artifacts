The `print(max(a, b), min(a, b))` statement will print the maximum and minimum values between the two integers `a` and `b`.

Since `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `b` is also an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, the maximum value that can be printed is 9 and the minimum value that can be printed is 0.

However, without knowing the exact values of `a` and `b`, we can't determine the exact output. But we can describe the output as the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b) (which is the maximum value between a and b), min(a, b) (which is the minimum value between a and b)**
