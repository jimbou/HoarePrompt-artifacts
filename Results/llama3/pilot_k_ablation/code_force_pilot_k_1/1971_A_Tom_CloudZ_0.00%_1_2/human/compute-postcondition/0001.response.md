To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (even though `_` is a throwaway variable, its state still matters for the loop to execute).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to ensure that `_` is initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the range function.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), `_` is 0**
