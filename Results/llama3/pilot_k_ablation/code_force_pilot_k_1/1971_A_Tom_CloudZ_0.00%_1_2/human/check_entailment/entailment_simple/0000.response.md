Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for each test case. The program reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y, and prints the maximum and minimum of the two integers.

However, there is a mistake in the print statement. The program prints the maximum first, followed by the minimum, whereas the problem statement requires the minimum to be printed first, followed by the maximum.

Correctness: **False**
