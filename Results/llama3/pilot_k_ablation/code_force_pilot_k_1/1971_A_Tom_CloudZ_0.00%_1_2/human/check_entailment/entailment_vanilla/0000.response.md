Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
3. Inside the function, it reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
4. It then iterates over the range of `t` using a for loop.
5. In each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from the input using the `map()` function.
6. The program then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `max()` and `min()` functions, respectively.

However, there is a mistake in the order of the print statement. The problem requires the minimum to be printed first, followed by the maximum. But in the program, the maximum is printed first, followed by the minimum.

Correctness: **False**
