Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row, and then wins once. The amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win is calculated by iteratively adding (s // (k - 1) + 1) x times, where s is the current amount of coins Sasha has.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins Sasha has (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum amount of coins (s). If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases where k = 2, x = 1, and a = 1, as well as cases where k, x, and a are large.

Correctness: **True**
