Output State: **`k` is `t`, `x` is the second integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the third integer, `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `stdin` contains the remaining lines of input, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `k` is equal to `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now dependent on the value of `k`, which is `t`. The stdin still contains the remaining lines of input, and the value of `i` is still 0.
