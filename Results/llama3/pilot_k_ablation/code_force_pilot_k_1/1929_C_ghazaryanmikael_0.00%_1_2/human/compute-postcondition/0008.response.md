Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains three integers k, x, and a. For each line of input, it calculates a sum s by iteratively adding (s // (k - 1) + 1) x times, and then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all lines of input, stdin is empty, and the last values of k, x, a, and s are retained.**
