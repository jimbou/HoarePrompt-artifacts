The code prints 'YES' if the third integer `a` is greater than or equal to the sum `s`, which is calculated as the second integer `x` times (`s // (k - 1) + 1`), where `k` is equal to `t`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
Output: **YES if a >= s, NO otherwise (where a is the third integer, s is the sum of x times (s // (k - 1) + 1), k is t, and x is the second integer)**
