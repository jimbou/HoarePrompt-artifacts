Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking the number of '1's in each row of the grid. If a row contains only one '1', it sets the variable `a` to 'Triangle'. If a row contains more than one '1', it sets the variable `b` to 'Square'. After checking all rows, it prints 'Triangle' if `a` is not zero, otherwise it prints 'Square'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement specifies that a triangle can have multiple rows with multiple '1's, as long as the number of '1's in each row is increasing or decreasing by 2. The program does not check for this condition.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case where the grid contains a square. A square can have multiple rows with the same number of '1's, but the program only checks if a row contains more than one '1'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
