Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine whether a given binary square grid contains a triangle or a square shape. The program reads the number of test cases, the size of the grid, and the grid itself. It then checks each row of the grid to determine if it contains a triangle or a square.

However, the program has several issues:

1.  The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it's a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.
2.  The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if it's a square. This is also incorrect because a square can have only one '1' in a row, as long as the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
3.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the grid contains a square. It only checks if a row contains more than one '1', but it does not verify if the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
4.  The program does not handle the case where the grid contains an upside-down triangle.

Due to these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
