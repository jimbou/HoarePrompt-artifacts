Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It only checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' (in which case it prints "Triangle") or if there is a row with more than one '1' (in which case it prints "Square"). However, this is not sufficient to determine the shape.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

The program will print "Square" because the last row has more than one '1'. However, the correct output should be "Triangle" because the '1's form a triangle shape.

The program does not check the structure of the '1's in the grid, it only checks the count of '1's in each row. Therefore, it is incorrect.
