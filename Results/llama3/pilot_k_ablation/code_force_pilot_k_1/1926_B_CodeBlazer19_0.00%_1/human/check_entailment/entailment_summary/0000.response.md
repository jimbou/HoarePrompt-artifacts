Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks each row of the grid separately and prints "Triangle" if it finds a row with exactly one '1', and "Square" if it finds a row with more than one '1'. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.

For example, consider the following grid:

000
011
011

The program will print "Square" for this grid because it finds a row with more than one '1'. However, this grid actually represents a triangle, not a square.

To correctly determine the shape of the grid, the program needs to check the entire grid, not just each row separately. It needs to check if the '1's form a triangle or a square shape.

Correctness: **False**
