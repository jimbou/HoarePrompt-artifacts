Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it's a triangle, and if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if it's a square. However, this logic is flawed.

A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. Similarly, a square can have exactly one '1' in a row, as long as the '1' is in the same column in each row.

The program also does not correctly handle the case where no '1's are found in any row. In this case, the program will print nothing, but it should print "TRIANGLE" or "SQUARE" depending on the shape.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should count the number of '1's in each row and check if the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row for a triangle, or if the number of '1's is the same in each row for a square.

Correctness: **False**
