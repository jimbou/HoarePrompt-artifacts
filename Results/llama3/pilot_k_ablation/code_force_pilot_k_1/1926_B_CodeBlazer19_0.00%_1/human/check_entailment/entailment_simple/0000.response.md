Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it sets `a` to 'Triangle'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'. 

Similarly, the program checks if a row contains more than one '1' and if so, it sets `b` to 'Square'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have all rows with the same number of '1's, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program also does not handle the case where the grid contains neither a triangle nor a square. In this case, `a` will be 0 and `b` will be an empty string, and an empty string will be printed.

Correctness: **False**
