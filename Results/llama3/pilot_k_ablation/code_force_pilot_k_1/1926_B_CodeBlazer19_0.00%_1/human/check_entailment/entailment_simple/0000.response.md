Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it prints "Triangle". However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. The program also checks if any row contains more than one '1' and if so, it prints "Square". However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square can have more than one '1' in a row, but the number of '1's must be the same in each row.

The program does not correctly implement the conditions for a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement. It does not check the number of '1's in each row, nor does it check if the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Correctness: **False**
