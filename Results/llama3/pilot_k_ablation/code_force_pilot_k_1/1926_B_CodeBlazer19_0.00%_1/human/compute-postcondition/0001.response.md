The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, because the loop starts from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1, `i` is 0**
