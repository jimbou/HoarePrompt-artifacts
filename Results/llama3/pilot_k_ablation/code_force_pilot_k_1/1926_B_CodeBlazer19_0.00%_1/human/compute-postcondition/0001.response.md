To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `t` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` followed by `n` lines each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. This information does not affect the execution of the loop, as the loop only depends on the value of `t`.

Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0**

Note that we set `i` to 0, as the loop will start from the first iteration when `i` is 0.
