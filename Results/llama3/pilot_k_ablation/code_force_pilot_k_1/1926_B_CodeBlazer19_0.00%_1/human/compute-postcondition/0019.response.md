Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases. If any string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then the current value of `a` is 'Triangle' and it is being printed. If any string `s` contains more than one '1' character, then `b` is 'Square' and an empty string is being printed. If no string `s` contains exactly one '1' character and no string `s` contains more than one '1' character, then `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, and an empty string is being printed.**
