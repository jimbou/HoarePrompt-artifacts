Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is either 0 or 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If `n` is 0, then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. If `n` is greater than 0, then `a` is 'Triangle' if and only if at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1', and `b` is 'Square' if and only if at least one string `s` contains more than one '1's.**
