Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints the shape ('Triangle' or 'Square') of a single shape composed of '1's in a grid, or an empty string if no shape is found. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the shape of the grid for each test case. After execution, the function has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding shapes or empty strings.**
