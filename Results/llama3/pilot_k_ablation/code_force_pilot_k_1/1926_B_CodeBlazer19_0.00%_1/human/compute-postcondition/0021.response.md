Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `n` lines of strings containing '0' or '1' characters. It checks each string for the presence of exactly one '1' (indicating a 'Triangle') or more than one '1' (indicating a 'Square'). If a 'Triangle' is found, it prints 'Triangle'. Otherwise, it prints 'Square' if a 'Square' is found; otherwise, it prints nothing. The function processes all `t` test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
