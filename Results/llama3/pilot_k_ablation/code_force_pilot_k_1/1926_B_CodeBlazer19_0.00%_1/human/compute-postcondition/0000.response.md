The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines each containing a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The first input is an integer t. So after accepting the integer t, stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines each containing a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The value of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines each containing a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1'.**
