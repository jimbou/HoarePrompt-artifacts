The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. This means that the first input is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100, inclusive. The remaining input in stdin is still t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, stdin contains t test cases.

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**
