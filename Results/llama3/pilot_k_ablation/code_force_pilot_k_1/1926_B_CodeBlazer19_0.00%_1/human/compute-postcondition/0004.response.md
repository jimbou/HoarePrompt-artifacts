Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is assigned the input string from `stdin`, which contains `t-1` test cases initially. Since one test case is consumed by the `input()` function, `t-2` test cases remain in `stdin`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
