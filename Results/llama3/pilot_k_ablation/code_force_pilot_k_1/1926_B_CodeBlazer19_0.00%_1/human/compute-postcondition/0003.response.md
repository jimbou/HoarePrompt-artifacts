According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be 0, since it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
