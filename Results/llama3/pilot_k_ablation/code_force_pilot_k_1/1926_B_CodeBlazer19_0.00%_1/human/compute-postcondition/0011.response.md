Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1' character, then `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains 0. If the string `s` contains no '1' characters, then `b` remains an empty string and `a` remains 0.***
