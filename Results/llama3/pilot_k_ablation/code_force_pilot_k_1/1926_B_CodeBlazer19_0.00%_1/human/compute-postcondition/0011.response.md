Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer that is greater than 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains no inputs. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
