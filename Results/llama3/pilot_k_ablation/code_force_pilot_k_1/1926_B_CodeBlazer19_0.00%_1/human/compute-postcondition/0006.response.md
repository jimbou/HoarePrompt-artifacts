Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer that is greater than 0, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string that contains exactly one '1', `j` is 0, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer that is greater than 0, `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string that contains exactly one '1', `j` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs is still valid.
