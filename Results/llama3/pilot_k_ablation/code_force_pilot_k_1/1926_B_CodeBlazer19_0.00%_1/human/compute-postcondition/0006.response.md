Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string containing exactly one '1' character, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The input state still contains `t-2` test cases, and the other variables retain their initial values.
