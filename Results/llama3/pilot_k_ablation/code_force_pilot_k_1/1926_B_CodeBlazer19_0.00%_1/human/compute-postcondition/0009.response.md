Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, inclusive, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string containing more than one '1', stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', while all other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains `t-2` test cases.
