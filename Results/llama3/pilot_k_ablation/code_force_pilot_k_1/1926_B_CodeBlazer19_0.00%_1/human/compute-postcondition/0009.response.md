The code assigns the string 'Square' to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is empty and remains empty.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer that is greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is a string that contains more than one '1's, `j` is 0, stdin contains no inputs.**
