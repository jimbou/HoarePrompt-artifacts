This function reads input from stdin, processes pairs of strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9, and prints two strings for each pair. If all pairs of corresponding digits in a pair are equal, it prints the smaller digit from each pair. If there is at least one pair of corresponding digits that are not equal, it prints the larger digit from each pair. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases (t) and then empties the stdin.
