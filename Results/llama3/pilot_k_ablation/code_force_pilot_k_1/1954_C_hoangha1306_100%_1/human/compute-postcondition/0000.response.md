The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains 2t lines, where each pair of lines contains two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t lines, where each pair of lines contains two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.**
