Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string containing the digit at index i of a, kq2 is a string containing the digit at index i of a, vt is 0, i is 0, and the current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i].**

In this output state, the code has appended the digit at index i of string a to both kq1 and kq2, resulting in both kq1 and kq2 containing the same digit. The continue statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
