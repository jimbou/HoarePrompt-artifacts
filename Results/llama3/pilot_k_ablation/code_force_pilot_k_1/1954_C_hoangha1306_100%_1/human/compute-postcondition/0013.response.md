Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the digit at index i of a. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 contains the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b, and vt is set to 1. Otherwise, kq1 contains the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b, kq2 contains the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b.***
