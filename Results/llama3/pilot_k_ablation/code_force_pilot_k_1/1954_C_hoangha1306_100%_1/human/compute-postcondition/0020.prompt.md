You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, where each pair of lines contains two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        kq1 = ''
        
        kq2 = ''
        
        vt = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        
        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin is empty, q is t, a and b are empty strings, kq1 and kq2 are empty strings, vt is 0 if all pairs of corresponding digits in all pairs of input strings are equal, and vt is 1 if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in any pair of input strings that are not equal, and 2t strings have been printed, each string containing the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if all pairs of corresponding digits in that pair are equal, and the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in that pair that are not equal, and the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if all pairs of corresponding digits in that pair are equal, and the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in that pair that are not equal.

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin is empty, q is t, a and b are empty strings, kq1 and kq2 are empty strings, vt is 0 if all pairs of corresponding digits in all pairs of input strings are equal, and vt is 1 if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in any pair of input strings that are not equal, and 2t strings have been printed, each string containing the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if all pairs of corresponding digits in that pair are equal, and the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in that pair that are not equal, and the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if all pairs of corresponding digits in that pair are equal, and the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a pair of input strings if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in that pair that are not equal.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
