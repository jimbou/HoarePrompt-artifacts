Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the value of `kq2`, which is a string containing alternating maximum and minimum digits from strings `a` and `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are strings of digits from 1 to 9, the minimum digit is 1 and the maximum digit is 9. Therefore, `kq2` will be a string alternating between 9 and 1.

Output: **a string of alternating 9 and 1 (e.g. "919191...")**
