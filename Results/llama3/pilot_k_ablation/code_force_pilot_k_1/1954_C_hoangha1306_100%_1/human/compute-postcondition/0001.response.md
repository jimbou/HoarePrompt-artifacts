According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `q` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length**
