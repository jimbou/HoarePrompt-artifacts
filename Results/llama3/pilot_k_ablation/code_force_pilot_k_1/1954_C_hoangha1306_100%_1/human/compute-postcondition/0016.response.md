Based on the given precondition, the code prints the string `kq1`. The value of `kq1` depends on the value of `vt`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` contains the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` contains the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b`.

Since `vt` is 1 if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` that are not equal, and `vt` is 0 if all pairs of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` are equal, the printed value of `kq1` will be the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` that are not equal, and the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` if all pairs of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` are equal.

Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the digits from a and b, with the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a and b in kq1 if vt is 0, and the larger digit in kq1 if vt is 1, and the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a and b in kq2 if vt is 0, and the smaller digit in kq2 if vt is 1, vt is 1 if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in a and b that are not equal, and vt is 0 if all pairs of corresponding digits in a and b are equal, and kq1 is printed, kq1 (where kq1 is the string containing the larger digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a and b if there is at least one pair of corresponding digits in a and b that are not equal, and the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding digits in a and b if all pairs of corresponding digits in a and b are equal)**
