Postcondition: **t is at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of string a and the integer at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of string a and the integer at index i of string b, and the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string containing the minimum of the integer at index i of string a and the integer at index i of string b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum of the integer at index i of string a and the integer at index i of string b, and vt is 1. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the maximum of the integer at index i of string a and the integer at index i of string b, kq2 is a string containing the minimum of the integer at index i of string a and the integer at index i of string b.**
