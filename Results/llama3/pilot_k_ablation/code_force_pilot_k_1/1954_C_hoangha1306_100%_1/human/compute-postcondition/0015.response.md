The code prints the string `kq1` which contains alternating minimum and maximum digits from strings `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are strings of digits from 1 to 9, the minimum digit is 1 and the maximum digit is 9. Therefore, `kq1` will contain alternating 1s and 9s.

Output: **a string of alternating 1s and 9s**
