Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t pairs of strings of digits from 1 to 9. For each pair, it generates two new strings by alternating between the minimum and maximum digits of the pair, and prints these strings. The function repeats this process for all t pairs, leaving the standard input empty and printing the alternating minimum and maximum digit strings for each pair.**
