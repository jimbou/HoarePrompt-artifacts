This function processes a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string s of length n, then counts and prints the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in s using a sliding window of size 3. Additionally, it prints all substrings of length 3 from each string s. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
