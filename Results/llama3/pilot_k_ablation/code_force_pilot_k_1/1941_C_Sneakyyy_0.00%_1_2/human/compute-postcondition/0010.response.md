Postcondition: ***`a` has at least 3 elements, `s` is a list containing the first 3 elements of `a`, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, and the first 3 elements of the list `a` which are in the list `s` are being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
