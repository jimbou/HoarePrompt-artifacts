Output State: **`a` must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a list containing the first 3 elements of `a`, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, and the first 3 elements of the list `a` which are in the list `s` are being printed. Additionally, `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `a`, `s`, and stdin are still valid.
