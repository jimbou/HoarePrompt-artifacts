The `print(ans)` statement will print the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` with a sliding window of size 3.
Since the exact `a` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of 'map' or 'pie' occurrences in `a` with a sliding window of size 3.
Output: **ans (where ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a with a sliding window of size 3)**
