To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input from `stdin` must contain at least 1 test case and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
