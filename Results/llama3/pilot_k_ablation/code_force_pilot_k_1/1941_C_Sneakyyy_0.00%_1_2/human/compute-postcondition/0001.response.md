The code snippet provided reads a line from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `a`. It then initializes two variables, `ans` and `i`, to 0.

After executing the code, the variable `a` will hold the value of the first line of input from stdin. The variable `ans` will be 0, and the variable `i` will also be 0. Stdin will contain at least 1 fewer test case than initially.

Output State: **a is the first line of input from stdin, ans is 0, i is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially.**
