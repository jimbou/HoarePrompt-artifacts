Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "mapmap", the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. This is because the program increments the index `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie", but it does not check if the next character is also part of the same substring.

In this case, the program will count the second "map" as a separate substring, when in fact it is part of the same substring as the first "map". Therefore, the program will output 2 instead of 1.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check if the next character is also part of the same substring before incrementing the index `i`.
