stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n and k are positive integers such that k <= n. q is a positive integer. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
