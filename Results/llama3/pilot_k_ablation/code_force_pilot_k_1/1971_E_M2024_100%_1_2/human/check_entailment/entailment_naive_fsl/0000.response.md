Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It first calculates the distances and times between each pair of adjacent signs, then uses binary search to find the appropriate interval for each query. The time is then calculated by adding the time taken to reach the start of the interval and the time taken to cover the remaining distance within the interval.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the query point is at the start or end of an interval, or where the query point is at a sign. The use of binary search ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large inputs.

I have not been able to find any case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
