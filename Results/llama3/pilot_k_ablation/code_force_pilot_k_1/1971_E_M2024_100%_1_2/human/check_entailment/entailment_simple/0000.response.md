Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, and then reads the `k` integers for the positions `a` and the times `b`.

3. It calculates the differences between consecutive positions `ad` and times `bd`, and then calculates the speeds `v` for each segment.

4. For each query, it uses binary search to find the segment that the query position `ql` belongs to. If the query position is exactly at a known position, it prints the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time by adding the time of the previous segment and the time taken to cover the remaining distance in the current segment.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the query position is exactly at a known position, and it correctly calculates the time for other query positions.

6. The program uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to perform binary search, which is efficient for large inputs.

7. The program correctly prints the results for each query, and it prints the results for each test case on a new line.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
