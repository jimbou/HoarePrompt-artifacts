Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the data, and prints the results. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input, including the number of test cases, the number of points, and the query points.
2.  It initializes the necessary lists to store the input points, their differences, and the velocities.
3.  The program calculates the differences between consecutive points in the `a` and `b` lists and stores them in the `ad` and `bd` lists, respectively.
4.  It calculates the velocities by dividing the differences in `ad` by the differences in `bd` and stores them in the `v` list.
5.  For each query point, the program uses binary search to find the index of the point in the `a` list that is closest to the query point.
6.  If the query point is exactly equal to a point in the `a` list, the program prints the corresponding time from the `b` list.
7.  Otherwise, the program calculates the interpolated time by adding the time at the previous point to the product of the velocity and the difference between the query point and the previous point.
8.  The program prints the calculated time for each query point.

Correctness: **True**
