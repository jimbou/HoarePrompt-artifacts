Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is 0, a is a list of integers with length at least 2, b is a list of integers with length at least 2, ad is a list with k+1 elements: 0 and a[i] - a[i - 1] for i from 1 to k, bd is a list with len(b) elements: 0 and b[i] - b[i - 1] for i from 1 to len(b)-1, stdin contains no more test cases, i is len(a)-1, v is a list with len(a) elements: 0 and ad[i] / bd[i] for i from 1 to len(a)-1, l is q, ql is the last integer read from stdin, s is an integer index in a where ql should be inserted to maintain sorted order, m is an integer equal to b[s - 1] plus b[s] - b[s - 1] times ql minus a[s] divided by a[s] - a[s - 1], and m is printed for each of the q test cases.**
