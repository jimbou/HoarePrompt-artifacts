To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(b)` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(b)`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to have a length of at least 2.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `ad` is a list with `k+1` elements: 0 and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `k`, `bd` is a list with a single element 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases, `i` is 1**
