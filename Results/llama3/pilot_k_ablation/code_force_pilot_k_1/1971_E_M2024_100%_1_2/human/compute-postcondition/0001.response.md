To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains the rest of the first test case (three lines) and all subsequent test cases**
