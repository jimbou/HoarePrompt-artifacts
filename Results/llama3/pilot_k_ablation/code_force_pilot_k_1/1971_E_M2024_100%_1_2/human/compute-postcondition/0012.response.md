Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `ad` is a list with `k+1` elements: 0 and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `k`, `bd` is a list with `len(b)` elements: 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `len(b)-1`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases, `i` is `len(a)-1`, `v` is a list with `len(a)` elements: 0 and `ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` from 1 to `len(a)-1`.**
