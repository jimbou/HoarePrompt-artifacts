Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with length at least 2, b is a list of integers with length at least 2, ad is a list with k+1 elements: 0 and a[i] - a[i - 1] for i from 1 to k, bd is a list with len(b) elements: 0 and b[i] - b[i - 1] for i from 1 to len(b)-1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus one integer, i is 1, v is a list with len(a) elements: 0 and ad[i] / bd[i] for i from 1 to len(a)-1, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer index in a where ql should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and the value of b[s] is being printed, where s is the index in a where ql should be inserted to maintain sorted order and the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values and properties.
