Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines, and for each test case, it calculates and prints the interpolated values of a function defined by two sets of points (a and b) at given query points (q). The function assumes that the input points in a and b are sorted in ascending order and that the query points are within the range of the input points. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and all variables are reset to their initial state.**
