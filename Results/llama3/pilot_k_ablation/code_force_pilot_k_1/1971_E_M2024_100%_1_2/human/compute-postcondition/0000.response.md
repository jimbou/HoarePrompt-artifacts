The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `q`. However, only the first integer `t` is read and assigned to the variable `t`.

The value of `t` is the number of test cases.

The remaining input in stdin is still valid, containing the rest of the first test case (three lines) and all subsequent test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the rest of the first test case (three lines) and all subsequent test cases.**
