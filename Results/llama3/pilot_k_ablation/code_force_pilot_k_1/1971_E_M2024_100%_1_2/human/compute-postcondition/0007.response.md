Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `ad` is a list with `k+1` elements: 0 and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `k`, `bd` is a list with two elements: 0 and `b[1] - b[0]`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated to include the difference between the first two elements of list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
