Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `ad` is a list with `k+1` elements: 0 and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `k`, `bd` is a list with `len(b)` elements: 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `len(b)-1`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases, `i` is 1, `v` is a list with two elements: 0 and `ad[1] / bd[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of the division of `ad[1]` by `bd[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
