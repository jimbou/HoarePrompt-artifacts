stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases is a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) which is given in the first line of stdin.
