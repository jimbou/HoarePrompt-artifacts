Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` space-separated integers from the second input, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the rest are zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: a single integer and `n` space-separated integers, `i` is `n`, the current value of `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` and has a 1 at the jth bit position (i.e., `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position when shifted right by `j` and ANDed with 1), and `j` is within the range of 32.**
