Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `prefix` is a list where each element at index i (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the i-th element in arr and the previous element in prefix, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the first list is 1 and the rest are 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in the first element of the first list in `pre` being 1, while the rest of the elements in `pre` and all elements in `suf` remain 0. The values of `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `stdin` are unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0.
