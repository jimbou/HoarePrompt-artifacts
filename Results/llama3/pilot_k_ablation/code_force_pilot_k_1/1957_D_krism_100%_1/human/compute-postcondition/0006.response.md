Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` space-separated integers from the second input, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists each containing two elements where the first element of the first list is 1 and the rest are zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: a single integer and `n` space-separated integers, `i` is 0, `32` is a positive integer**

In this output state, the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `pre[i][0]` being 1 and the rest of the elements in `pre` remaining zeros. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
