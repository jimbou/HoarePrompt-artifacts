Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer 'n' and a list of 'n' positive integers. It calculates the sum of the products of corresponding elements from two lists, 'pre' and 'suf', at index 'k' for all elements in the list. The lists 'pre' and 'suf' are updated based on the bitwise XOR operation between the elements in the list and their previous elements. The function prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
