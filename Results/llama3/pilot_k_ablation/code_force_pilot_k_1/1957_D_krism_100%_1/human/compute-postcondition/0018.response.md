Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` space-separated integers from the second input, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the rest are zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where each list contains two elements: the first element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in `prefix` (excluding the first element) is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in `prefix` (excluding the first element) is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: a single integer and `n` space-separated integers, `i` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `n-1`, `j` is 32, and `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` initialized to 0. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
