Output: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` space-separated integers from the second input, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists each containing two elements where the first element of each list is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in `prefix` (excluding the first element) is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in `prefix` (excluding the first element) is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where each list contains two elements: the first element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in `prefix` (excluding the first element) is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in `prefix` (excluding the first element) is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: a single integer and `n` space-separated integers, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `n-1`, `j` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the products of the number of times each bit is 0 and 1 in `prefix` (excluding the first element) and the corresponding counts in `pre` and `suf`, `y` is the last element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is the last element of `prefix`, and the sum of the products of the number of times each bit is 0 and 1 in `prefix` (excluding the first element) and the corresponding counts in `pre` and `suf` which is ans is being printed**
