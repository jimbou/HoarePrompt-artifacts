Output State: **n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of positive integers, prefix is a list where each element at index i (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the i-th element in arr and the previous element in prefix, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix is 0 minus the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix is 1 minus the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, cur is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the 1st element in arr and the previous element in prefix (which is 0), j is 32, ans is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from pre and suf at index k, y is the 1st element in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the 1st element in prefix.**
