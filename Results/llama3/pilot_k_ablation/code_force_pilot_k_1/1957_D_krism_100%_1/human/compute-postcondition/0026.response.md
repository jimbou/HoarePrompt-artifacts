Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of n space-separated integers from the second input, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements where each element at index i is the XOR of all elements in arr up to index i, pre is a list of 32 lists each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the rest are zeros except for the jth list which is [1,1] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise [2,1], suf is a list of 32 lists where each list contains two elements: the first element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix (excluding the first element) is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix (excluding the first element) is 1 except for the jth list which is [number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix (excluding the first element) is 0 minus 1, number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix (excluding the first element) is 1] if the jth bit of c is 1, otherwise [number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix (excluding the first element) is 0 minus 1, number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix (excluding the first element) is 1], stdin contains t-3 lines of input: a single integer and n space-separated integers, i is 1, cur is the XOR of all elements in arr up to index n-1, j is between 0 and 31 (inclusive), ans is pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], y is the ith element of arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the ith element of prefix.***
