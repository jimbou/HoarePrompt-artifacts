Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a list of n space-separated integers from the second input, prefix is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: a single integer and n space-separated integers**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is the first input integer, and the list `arr` contains the `n` space-separated integers from the second input. The list `prefix` is initialized with a single element, 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each consisting of a single integer and `n` space-separated integers.
