Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `prefix` is a list where each element at index `i` (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix is 0 and the second element is the number of times the jth bit of all elements in prefix is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `j` is 32, `ans` is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `pre` and `suf` at index `k` for all elements in `arr`, `y` is the last element in `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is the last element in `prefix`.**
