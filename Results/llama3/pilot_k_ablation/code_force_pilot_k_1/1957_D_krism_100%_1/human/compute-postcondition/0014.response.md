Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` space-separated integers from the second input, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the rest are zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the jth list contains two elements: the first element is 1 and the second element is 0 except for the jth list which contains two elements: the first element is 2 and the second element is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: a single integer and `n` space-separated integers, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the XOR of all elements in `arr`, `j` is within the range of 32, and the jth bit of `cur` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 2, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
