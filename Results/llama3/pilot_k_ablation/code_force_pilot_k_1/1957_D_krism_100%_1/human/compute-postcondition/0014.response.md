Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least `i`, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `prefix` is a list where each element at index `i` (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the jth list is 1 and the second element is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is at least 1, `cur` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `j` is at least 0 and at most 31. The jth bit of cur is 0**

The code increments the first element of the jth list in `suf` by 1. Since the jth bit of `cur` is 0, this increment operation does not affect the other variables. The values of `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `stdin`, `i`, `cur`, and `j` remain unchanged.
