Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least `i`, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `prefix` is a list where each element at index `i` (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1 for the j-th index and 0 for the rest, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is at least 1, `cur` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `j` is at least 0 and at most 31. The current value of `cur` has a 1 in the j-th bit position (i.e., `cur` bitwise right shift `j` and bitwise AND with 1 is 1).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suf[j][1]` is now 1, indicating that the j-th bit position of `cur` is 1.
