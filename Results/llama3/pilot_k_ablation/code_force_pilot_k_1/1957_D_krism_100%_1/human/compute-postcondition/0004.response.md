Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers, prefix is a list where each element at index i (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the i-th element in arr and the previous element in prefix, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code initializes two new lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists, each of which contains two elements initialized to 0. The initial state of `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `stdin` remains unchanged.
