Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `prefix` is a list containing two elements: 0 and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the first element in the list `v` and 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `v` is the first element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `prefix` has been updated to include a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the first element in the list `v` and the last element in the `prefix` list (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
