To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and the range `32`. Since `i` is the loop variable and `32` is the upper limit of the range, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` space-separated integers from the second input, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: a single integer and `n` space-separated integers, `i` is 0, `32` is a positive integer**
