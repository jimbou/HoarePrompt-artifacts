The code prints the sum of the products of the number of times each bit is 0 and 1 in `prefix` (excluding the first element) and the corresponding counts in `pre` and `suf`. This sum is calculated based on the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `n-1`, the number of times each bit is 0 and 1 in `prefix` (excluding the first element), and the corresponding counts in `pre` and `suf`.

Output: **sum of products of bit counts (where bit counts are the number of times each bit is 0 and 1 in prefix excluding the first element, and the corresponding counts in pre and suf)**
