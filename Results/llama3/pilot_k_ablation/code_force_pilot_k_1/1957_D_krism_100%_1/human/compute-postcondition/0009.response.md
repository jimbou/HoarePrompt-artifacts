Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least `i`, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `prefix` is a list where each element at index `i` (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is at least 1, `cur` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the `i`-th element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`, which is the same as the `i`-th element in `prefix`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
