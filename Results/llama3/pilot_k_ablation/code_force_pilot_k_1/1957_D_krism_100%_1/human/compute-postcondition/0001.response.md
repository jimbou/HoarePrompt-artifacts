According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and `v` is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `prefix` is a list containing a single element 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `v` is the first element in the list**
