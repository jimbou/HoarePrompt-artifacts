Output State: **n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of positive integers, prefix is a list where each element at index i (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the i-th element in arr and the previous element in prefix, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the second element is 0, except for the j-th list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is the number of times the j-th bit of all elements in prefix is 0 minus 1 and the second element is the number of times the j-th bit of all elements in prefix is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, cur is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the 1st element in arr and the previous element in prefix (which is 0), j is at least 0 and at most 31, ans is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from pre and suf at index k, y is the 1st element in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the 1st element in prefix, and the j-th bit of c is 0**

The code modifies the `pre` and `suf` lists. The `pre` list now has the first element of the `j`-th list incremented by 1, making it 2, and the second element remains 0. The `suf` list now has the first element of each list decremented by 1, reflecting the change in the number of times the `j`-th bit of all elements in `prefix` is 0. No other variables are affected.
