Output State: **n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of positive integers, prefix is a list where each element at index i (starting from 1) is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the i-th element in arr and the previous element in prefix, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of each list is 1 and the second element is 1 at index j and 0 at all other indices, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is the number of times the j-th bit of all elements in prefix is 0 and the second element is the number of times the j-th bit of all elements in prefix is 1 minus 1 at index j, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, cur is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the 1st element in arr and the previous element in prefix (which is 0), j is at least 0 and at most 31, ans is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from pre and suf at index k, y is the 1st element in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the 1st element in prefix. The current value of c has a bit at position j that is 1.**
