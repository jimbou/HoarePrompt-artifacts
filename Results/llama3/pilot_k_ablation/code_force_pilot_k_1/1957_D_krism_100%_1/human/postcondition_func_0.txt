This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the sum of products of bit counts. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with the first line containing an integer t, followed by t lines containing a single integer n, and then n lines containing n space-separated integers. The function calculates the XOR of all elements in each line, and then calculates the sum of products of bit counts for each bit position. The bit counts are calculated based on the number of times each bit is 0 or 1 in the XOR values. The function prints the final sum of products of bit counts.
