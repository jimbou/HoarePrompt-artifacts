Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. It first finds the start and end indices of the block of chips by skipping the leading and trailing zeros. Then, it counts the number of zeros within this block, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When there are no free cells between the chips (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
* When there are free cells between the chips (e.g., [1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
* When there are leading or trailing zeros (e.g., [0, 1, 1, 1, 0])
* When there is only one chip (e.g., [1])

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
