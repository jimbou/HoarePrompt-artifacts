Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `length` and the array `arrs` itself.

3. It then finds the start index `sIdx` of the first chip (1) in the array by iterating from the start of the array until it finds a 1.

4. It finds the end index `eIdx` of the last chip (1) in the array by iterating from the end of the array until it finds a 1.

5. It then counts the number of free cells (0) between the start and end indices (inclusive) and stores this count in `cnt0`.

6. Finally, it prints the count of free cells `cnt0`, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no chips in the array (in which case `sIdx` and `eIdx` will be equal to `length` and 0 respectively, and `cnt0` will be 0) and where there are no free cells between the chips (in which case `cnt0` will be 0).

Correctness: **True**
