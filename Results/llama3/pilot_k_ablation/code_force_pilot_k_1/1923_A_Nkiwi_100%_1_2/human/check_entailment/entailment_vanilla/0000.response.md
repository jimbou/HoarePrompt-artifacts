Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program takes the number of test cases, the length of the ribbon, and the state of each cell (0 for free or 1 for chip) as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the ribbon (`length`) and the state of each cell (`arrs`).

3. It then finds the start index (`sIdx`) of the first chip by iterating from the left until it finds a cell with a chip (value 1). If all cells are free (value 0), `sIdx` will remain 0.

4. Similarly, it finds the end index (`eIdx`) of the last chip by iterating from the right until it finds a cell with a chip. If all cells are free, `eIdx` will remain at the last index of the array.

5. The program then counts the number of free cells (`cnt0`) between the start and end indices (inclusive) by iterating over the range and incrementing the count whenever it encounters a free cell (value 0).

6. Finally, it prints the count of free cells (`cnt0`), which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately identifies the start and end indices of the chips and counts the free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required is indeed equal to the number of free cells between the chips, as each free cell needs to be filled by moving a chip to its left.

Correctness: **True**
