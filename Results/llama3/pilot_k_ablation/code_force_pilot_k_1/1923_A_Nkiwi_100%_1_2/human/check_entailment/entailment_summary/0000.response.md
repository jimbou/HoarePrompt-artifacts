Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the ribbon (`length`) and the array of cells (`arrs`).
3. It then finds the indices of the first and last cells containing chips (`sIdx` and `eIdx`) by skipping leading and trailing free cells.
4. Finally, it counts the number of free cells (`cnt0`) within the range of cells containing chips (from `sIdx` to `eIdx`) and prints this count.

The program's logic is sound because:

* It correctly identifies the range of cells containing chips by finding the first and last non-zero elements in the array.
* It accurately counts the number of free cells within this range, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and printing the correct count of free cells for each case.

Correctness: **True**
