Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of each test case, and the array of cells for each test case.

2. It correctly identifies the start and end indices of the range of cells containing chips by skipping leading and trailing free cells.

3. It then counts the number of free cells within this range, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

4. The program prints the count of free cells for each test case, which is the desired output.

5. The program does not modify the input or store any results, only printing the count of free cells for each test case, as required.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
