Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than or equal to 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than `eIdx + 1`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx - 1`, `i` is `sIdx`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0. `stdin` contains no input.***
