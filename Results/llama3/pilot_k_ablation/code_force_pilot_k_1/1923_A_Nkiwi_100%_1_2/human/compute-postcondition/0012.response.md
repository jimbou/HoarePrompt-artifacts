Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than or equal to 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than `eIdx + 1`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx - 1`, `i` is `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `arrs[i]` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `arrs[i]` is still 0, and all other conditions on the variables are still valid.
