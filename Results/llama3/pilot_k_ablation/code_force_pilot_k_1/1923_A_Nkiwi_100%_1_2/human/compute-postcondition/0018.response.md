Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of free cells (containing 0) between the first and last cells containing chips (containing 1) in each test case. It iterates through the input, skipping leading and trailing free cells, and then counts the free cells within the range of cells containing chips. The function does not modify the input or store any results, only printing the count of free cells for each test case.**
