To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
