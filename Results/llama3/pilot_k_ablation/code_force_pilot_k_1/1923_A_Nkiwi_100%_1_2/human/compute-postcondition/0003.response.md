To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states accordingly. The loop head contains two conditions: `sIdx < length` and `arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

1. **Condition 1: `sIdx < length`**

   - Right before the loop, `sIdx` is 0, and `length` is an integer.
   - For this condition to be true, `length` must be greater than 0 since `sIdx` is 0.

2. **Condition 2: `arrs[sIdx] == 0`**

   - Right before the loop, `sIdx` is 0, and `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - For this condition to be true, the first element of `arrs` (at index 0) must be 0.

Given these conditions, the states that need adjustment are `length` and the first element of `arrs`.

- `length` must be greater than 0.
- The first element of `arrs` must be 0.

Other variables like `t`, `_`, `eIdx`, and the state of `stdin` do not affect the loop's ability to execute the first iteration based on the conditions in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `stdin` contains no input**
