Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than or equal to 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the last element is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `stdin` contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
