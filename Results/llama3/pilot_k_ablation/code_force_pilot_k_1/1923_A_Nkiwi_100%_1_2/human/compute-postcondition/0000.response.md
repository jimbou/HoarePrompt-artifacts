Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which was read from the input. The rest of the input remains the same, with `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The values of `n` and `a_i` are still constrained by the initial state, but the value of `t` is now fixed.
