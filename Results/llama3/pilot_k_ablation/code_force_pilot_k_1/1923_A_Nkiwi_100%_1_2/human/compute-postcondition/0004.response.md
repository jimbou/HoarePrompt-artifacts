Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The precondition that `sIdx` was 0 is no longer valid, but all other preconditions are still valid.
