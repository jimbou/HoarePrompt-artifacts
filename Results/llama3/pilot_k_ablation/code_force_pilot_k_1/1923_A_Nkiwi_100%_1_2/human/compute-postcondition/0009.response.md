Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than or equal to 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` or -1 if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `cnt0` is 0, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `cnt0` is introduced with a value of 0. The stdin remains empty, containing no input.
