To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

1. `eIdx >= 0`: This condition is already guaranteed by the state before the loop, as `eIdx` is set to `length - 1`, and `length` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `eIdx` will always be greater than or equal to 0 when `length` is 0 or more.

2. `arrs[eIdx] == 0`: For this condition to be true, the element at index `eIdx` in `arrs` must be 0. Since `eIdx` is `length - 1`, we need to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0.

Given these conditions, the only state that needs adjustment is the state of `arrs`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `length` must be greater than or equal to 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the last element is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `stdin` contains no input**
