#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        sIdx = 0
        
        eIdx = length - 1
        
        while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
            sIdx += 1
        
        while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
            eIdx -= 1
        
        cnt0 = 0
        
        for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        
        print(cnt0)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` must be 0, `_` is `t`, `length` is undefined, `arrs` is undefined, `sIdx` is undefined, `eIdx` is undefined, `cnt0` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of free cells (containing 0) between the first and last cells containing chips (containing 1) in each test case. It iterates through the input, skipping leading and trailing free cells, and then counts the free cells within the range of cells containing chips. The function does not modify the input or store any results, only printing the count of free cells for each test case.
