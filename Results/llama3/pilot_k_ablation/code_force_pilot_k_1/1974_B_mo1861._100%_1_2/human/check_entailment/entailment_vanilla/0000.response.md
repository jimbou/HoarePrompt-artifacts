Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a string of distinct letters in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of each encoded string, and the encoded strings themselves.

2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program correctly creates a string `r` of distinct characters from the encoded string, sorted in alphabetical order.

4. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`.

5. The program then uses the `char_map` to decode the encoded string by replacing each character with its symmetric character.

6. Finally, the program appends the decoded string to the `results` list and prints all the decoded strings after processing all test cases.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
