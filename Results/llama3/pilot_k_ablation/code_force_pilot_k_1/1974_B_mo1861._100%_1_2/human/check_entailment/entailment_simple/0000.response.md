Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The function first creates a string `r` of unique characters in the encoded string, in sorted order. This is done by converting the encoded string to a set (which removes duplicates), sorting the set, and then joining the characters back into a string.

2. Then, it creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`. This is done using a dictionary comprehension.

3. Finally, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`, using the `char_map`. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` function.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string has duplicate characters, because the `set` function removes duplicates when creating the string `r`. It also correctly handles the case where the input string has characters that are not in the string `r`, because the `char_map` will not contain those characters, and the `join` function will simply ignore them.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
