Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly constructs the string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is done by using the `set` function to remove duplicates, sorting the characters using the `sorted` function, and then joining them into a string using the `join` function.

2. The program correctly creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding character in the reversed string `r`. This is done by using a dictionary comprehension to create a mapping between each character and its corresponding character in the reversed string.

3. The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character in the reversed string `r` using the `char_map`. This is done by using a generator expression to iterate over each character in the encoded string, replacing it with its corresponding character in the reversed string, and then joining the resulting characters into a decoded string.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the input string contains duplicate characters, as the `set` function removes duplicates when constructing the string `r`.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the input string contains characters that are not in the string `r`, as the `char_map` will not contain a mapping for such characters, and the program will raise a `KeyError` in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
