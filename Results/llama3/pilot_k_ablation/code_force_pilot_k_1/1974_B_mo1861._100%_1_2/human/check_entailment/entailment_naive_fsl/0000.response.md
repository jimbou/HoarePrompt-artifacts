Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string `encoded` and sorts them in alphabetical order to form the string `r`.
2. It then creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).
3. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `encoded` by replacing each character with its symmetric character.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* It correctly handles strings with duplicate characters, as the `set` data structure is used to extract unique characters.
* It correctly handles strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order, as the `sorted` function is used to sort the unique characters.
* It correctly handles strings with characters that are not lowercase Latin letters, as the problem statement guarantees that the input string only contains lowercase Latin letters.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty input string (although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, the program will correctly handle it by returning an empty string).
* A single-character input string (the program will correctly return the same character).

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
