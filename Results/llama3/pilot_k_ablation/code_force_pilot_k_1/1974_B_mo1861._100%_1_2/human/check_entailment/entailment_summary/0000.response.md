Reasoning:
The provided program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t` and the encoded strings `b`.
2.  For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b` itself.
3.  The `func_1` function is then called with the encoded string `b` as an argument.
4.  Within `func_1`, it first creates a sorted string `r` of unique characters from the encoded string `b`. This string `r` is used to map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the decoded string.
5.  A dictionary `char_map` is created to store the mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the decoded string. This is done by iterating over the characters in the sorted string `r` and mapping each character to its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`.
6.  Finally, the program uses the `char_map` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character in the decoded string, effectively decoding the input string.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, replacing each character in the input string with its corresponding character in a sorted string of unique characters from the input in reverse order.

Correctness: **True**
