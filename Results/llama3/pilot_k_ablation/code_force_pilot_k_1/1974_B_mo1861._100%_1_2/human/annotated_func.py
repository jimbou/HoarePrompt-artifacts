#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string 'decoded' that is obtained by replacing each character in 'encoded' with its corresponding character in 'r' in reverse order, where 'r' is a string of unique characters in 'encoded' in sorted order, and 'encoded' is a string of lowercase Latin letters.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters as input, replaces each character with its corresponding character in a sorted string of unique characters from the input in reverse order, and returns the resulting decoded string.
