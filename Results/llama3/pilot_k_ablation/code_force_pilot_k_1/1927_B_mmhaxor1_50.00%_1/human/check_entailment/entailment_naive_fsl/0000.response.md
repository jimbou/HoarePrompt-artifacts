Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains a value greater than or equal to 27. In this case, the program will try to access an index in the string 'sam' that does not exist, resulting in an "IndexError: string index out of range" error.

For example, if the input array is [0, 0, 0, 27], the program will try to access 'sam[27]', which does not exist, causing the error.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that the value of 'a_map[a[i]]' is less than 27 before trying to access 'sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]'.
