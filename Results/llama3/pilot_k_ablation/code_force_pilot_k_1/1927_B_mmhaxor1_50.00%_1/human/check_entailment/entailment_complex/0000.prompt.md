Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, a)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i.
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: (0) for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and all values are the frequency of each number in a, res is a string consisting of n characters where each character is the corresponding character in sam for each number in a, based on the frequency of each number in a.
    return res
    #The program returns a string 'res' consisting of n characters where each character is the corresponding character in 'sam' for each number in 'a', based on the frequency of each number in 'a'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers as input, where each integer in `a` is less than `n`. It returns a string `res` of length `n`, where each character in `res` corresponds to a character in the alphabet string `sam`, based on the frequency of each number in `a`. The function effectively maps each number in `a` to a character in `sam` based on its frequency, and returns the resulting string.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
