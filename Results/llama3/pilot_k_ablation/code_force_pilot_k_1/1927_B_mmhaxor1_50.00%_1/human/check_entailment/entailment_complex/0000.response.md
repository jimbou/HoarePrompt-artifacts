Reasoning:

The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers as input, where each integer in `a` is less than `n`. It returns a string `res` of length `n`, where each character in `res` corresponds to a character in the alphabet string `sam`, based on the frequency of each number in `a`.

The function uses a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the frequency of each number in `a`. For each number `a[i]` in `a`, it finds the corresponding character in `sam` by using the modulo operator (`% 27`) to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the alphabet string. It then increments the frequency of `a[i]` in `a_map` by 1.

The function correctly handles the case where a number in `a` has a frequency greater than 26 (the length of the alphabet string), by using the modulo operator to wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet string.

The function also correctly handles the case where a number in `a` has a frequency of 0, by initializing the frequency of each number in `a_map` to 0.

Overall, the function correctly maps each number in `a` to a character in `sam` based on its frequency, and returns the resulting string.

Correctness: **True**
