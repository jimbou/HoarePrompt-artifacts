    #State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, for each integer i in a, 0 <= i < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and the value at each key k is the number of times k appears in a, res is a string of length n where each character is the kth letter of sam where k is the number of times the corresponding integer appears in a.
    return res
    #The program returns a string 'res' of length n, where each character is the kth letter of the alphabet string 'sam', and k is the number of times the corresponding integer appears in list 'a'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a string of length n, where each character corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of a specific integer in the input list 'a'. The characters are selected from the alphabet string 'sam', with the kth character representing the kth occurrence of an integer in 'a'. The function takes a positive integer 'n' and a list 'a' of 'n' non-negative integers as input and returns the generated string 'res'.
