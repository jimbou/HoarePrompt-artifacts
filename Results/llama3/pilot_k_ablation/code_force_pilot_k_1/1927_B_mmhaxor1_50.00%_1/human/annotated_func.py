#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i.

    #State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and all values are the frequency of each number in a, res is a string consisting of n characters where each character is the corresponding character in sam for each number in a, based on the frequency of each number in a.
    return res
    #The program returns a string 'res' consisting of n characters where each character is the corresponding character in 'sam' for each number in 'a', based on the frequency of each number in 'a'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers as input, where each integer in `a` is less than `n`. It returns a string `res` of length `n`, where each character in `res` corresponds to a character in the alphabet string `sam`, based on the frequency of each number in `a`. The function effectively maps each number in `a` to a character in `sam` based on its frequency, and returns the resulting string.
