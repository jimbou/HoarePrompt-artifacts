This function takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers as input, where each integer in `a` is less than `n`. It returns a string `res` of length `n`, where each character in `res` corresponds to a character in the alphabet string `sam`, based on the frequency of each number in `a`. The function effectively maps each number in `a` to a character in `sam` based on its frequency, and returns the resulting string.
