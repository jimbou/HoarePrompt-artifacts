To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, we need to initialize `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and all values are 0, `res` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
