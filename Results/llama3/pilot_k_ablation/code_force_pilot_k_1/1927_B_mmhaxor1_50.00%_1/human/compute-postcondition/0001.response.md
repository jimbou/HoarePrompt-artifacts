To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, we can infer that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 0, as it will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers, for each integer i in a, 0 <= i < n, `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and all values are 0, `res` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
