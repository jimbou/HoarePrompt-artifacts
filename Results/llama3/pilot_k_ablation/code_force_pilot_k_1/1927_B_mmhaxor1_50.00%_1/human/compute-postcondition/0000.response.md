Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, for each integer i in a, 0 <= i < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and all values are 0, res is an empty string.**

In this output state, the initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The variable `sam` is assigned a string of lowercase English letters, and `a_map` is created as a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1` (since `n` is a positive integer) and all values are initialized to 0. The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string.
