The code snippet initializes three new variables: `sam`, `a_map`, and `res`. The first line assigns a string of lowercase English letters to `sam`. The second line creates a dictionary `a_map` with keys ranging from 0 to `n-1` (since `n` is a positive integer) and initializes all values to 0. The third line assigns an empty string to `res`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and all values are 0, res is an empty string**
