The code block modifies the values of `beg`, `res`, and `a_map[a[i]]`. Here's the combined effect of all lines:

*   `beg` is assigned the value of `a_map[a[i]]`, which is 0 because `a_map` has all values initialized to 0.
*   `res` is appended with the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in the string `sam`. Since `a_map[a[i]]` is 0, `res` is appended with the character at index 0 in `sam`, which is 'a'.
*   `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers, for each integer i in a, 0 <= i < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and the value at key a[i] is 1 and all other values are 0, res is 'a', i is 0**
