Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive. If idx is even, permutation is an array of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is 1, bottom_v is 2, and top_v is n. If idx is odd, permutation is an array with n as its first element and n-1 zeros, bottom_v is 1, and top_v is n-1. In both cases, stdin is empty.***
