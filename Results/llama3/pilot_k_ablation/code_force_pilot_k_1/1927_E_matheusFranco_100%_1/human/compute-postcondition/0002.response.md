Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line calls a function named `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. Therefore, we will focus on the second line, which decrements the value of `t` by 1.

Initially, `t` is an integer greater than 0. After the second line executes, `t` is decremented by 1, making it an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value of `t` is now either the original value minus 1 or 0, depending on its initial value.

The stdin remains empty, as there are no input operations in the code block.

In summary, the code block modifies the value of `t` by decrementing it by 1, making it an integer greater than or equal to 0, while leaving the stdin unchanged.
