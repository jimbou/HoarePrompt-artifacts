Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calls a function named `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1.

Since `t` is initially a positive integer, decrementing it by 1 will result in a new value that is also a positive integer, but one less than its original value. The value of `t` is updated to reflect this change.

Note that the state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as there are no input operations in the code snippet.
