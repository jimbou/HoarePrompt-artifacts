Functionality: **This function reads two space-separated integers n and k from standard input, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and generates a permutation of n values. It fills every kth index of the permutation with a value, alternating between incrementing from 1 and decrementing from n, and prints the permutation as a string of space-separated values. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the result directly.**
