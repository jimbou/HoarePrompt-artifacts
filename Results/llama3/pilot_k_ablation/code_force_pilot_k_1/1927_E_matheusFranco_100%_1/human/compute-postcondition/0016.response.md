Functionality: **The function takes two space-separated integers n and k as input from stdin, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It generates a permutation of n values, where the values at even indices are in ascending order from 1 to n/2 and the values at odd indices are in descending order from n to n/2 + 1. The function then prints the permutation as a string of space-separated numbers.**
