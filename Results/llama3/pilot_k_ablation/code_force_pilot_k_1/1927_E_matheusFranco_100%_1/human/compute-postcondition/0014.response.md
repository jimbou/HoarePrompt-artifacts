The `print(result)` statement will print a string of space-separated values of the `permutation` list.

Since the `permutation` list contains `n` values, where the values at even indices are in ascending order from 1 to `n/2` and the values at odd indices are in descending order from `n` to `n/2 + 1`, the output will be a sequence of numbers that follow this pattern.

For example, if `n` is 6, the `permutation` list might look like this: `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`. In this case, the output would be: `1 6 2 5 3 4`.

In general, the output will be a string of space-separated numbers that follow the pattern described above, where the exact values depend on the value of `n`.

Output: **a string of space-separated numbers following the pattern of even indices in ascending order from 1 to n/2 and odd indices in descending order from n to n/2 + 1**
