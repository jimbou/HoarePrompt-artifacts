The code prints the string `result` which contains the elements of the `permutation` array separated by spaces.
Since the exact elements of the `permutation` array are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string `result` containing the elements of the `permutation` array separated by spaces.
Output: **the elements of the permutation array separated by spaces**
