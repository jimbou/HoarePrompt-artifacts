Output State: **`permutation` is an array of `n` values where every `k`th index is filled with a value, `idx` is equal to `k`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `bottom_v` is equal to `n/2` plus 1 if `n` is even and `n/2` plus 1 if `n` is odd, `top_v` is equal to `n/2` if `n` is even and `n/2` if `n` is odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code has created a new variable `result` which is a string containing all the elements of the `permutation` array separated by spaces. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` is still empty.
