Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where the values at even indices are in ascending order from 1 to `n/2` and the values at odd indices are in descending order from `n` to `n/2 + 1`, `bottom_v` is `n/2 + 1`, `top_v` is `n/2`, `idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is a multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `n`, `result` is a string of space-separated values of `permutation`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, `idx`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the addition of a new variable `result`, which is a string of space-separated values of `permutation`. The `result` string is created by converting each value in `permutation` to a string and joining them with spaces in between. The stdin remains empty as it was in the initial state.
