Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the input integer from stdin, which is greater than 0. The stdin initially contained one input: an integer greater than 0, but after the code is executed, the input is consumed and stdin is empty.
