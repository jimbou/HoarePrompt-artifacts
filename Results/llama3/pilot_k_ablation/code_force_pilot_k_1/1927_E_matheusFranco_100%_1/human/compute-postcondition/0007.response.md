The code assigns the value of `top_v` to the `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` index of the `permutation` array. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0, the first element of the `permutation` array becomes `n`. The second line decrements `top_v` by 1, making it `n-1`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, permutation is an array with n as its first element and n-1 zeros, bottom_v is 1, top_v is n-1, idx is an odd number, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 0, stdin is empty**
