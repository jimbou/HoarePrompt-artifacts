Output State: **`permutation` is an array of `n` values where every `k`th index is filled with a value, `idx` is equal to `k`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `bottom_v` is equal to `n/2` plus 1 if `n` is even and `n/2` plus 1 if `n` is odd, `top_v` is equal to `n/2` if `n` is even and `n/2` if `n` is odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n`**
