Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where the values at even indices are in ascending order from 1 to `n/2` and the values at odd indices are in descending order from `n` to `n/2 + 1`, `bottom_v` is `n/2 + 1`, `top_v` is `n/2`, `idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is a multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `n`, stdin is empty**
