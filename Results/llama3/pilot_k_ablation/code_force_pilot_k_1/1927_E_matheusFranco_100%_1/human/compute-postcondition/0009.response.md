Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, the first value in `permutation` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, stdin is empty. If `idx` is odd, the `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`-th element in `permutation` is `top_v`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n-1`, `idx` is odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `k` in both cases (when `idx` is even and when `idx` is odd). The other variables remain unchanged.
