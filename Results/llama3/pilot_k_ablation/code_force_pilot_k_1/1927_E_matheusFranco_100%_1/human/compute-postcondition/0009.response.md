Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive. If `idx` is even, `permutation` is an array of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 1, `bottom_v` is 2, and `top_v` is `n`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation` is an array with `n` as its first element and `n-1` zeros, `bottom_v` is 1, and `top_v` is `n-1`. `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`. stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` increased by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin is still empty.
