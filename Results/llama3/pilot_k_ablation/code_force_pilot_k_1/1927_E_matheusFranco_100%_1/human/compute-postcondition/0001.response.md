According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains no input**
