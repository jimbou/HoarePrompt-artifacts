Output State: **`permutation` is an array of `n` values where every `k`th index is filled with a value, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n`, `bottom_v` is equal to `n/2` plus 1 if `n` is even and `n/2` plus 1 if `n` is odd, `top_v` is equal to `n/2` if `n` is even and `n/2` if `n` is odd, `idx` is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The array `permutation` remains unchanged, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still equal to `n`, the values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` are still dependent on whether `n` is even or odd, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `n` and `k` are still within their respective ranges. The `stdin` remains empty.
