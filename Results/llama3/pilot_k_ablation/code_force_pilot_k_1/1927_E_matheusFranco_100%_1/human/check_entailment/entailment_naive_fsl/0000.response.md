Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to construct a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The function `func_1` takes two integers n and k as input and generates a permutation that satisfies the condition.

The program works by initializing an array of length n with zeros and then filling it with values from 1 to n in a specific pattern. The pattern is such that the sum of any continuous segment of length k differs by no more than 1.

The program uses two variables, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to keep track of the current values to be assigned to the permutation array. The `bottom_v` variable starts from 1 and increments by 1, while the `top_v` variable starts from n and decrements by 1.

The program then iterates over the permutation array in chunks of size k, assigning values to each chunk in an alternating pattern. If the current index is even, it assigns the `bottom_v` value to the chunk; otherwise, it assigns the `top_v` value.

The program repeats this process until all chunks have been assigned values, resulting in a k-level permutation.

The function `func_2` simply reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for all possible inputs, and the output matches the expected results.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
