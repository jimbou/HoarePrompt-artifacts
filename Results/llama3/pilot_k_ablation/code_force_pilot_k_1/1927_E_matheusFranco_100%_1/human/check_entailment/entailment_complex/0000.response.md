Reasoning: 
The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is no more than 1.

Function 1 generates a permutation of n values, where the values at even indices are in ascending order from 1 to n/2 and the values at odd indices are in descending order from n to n/2 + 1. This pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k are as evenly distributed as possible, which meets the condition for a k-level permutation.

Function 2 reads a positive integer from standard input and repeatedly calls Function 1 a number of times equal to the input integer. This allows the program to process multiple test cases.

Since Function 1 correctly generates a k-level permutation and Function 2 correctly handles multiple test cases, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
