Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1()` generates a permutation of n values, filling every kth index with a value, alternating between incrementing from 1 and decrementing from n. This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will have a difference of at most 1.

Function `func_2()` executes `func_1()` a specified number of times, as determined by the initial value of the input integer t. This allows the program to handle multiple test cases.

The execution summaries of the functions indicate that they behave as expected. `func_1()` generates a permutation and prints it, while `func_2()` executes `func_1()` the correct number of times.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and it meets the problem description.
