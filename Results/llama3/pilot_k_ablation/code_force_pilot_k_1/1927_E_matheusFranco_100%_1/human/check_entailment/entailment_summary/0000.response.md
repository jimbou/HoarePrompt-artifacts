Reasoning: 
The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1` generates a permutation of n values, where the values at even indices are in ascending order from 1 to n/2 and the values at odd indices are in descending order from n to n/2 + 1. This construction ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1, as required by the problem.

Function `func_2` reads a positive integer from standard input and repeatedly calls `func_1` a number of times equal to the input integer. This allows the program to handle multiple test cases.

Since `func_1` correctly constructs a k-level permutation and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
