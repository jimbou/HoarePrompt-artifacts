Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A permutation is k-level if the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two integers n and k as input, constructs a k-level permutation, and prints it. `func_2` reads the number of test cases t, calls `func_1` t times, and handles the input/output for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:

1.  Initialize an array `permutation` of size n with zeros.
2.  Initialize two pointers, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to 1 and n, respectively.
3.  Iterate over the range from 0 to k (exclusive). For each iteration:
    *   Initialize a variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to the current index.
    *   Iterate over the range from `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to the length of the permutation in increments of k.
    *   For each iteration, if the current index is even, assign the value of `bottom_v` to the permutation at the current index and increment `bottom_v`. Otherwise, assign the value of `top_v` to the permutation at the current index and decrement `top_v`.
4.  Convert the permutation array to a string with spaces in between and print it.

The key insight behind this algorithm is that it constructs the permutation by alternating between assigning values from the bottom (1) and top (n) of the range. This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1, satisfying the k-level permutation condition.

The time complexity of `func_1` is O(n), as it involves iterating over the permutation array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as it requires storing the permutation array.

`func_2` simply reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, handling the input/output accordingly.

In conclusion, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n for the given inputs and handles multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
