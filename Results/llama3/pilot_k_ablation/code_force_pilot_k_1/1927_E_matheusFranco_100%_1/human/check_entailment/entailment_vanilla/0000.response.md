Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input values n and k, constructs the permutation, and prints it. `func_2` reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` t times.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:

1. It initializes an array `permutation` of size n with all elements set to 0.
2. It sets two pointers, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to 1 and n, respectively. These pointers will be used to fill the permutation array.
3. It iterates over the range from 0 to k (exclusive) using the variable `idx`.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by adding `idx` to multiples of k. This index is used to fill the permutation array.
5. If `idx` is even, it assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the permutation array at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and increments `bottom_v`. Otherwise, it assigns the value of `top_v` to the permutation array at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and decrements `top_v`.
6. It increments `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by k and repeats steps 4-5 until `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is no longer less than the length of the permutation array.
7. It increments `idx` by 1 and repeats steps 3-6 until `idx` is no longer less than k.
8. Finally, it constructs a string `result` by joining the elements of the permutation array with spaces and prints it.

The logic behind this construction is to alternate between assigning values from the bottom (1) and top (n) of the range to the permutation array, starting from the first and last positions, respectively. This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1.

The time complexity of `func_1` is O(n), as it iterates over the range from 0 to k (exclusive) and fills the permutation array. The space complexity is also O(n), as it creates an array of size n.

`func_2` simply reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` t times, so its time complexity is O(t \* n) and space complexity is O(n).

Overall, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
