Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `n`, `k` is 0, `count` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains two inputs: an integer t and t strings. The relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remains the same.
