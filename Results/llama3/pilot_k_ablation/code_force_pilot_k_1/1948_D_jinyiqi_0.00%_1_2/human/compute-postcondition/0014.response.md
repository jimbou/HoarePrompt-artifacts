Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `count` is either 0 or equal to the length of the longest substring of `s` that is a palindrome and contains at least one question mark, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. If `count` is greater than 0, the function has returned and printed `count * 2`. If `count` is 0, the loop has finished executing without finding a match, and the function has not returned.**
