Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `n`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. Additionally, the character at index k in string s is not equal to the character at index k+j in string s, and neither of these characters is a question mark.***
