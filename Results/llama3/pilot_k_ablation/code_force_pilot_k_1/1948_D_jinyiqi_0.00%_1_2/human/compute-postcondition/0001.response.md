Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `j` is still half of `n`. A new variable `count` is introduced and initialized to 0. The state of the standard input remains the same, containing two inputs: an integer `t` between 1 and 1000, and `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000.
