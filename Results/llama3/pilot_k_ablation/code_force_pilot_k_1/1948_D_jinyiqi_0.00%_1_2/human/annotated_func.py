#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000.
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `count` is either 0 or equal to the length of the longest substring of `s` that is a palindrome and contains at least one question mark, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. If `count` is greater than 0, the function has returned and printed `count * 2`. If `count` is 0, the loop has finished executing without finding a match, and the function has not returned.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string `s` as input and searches for the longest palindromic substring that contains at least one question mark. If such a substring is found, it prints the length of the substring multiplied by 2 and returns. If no such substring is found, it returns 0.
