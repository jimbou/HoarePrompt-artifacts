Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over the possible lengths of the tandem repeat from the longest to the shortest, and for each length, it checks if there is a substring that can be made into a tandem repeat by replacing the question marks. If it finds such a substring, it prints the length of the tandem repeat and returns.

The program correctly handles the case where there are no tandem repeats by returning 0. It also correctly handles the case where the input string is empty or contains only one character.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
