Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the longest tandem repeat substring in a given string by replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters. The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for matching characters or question marks. If a match is found, it prints the length of the match multiplied by 2 and returns. If no match is found, it returns 0.

The program correctly handles the edge case where the input string does not contain any tandem repeat substrings, in which case it returns 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string contains only question marks, in which case it prints the length of the string multiplied by 2.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
