Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. It iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0', which indicates a cut is needed. The program then adds 1 to this count, because the last piece does not need a cut. This logic is correct and covers all possible cases, including the edge cases where the string is already sorted or has only one character.
