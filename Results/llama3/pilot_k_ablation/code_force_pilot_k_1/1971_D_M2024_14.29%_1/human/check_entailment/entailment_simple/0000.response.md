Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating over the input string and counting the number of occurrences of the substring '10'. This is because each occurrence of '10' represents a point where a cut is needed to separate the '1' from the '0' in order to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

The program then prints the total number of cuts needed, which is the count of '10' occurrences plus 1 (because the last piece does not need a cut).

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
