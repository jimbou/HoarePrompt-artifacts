Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` and initializes a variable `cut` to 0.
* It then iterates over the characters in the string, checking if the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'. If this condition is true, it increments the `cut` variable.
* After iterating over the entire string, it prints the value of `cut` plus 1.
* The program repeats this process for all test cases.

The logic behind the program is correct. The minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted string is equal to the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string, plus 1. This is because each occurrence of '1' followed by '0' requires a cut to separate the '1' from the '0', and the final piece will always be a single character (either '0' or '1').

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
