Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `cut` to 0, which will count the number of occurrences of the substring '10' in the string `a`.
4. It iterates over the characters in the string `a`, checking if the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'. If this condition is true, it increments the `cut` variable.
5. After iterating over the entire string, it prints the value of `cut` plus 1.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* The minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string is equal to the number of times the substring '10' appears in the string, plus 1.
* This is because each occurrence of '10' requires a cut to separate the '1' from the '0', and the remaining '0's and '1's can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
* By counting the occurrences of '10' and adding 1, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
