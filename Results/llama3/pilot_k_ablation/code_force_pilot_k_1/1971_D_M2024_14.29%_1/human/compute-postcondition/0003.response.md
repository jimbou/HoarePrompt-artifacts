According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of string a. If the length of a is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 0 and 499, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the length of a must be at least 2 and i is 0.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, cut is 0, _ is 0, i is 0**
