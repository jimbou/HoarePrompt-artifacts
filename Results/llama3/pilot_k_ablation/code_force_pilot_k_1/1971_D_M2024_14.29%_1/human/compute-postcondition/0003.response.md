To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least 2 characters. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have a length of at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `cut` is 0, `i` is 0**
