Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, cut is 1, _ is 0, i is an integer, the current value of i is such that a[i] equals '1' and a[i + 1] equals '0'.**

In this output state, the value of cut has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500. The string a still consists of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2. The variable _ is still 0. The variable i is still an integer, and its current value is such that a[i] equals '1' and a[i + 1] equals '0'.
