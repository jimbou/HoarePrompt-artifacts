The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500. After the code is executed, the integer `t` is removed from the stdin, leaving `t` strings in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500.**
