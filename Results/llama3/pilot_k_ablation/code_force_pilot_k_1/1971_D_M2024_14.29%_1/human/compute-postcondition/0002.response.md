Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, _ is 0, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is 0**

The code reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `a` will be one of these strings. The value of `t` remains unchanged, but the number of strings in stdin decreases by 1. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 0. The variable `cut` is initialized to 0.
