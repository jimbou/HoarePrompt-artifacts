Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is 0, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` is reduced by 1 because one string has been read from stdin. The number of strings in stdin is also reduced by 1. The variable `a` now holds the first string from stdin, which consists of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500. The variable `cut` remains 0, and the variable `_` also remains 0.
