The code prints the value of `cut + 1`, where `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in the string `a`. Since `cut` is calculated based on the string `a`, the printed value will be one more than the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`.

Output: ** `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`, and the value of `cut + 1` (which is one more than the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`) is being printed**
