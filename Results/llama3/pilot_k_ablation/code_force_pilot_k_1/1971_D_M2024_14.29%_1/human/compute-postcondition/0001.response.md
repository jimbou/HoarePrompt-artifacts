To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range of `t`). Since the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `_` is 0**
