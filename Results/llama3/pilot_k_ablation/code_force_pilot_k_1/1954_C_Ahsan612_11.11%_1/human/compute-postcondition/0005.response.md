The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is half the length of `a`, `a` is a list of integers from the first string of digits. `i` being half the length of `a` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than the length of `a`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a list of integers from the first string of digits, `b` is a list of integers from the second string of digits, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, `mid` is half the length of `a`, `i` is less than the length of `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9**
