Output State: **a has at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers, new is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, mid is the middle index of a, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, _ is 0**

In this output state, the first elements of `new` and `new2` have been updated to the maximum and minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
