The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns a string that can be converted to an integer and that integer is at least 1, the loop can execute. So for the loop to be executed  the input() function must return a string that can be converted to an integer and that integer is at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, input() returns a string that can be converted to an integer and that integer is at least 1, _ is 0**
