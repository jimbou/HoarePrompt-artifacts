Output State: **a is a list of integers from the first string of digits, b is a list of integers from the second string of digits, new is a list of integers with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest are None, except for the ith element which is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list of integers with the same length as a, where the first half of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest are None, except for the ith element which is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], mid is half the length of a, i is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the lists `new` and `new2` have been modified at the `i`th index to hold the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
