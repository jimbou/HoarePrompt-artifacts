Output: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `new` is a list of values with the same length as `a` where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of values with the same length as `a` where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `mid` is the middle index of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 0, and the string formed by concatenating the elements of the `new` list is printed, and the string formed by concatenating the elements of the `new2` list is printed**
