The code prints a string of digits, where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits from the first and second strings of digits.
Output: ** `a` is a list of integers from the first string of digits, `b` is a list of integers from the second string of digits, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `mid` is half the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9., and this is printed: a string of digits, where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits from the first and second strings of digits.**
