This function reads input from stdin, processes it in pairs of integers, and prints out the maximum and minimum of each pair. It takes no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly. The function's purpose is to compare pairs of integers and output the maximum and minimum values for each pair. After execution, the stdin is empty, and the function's variables are no longer defined. The function performs the action of comparing and printing the maximum and minimum of input pairs.
