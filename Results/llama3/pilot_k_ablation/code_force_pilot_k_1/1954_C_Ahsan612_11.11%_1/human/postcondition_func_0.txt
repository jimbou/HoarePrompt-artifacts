This function reads input from stdin, where the input consists of an integer t followed by 2t lines of strings of digits. It then compares the corresponding digits from each pair of strings, printing two new strings for each pair: one with the maximum digit at each position in the first half and the minimum digit at each position in the second half, and another with the minimum digit at each position in the first half and the maximum digit at each position in the second half. The function repeats this process t times, emptying the stdin and leaving no residual data in the variables used.
