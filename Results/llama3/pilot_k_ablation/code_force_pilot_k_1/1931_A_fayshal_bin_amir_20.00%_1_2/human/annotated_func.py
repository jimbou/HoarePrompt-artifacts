#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase English letter corresponding to the integer value of num, where num is between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
    #State: num is an integer between 27 and 78 (inclusive)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive) as input and returns a lowercase English letter if the input is between 1 and 26 (inclusive), otherwise it does not return any value for inputs between 27 and 78 (inclusive).
