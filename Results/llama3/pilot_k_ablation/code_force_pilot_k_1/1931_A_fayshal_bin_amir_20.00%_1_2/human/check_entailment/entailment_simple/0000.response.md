Reasoning:

The given program is designed to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by checking the value of the input integer `n` and determining the corresponding letters based on its value.

The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is between 3 and 26, 27 and 52, and 53 and 78. For each case, it calculates the corresponding letters `a`, `b`, and `c` using the `chr` function, which returns the lowercase English letter corresponding to the integer value.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is equal to 3, in which case the output should be "aaa".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
