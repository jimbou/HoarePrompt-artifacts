This function reads a series of integers from standard input, applies a transformation to each integer, and prints the number of steps taken for the transformation along with the transformed values. The transformation involves repeatedly dividing the integer by 2 if it's even or decrementing it by 1 if it's odd, while keeping track of the maximum and minimum values encountered during this process. The function then prints the number of steps taken for each transformation and the sequence of maximum and minimum values in alternating order.
