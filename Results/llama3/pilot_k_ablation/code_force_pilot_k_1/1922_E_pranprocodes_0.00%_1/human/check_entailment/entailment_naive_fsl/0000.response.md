Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input X is 1. According to the problem description, an empty subsequence is also increasing, so there should be an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. It will print 0 as the length of the array, but it should print 1 and the array should contain a single element.

For example, if the input is 1, the program should print:

1
0

But the program does not handle this case correctly.
