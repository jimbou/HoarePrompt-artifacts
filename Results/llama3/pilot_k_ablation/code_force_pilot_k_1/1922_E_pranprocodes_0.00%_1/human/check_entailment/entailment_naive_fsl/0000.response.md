Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when X is 1. According to the problem description, an empty subsequence is also increasing, so when X is 1, the program should return an empty array. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. 

In the given program, when X is 1, the while loop does not execute, and the program prints 0, which is incorrect. The program should print 0 and then an empty line, indicating an empty array. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
