The code prints the elements of the `ans` list in an unpacked manner using the `*` operator. The `ans` list contains the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order. Since `max` is either 100,000,000 or less than 100,000,000, and `min` is either -100,000,000 or greater than -100,000,000, the `ans` list will contain a sequence of these values in alternating order.

Output: **`x` is 1, `max` is either 100,000,000 or less than 100,000,000, `min` is either -100,000,000 or greater than -100,000,000, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order, `t` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` space-separated integers (2 <= X <= 10^18), and the number of times the loop executed which is `t` is being printed, and the elements of the `ans` list are being printed in an unpacked manner, which are the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order**
