Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `max` is either 100,000,000 or 99,999,999, `min` is either -100,000,000 or -99,999,999, `ans` is either a string containing the original value of `max` or '-100,000,000 ', `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` space-separated integers (2 <= X <= 10^18). If `x` is even, `max` is 99,999,999, `min` is -99,999,999, and `ans` is '-100,000,000 '. Otherwise, `max` is 100,000,000, `min` is -100,000,000, and `ans` is a string containing the original value of `max`.***
