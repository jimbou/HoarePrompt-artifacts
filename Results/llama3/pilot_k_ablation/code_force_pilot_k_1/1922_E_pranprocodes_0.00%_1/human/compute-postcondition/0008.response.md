Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `max` is 99,999,999, `min` is -100,000,000, `ans` is either '100,000,000 ' or '-100,000,000 ', `t` is 1, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains a list of integers. If `x` is even, it is halved, otherwise `min` is updated to -99,999,999 and `x` is even**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The stdin still contains a list of integers.
