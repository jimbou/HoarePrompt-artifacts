The `print(*ans)` statement will print the string `ans` as a sequence of space-separated integers.

Since `ans` is a string of space-separated integers starting from `max` and ending at `min`, and `max` is 100,000,000 minus the number of times `x` was even, and `min` is -100,000,000 plus the number of times `x` was odd, we need to determine the values of `max` and `min`.

Given that `x` is 1, which is an odd number, the number of times `x` was even is 0, and the number of times `x` was odd is 1.

Therefore, `max` is 100,000,000 - 0 = 100,000,000, and `min` is -100,000,000 + 1 = -99,999,999.

The string `ans` will contain all integers from `max` to `min`, inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **100,000,000 -99,999,999 (a sequence of space-separated integers starting from 100,000,000 and ending at -99,999,999)**
