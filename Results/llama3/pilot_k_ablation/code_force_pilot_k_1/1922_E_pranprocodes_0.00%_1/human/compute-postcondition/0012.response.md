The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` string, which contains the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order.

Since `max` is either 100,000,000 or less than 100,000,000, and `min` is either -100,000,000 or greater than -100,000,000, the `ans` string will contain a sequence of these values in alternating order.

The number of times the loop executed, which is `t`, is being printed. However, the value of `t` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact number of times the loop executed.

Output: **A sequence of max and min values in alternating order, where max is either 100,000,000 or less than 100,000,000, and min is either -100,000,000 or greater than -100,000,000, repeated t times (where t is the number of times the loop executed)**
