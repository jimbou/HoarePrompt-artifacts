The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order.

The `ans` list contains `len(s)` elements, which are the values of `p` after each iteration. The value of `p` is the product of the elements of the `arr` list at specific indices, modulo `m`.

The indices used to calculate `p` are from `n-1` to `n-1-len(s)` (inclusive) and from `n-1` to `n-1 + count of 'R' in s` (inclusive).

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and the count of 'R' in `s` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `p` and the elements of the `ans` list.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `p` in reverse order, which represent the product of specific elements of the `arr` list, modulo `m`, calculated after each iteration.

Output: **[p1, p2, ..., plen(s)] (where p1, p2, ..., plen(s) are the values of p after each iteration, representing the product of specific elements of the arr list, modulo m)**
