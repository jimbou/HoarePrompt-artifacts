The code prints the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order. The `ans` list contains the products of the original value of `p` and the elements of `arr` at indices `r` and `l` modulo `m` for each character in `s` in reverse order. Since `s` is a string, the products are calculated for each character in the string, and the results are stored in the `ans` list in reverse order.

The `*` operator in the print statement is used to unpack the elements of the `ans` list, so the output will be a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.

Output: **the products of the original value of p and the elements of arr at indices r and l modulo m for each character in s in reverse order**
