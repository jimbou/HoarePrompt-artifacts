Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, k is the first character in the string. If k equals 'L', l is 1 and r is n - 1. If k is not equal to 'L', l is 0 and r is n - 2. In both cases, _ is 0 and stdin is empty.***
