According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the string `s` must have at least 1 character. So for the loop to be executed  the string `s` must have at least 1 character and strr is the last character in the string `s`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R's in `s`, `_` is 0, `p` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `strr` is the last character in the string `s`**
