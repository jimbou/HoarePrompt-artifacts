Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `l` is -len(s) + n - 1, `r` is n - 1 + count of 'R' in s, `p` is the product of arr elements at indices from n-1 to n-1-len(s) (inclusive) and from n-1 to n-1 + count of 'R' in s (inclusive) modulo m, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the values of `p` after each iteration.**
