Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R's in `s`, `_` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the element of `arr` at index `r` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the product of the original value of `p` and the element of `arr` at index `r` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'. All other variables remain unchanged.
