Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is not empty, `l` is either 0 or n - 2, `r` is either n or n - 1, `p` is either arr[n-1] % m or (p * arr[n-2]) % m, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `p` before appending, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the value of `p` before appending. The values of `l`, `r`, and `p` depend on the last character of the string `s`. If the last character is 'R', then `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, and `p` is `arr[n-1] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `p` is `(p * arr[n-2]) % m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
