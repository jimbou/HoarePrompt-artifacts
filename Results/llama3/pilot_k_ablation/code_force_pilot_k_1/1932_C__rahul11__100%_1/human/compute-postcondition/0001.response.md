Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m, respectively. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to arr. The third line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to s. The fourth and fifth lines assign 0 to l and n - 1 to r, respectively. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty since all inputs have been read.
