Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is the first character of `s` and `k` is not 'L'**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `n - 2` because the code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
