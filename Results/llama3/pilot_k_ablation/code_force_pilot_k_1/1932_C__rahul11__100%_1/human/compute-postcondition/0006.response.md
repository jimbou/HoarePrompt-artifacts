The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `r` was `n - 1`, so the new value of `r` is `n - 2`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the first character in the string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and `k` is not equal to 'L'**
