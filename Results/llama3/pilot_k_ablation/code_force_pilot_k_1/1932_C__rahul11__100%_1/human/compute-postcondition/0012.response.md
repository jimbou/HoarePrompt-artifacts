Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, l is equal to the number of 'L's in s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R's in s plus 1, _ is 0, p is equal to the product of the original value of p and the element of arr at index r, modulo m, ans is an empty list, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of its original value and the element of `arr` at index `r`, modulo `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
