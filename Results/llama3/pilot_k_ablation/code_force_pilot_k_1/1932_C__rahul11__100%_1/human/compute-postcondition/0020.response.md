Output State: **stdin is empty, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^4), `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string, `l` is `n`, `r` is -1, `_` is `t`, `p` is 1, `ans` is a list of integers, each being the product of the elements of `arr` at indices `r` and `l` modulo `m` for each character in `s` in reverse order.**
