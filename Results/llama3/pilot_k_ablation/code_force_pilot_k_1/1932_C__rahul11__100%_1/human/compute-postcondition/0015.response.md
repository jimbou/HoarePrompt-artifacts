Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is equal to the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R's in `s`, `_` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the element of `arr` at index `r`, modulo `m`. If the last character of `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr` modulo `m`.***
