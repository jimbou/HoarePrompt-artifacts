Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is not empty, stdin is empty. If the last character in the string s is 'R', then l is 0, r is n, and p is arr[n-1] % m. Otherwise, l is n - 2, r is n - 1, p is the result of (p * arr[n-2]) % m, and ans is an empty list.***
