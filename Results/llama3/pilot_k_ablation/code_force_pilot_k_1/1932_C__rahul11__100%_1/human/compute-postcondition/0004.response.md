Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty, and the first character of `s`, `k`, is 'L'.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
