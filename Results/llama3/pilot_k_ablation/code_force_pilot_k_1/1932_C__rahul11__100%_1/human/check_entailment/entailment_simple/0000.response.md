Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the commands in the string `s` and outputs the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` after each command.

The program first initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively. It then iterates over the string `s` from right to left, updating the pointers and the product `p` accordingly. If the current character is 'R', it increments `r` and multiplies `p` by the element at index `r`. If the current character is 'L', it decrements `l` and multiplies `p` by the element at index `l`. The product `p` is taken modulo `m` at each step.

The program then appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans` after each iteration. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the order in which the commands were processed.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array `a` is empty or the string `s` is empty. It also correctly handles the case where the product `p` overflows, by taking the product modulo `m` at each step.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
