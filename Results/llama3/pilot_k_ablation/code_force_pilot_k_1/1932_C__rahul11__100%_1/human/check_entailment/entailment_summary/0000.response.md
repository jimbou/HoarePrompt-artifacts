Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the length of the array `n`, the value to take the remainder by `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.

2. The program initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `arr` respectively.

3. The program iterates over the string `s` from left to right and updates the pointers `l` and `r` based on the characters in `s`. If the character is 'L', it increments `l`, and if the character is 'R', it decrements `r`.

4. The program then iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. For each character, it calculates the product of the elements in `arr` at the current indices `l` and `r` modulo `m`, and appends the result to the list `ans`.

5. Finally, the program prints the results in the list `ans` in reverse order.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it handles all possible inputs correctly.

Correctness: **True**
