Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the modulus value `m`, the array elements `arr`, and the string of commands `s`.

3. It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. These pointers are used to track the current position in the array as commands are processed.

4. The program then iterates over the string of commands `s` in reverse order. For each command, it updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the element at the current position in the array (either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]`) and taking the modulus `m`.

5. The product `p` is appended to the list `ans` after each command.

6. Finally, the program prints the elements of `ans` in reverse order, which represents the remainders of the product of the array elements at each step.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of pointers `l` and `r` to track the current position in the array, and the calculation of the product `p` in reverse order, are key to the program's correctness.

Correctness: **True**
