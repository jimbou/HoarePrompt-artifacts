Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program first reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n`, the modulus `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.

2. It then initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.

3. The program then iterates over the string `s` from right to left. For each character in `s`, it updates the pointers `l` and `r` based on whether the character is 'L' or 'R'. This effectively simulates the removal of elements from the array as described in the problem statement.

4. The program then initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array modulo `m`.

5. The program then iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. For each character in `s`, it updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the element at the current position of the pointer `l` or `r`, depending on whether the character is 'L' or 'R'. The product is taken modulo `m` to prevent overflow.

6. The program appends the updated product `p` to a list `ans` after each iteration.

7. Finally, the program prints the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, which represents the product of the remaining elements in the array modulo `m` after each command in the string `s`.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
