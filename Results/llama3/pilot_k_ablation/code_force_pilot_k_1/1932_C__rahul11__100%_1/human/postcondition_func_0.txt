This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers, and a string of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. The function then calculates the product of certain elements in the list, modulo m, based on the string and prints the results in reverse order. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point stdin is empty.
