The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and m), a list of n integers (arr), and a string (s) of length n. It then calculates the product of elements in arr at specific indices (determined by the characters in s) modulo m, and prints the results in reverse order. The function consumes all input from stdin and produces output for each test case.
