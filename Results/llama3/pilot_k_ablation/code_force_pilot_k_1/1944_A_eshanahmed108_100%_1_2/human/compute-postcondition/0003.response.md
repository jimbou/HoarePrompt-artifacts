Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains a positive integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^3-1) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), and the value of `n` if `n - k` is greater than 1, otherwise 1 is being printed**
