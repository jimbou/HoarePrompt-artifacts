The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is greater than 1; otherwise, it prints 1. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`.

Output: **n if n - k > 1; otherwise, 1 (where n is an integer between 1 and 100, and k is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2)**
