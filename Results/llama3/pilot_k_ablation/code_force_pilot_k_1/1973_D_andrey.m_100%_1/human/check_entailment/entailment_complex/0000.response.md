Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} satisfying certain conditions. It first finds the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n. Then, it tries to find a value m that makes p equal to n after k iterations of func_1(p + 1, m). If such an m is found, it calls func_2(m). If no such m is found, it calls func_2(-1). The program also correctly handles the case where k is 1.

Correctness: **True**
