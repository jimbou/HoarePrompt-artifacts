Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} satisfying certain conditions. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest possible value of m.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and then executes the func_3() function t times. The func_3() function reads the length of the hidden array n and the number of subarrays k, and then attempts to find the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n. If such an i exists, it then tries to find a value m that makes p equal to n after k iterations of func_1(p + 1, m). If such an m is found, it calls func_2(m). If no such m is found, it calls func_2(-1).

The func_1() function queries the user with a message in the format '? [l] [x]' where 'l' and 'x' are positive integers, waits for an integer response, and returns the received integer value. The func_2() function prints the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} satisfying certain conditions, or -1 if no such m exists, and then reads an integer from standard input and returns it.

The program uses a correct approach to solve the problem, and the functions are correctly implemented. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
