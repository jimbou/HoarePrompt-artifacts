Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the maximum value in the array is not unique. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct maximum value and will not be able to split the array into the desired number of subarrays.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and k = 3, the program will not be able to find the correct maximum value and will not be able to split the array into 3 subarrays.

The program assumes that the maximum value in the array is unique and uses this assumption to find the maximum value and split the array. However, this assumption is not always true and the program does not handle the case where the maximum value is not unique.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
