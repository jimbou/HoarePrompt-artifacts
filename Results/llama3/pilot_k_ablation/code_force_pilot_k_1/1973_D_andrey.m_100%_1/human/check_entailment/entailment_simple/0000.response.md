Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that an array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with the product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest possible `m`.

The program first calls `func_3()` which reads the input `n` and `k` and then calls `func_1()` to find the maximum value `max_val` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. This is done to find the maximum possible value of `m`.

Then, the program iterates over possible values of `i` from `n // k` to 1 and calculates `m` as `i * max_val`. For each `m`, it calls `func_1()` `k` times to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the product of their length and maximum equal to `m`. If it can, it calls `func_2(m)` to print the answer and returns.

If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` to print -1 as the answer.

The program uses `func_1()` to make queries to the hidden array and `func_2()` to print the answer. The `func_4()` function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_3()` `t` times.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search approach to find the largest possible `m` and uses the `func_1()` and `func_2()` functions to make queries and print the answer, respectively.

Correctness: **True**
