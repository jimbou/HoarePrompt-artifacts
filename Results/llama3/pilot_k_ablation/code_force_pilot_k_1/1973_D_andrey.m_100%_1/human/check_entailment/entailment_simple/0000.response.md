Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} satisfying certain conditions. 

The program first finds the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n. This is done by iterating from n to 1 and checking the return value of func_1(1, i * n). If the return value is less than or equal to n, it sets max_val to i and breaks the loop.

Then, it iterates from n // k to 1 and checks if the current value i multiplied by max_val is a possible value for m. It does this by calling func_1(p + 1, m) k times and checking if the final value of p is equal to n. If it is, it calls func_2(m) and returns.

If no value of m is found, it calls func_2(-1).

The program correctly handles the case where no value of m exists and correctly outputs the largest value of m if it exists.

Correctness: **True**
