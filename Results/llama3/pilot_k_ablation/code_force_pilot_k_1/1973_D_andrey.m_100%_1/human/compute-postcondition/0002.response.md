Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0 and we have called the function func_3()**

The code calls the function `func_3()`, but since the definition of this function is not provided, we cannot determine its impact on the program state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the function `func_3()` has been called.
