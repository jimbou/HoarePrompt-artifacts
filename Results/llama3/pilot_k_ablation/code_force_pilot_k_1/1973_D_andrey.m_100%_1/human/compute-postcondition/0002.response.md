Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, and the function `func_3()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only calls the function `func_3()` without modifying these variables. The function `func_3()` is executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified, so we can only acknowledge that it has been executed.
