To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop iterates from `n // k` down to `1` (since the step is `-1`).
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n // k` must be greater than or equal to `1`.
3. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers, `n // k` will be an integer (because `//` is integer division in Python).
4. To guarantee that the loop executes, we need `n // k` to be at least `1`. This implies that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:


State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`**
