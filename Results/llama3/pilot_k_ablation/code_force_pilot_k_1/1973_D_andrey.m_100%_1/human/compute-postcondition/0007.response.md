To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `n // k` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and `n // k` is greater than 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`**
