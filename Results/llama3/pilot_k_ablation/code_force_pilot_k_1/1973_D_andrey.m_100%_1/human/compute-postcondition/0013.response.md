Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `n // k` is greater than 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, and `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `n // k`, `max_val`, `i`, `r`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is updated to be the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If the new value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, it is set to 0.
