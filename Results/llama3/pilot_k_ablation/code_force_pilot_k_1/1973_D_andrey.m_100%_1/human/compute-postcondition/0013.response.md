Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is updated to be the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`, unless `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, in which case it is set to 0.
