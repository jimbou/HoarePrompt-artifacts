Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `n // k` is greater than 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, and if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
