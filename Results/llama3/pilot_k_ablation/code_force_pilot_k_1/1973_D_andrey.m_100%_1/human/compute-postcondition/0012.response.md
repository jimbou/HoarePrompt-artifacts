Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
