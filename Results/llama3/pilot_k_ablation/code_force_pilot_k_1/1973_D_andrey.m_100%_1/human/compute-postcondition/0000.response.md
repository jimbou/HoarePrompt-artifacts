The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t` after converting it to an integer. The stdin contains a positive integer representing the number of test cases. So, `t` is assigned the value of this positive integer. The value of `t` is now a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin is now empty since it has been read. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**
