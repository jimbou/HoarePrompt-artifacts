The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains a positive integer `t` first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains no input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3**
