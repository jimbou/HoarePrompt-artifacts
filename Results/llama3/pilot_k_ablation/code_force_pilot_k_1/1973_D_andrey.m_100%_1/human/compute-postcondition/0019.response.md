Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, and either `func_2(m)` has been called with `m` being the largest `i * max_val` such that `p` equals `n` after the inner loop, or `func_2` has not been called if no such `m` exists.**
