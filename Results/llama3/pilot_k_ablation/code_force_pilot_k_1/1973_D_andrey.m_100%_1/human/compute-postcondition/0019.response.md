Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 0, `m` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` is either 0 if `p` was greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the loop, or the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after `k` iterations, and `p` is not equal to `n`. If `func_2(m)` was called, `m` is the value that made `p` equal to `n`**
