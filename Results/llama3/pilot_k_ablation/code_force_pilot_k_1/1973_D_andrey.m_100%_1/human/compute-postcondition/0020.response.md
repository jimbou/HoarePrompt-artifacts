Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, and `func_2(-1)` has been called.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. However, the code `func_2(-1)` has been executed, indicating that `func_2` has been called with the argument `-1`, regardless of whether `func_2` was previously called with a different argument or not.
