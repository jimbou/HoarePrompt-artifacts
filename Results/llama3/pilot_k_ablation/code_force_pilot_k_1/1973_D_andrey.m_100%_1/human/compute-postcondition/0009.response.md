According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the loop execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0. So, `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `n // k` is greater than 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1**
