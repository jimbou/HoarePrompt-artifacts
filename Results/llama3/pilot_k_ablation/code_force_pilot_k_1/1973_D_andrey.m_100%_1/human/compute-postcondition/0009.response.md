The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, max_val is the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, or 0 if no such i exists, i is n // k, m is (n // k) * max_val, p is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and j is now 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1**
