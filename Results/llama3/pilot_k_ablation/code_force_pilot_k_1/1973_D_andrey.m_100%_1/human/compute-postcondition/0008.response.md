Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n // k is greater than 0, max_val is either 0 or the largest i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, i is n // k, r is the return value of func_1(1, 1 * n), m is i * max_val, p is 0**

The code assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`, where `i` is `n // k` and `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. The value of `p` is set to 0. No other variables are affected.
