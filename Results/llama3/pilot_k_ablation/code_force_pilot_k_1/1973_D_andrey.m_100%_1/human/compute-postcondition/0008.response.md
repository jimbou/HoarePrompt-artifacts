Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, max_val is the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, or 0 if no such i exists, i is n // k, m is (n // k) * max_val, p is 0**

The code assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`, which is equivalent to `(n // k) * max_val` since `i` is `n // k`. The second line assigns the value `0` to `p`. No other variables are affected.
