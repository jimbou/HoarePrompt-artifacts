Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 0, n // k is greater than 0, max_val is either 0 or the largest i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, i is n // k, r is the return value of func_1(1, 1 * n), m is i * max_val, j is 1, and p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`, overwriting its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, the only change in the output state compared to the initial state is that the value of `p` is now 0. All other variables retain their initial values and properties as described in the precondition.
