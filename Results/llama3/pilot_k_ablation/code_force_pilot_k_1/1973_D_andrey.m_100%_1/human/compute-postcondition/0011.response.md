Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, max_val is the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, or 0 if no such i exists, i is n // k, m is (n // k) * max_val, p is 0, j is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`, overwriting its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `p` is now 0, while all other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, and `j`) retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
