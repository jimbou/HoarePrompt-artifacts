Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n // k` is greater than 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, and `p` is 0, and the return value of `func_2(m)` has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `r`, `m`, and `j` remain the same as before. However, the value of `p` is reset to 0 because it was previously equal to `n`. Additionally, the function `func_2(m)` has been executed and its return value has been returned.
