Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is `k`, and the current value of `p` is equal to `n`. The function `func_2` has been executed with the argument `m`, which is `(n // k) * max_val`.**

Note: The output state does not change the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `p` because the code snippet only executes the function `func_2` with the argument `m`, without assigning any new values to these variables. The function `func_2` may have side effects or return a value, but this is not specified in the initial state or the code snippet.
