This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the length of a hidden array and `k` is the number of subarrays in the desired split. It attempts to find the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. If such an `i` exists, it then tries to find a value `m` that makes `p` equal to `n` after `k` iterations of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If such an `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)`. If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`. The function does not return any value.
