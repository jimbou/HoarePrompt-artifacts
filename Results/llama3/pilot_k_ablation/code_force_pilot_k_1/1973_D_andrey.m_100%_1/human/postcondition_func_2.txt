This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and attempts to find the largest value `m` such that a certain condition is met. It iterates through possible values of `m` in descending order, checking if a specific inner loop results in a value `p` equal to `n`. If such an `m` is found, the function calls `func_2(m)` and returns. If no such `m` is found, the function calls `func_2(-1)`. The function does not return any value, but instead relies on the side effects of calling `func_2` with either a valid `m` or -1.
