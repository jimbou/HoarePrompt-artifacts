Output State: **stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the integers from index x+1 to i+x-1 (if i+x-1 is less than n) or the sum of the integers in a plus a[i-1] (if i+x-1 is not less than n), and the maximum value in the list ans has been printed for each test case.**
