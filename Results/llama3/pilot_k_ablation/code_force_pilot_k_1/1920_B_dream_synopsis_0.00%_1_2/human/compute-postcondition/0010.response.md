Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of sums, stdin contains 0 test cases, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then sums is the updated value of sums + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, sums is the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.***
