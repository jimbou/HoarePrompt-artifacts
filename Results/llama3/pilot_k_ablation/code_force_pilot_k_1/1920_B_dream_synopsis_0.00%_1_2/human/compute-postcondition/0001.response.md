Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, stdin contains 0 test cases**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n`, `k`, and `x`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The fourth line reverses the sorted list `a`, making it in descending order. The fifth line calculates the sum of the integers in `a` and assigns it to `sum1`. The sixth line initializes an empty list `ans`. After the execution of the code, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, and `ans` is an empty list. Stdin is empty as all test cases have been consumed.
