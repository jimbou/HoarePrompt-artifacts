Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers in descending order, calculates a series of sums by subtracting twice the sum of certain subsets of integers from the total sum, and prints the maximum of these sums for each test case. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
