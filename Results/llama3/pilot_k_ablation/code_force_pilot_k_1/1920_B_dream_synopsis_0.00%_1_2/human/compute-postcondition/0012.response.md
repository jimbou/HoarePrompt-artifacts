Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list of `k+1` integers where each integer is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers from index `x+1` to `i+x-1` (if `i+x-1` is less than `n`) or the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i-1]` (if `i+x-1` is not less than `n`), and `stdin` contains 0 test cases. If `k` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
