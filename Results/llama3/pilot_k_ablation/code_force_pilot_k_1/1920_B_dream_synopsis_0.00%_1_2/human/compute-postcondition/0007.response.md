Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is not equal to 0, and the current value of i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The list `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
