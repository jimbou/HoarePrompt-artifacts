Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is the sum of the integers in a plus a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated to include the integer at index `i - 1` in list `a`. The list `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
