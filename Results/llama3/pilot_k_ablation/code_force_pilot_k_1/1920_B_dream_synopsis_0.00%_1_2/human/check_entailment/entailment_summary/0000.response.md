Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`.
2.  It then reads the `n` integers and sorts them in descending order.
3.  The program calculates a series of sums by considering different scenarios where Alice removes `i` elements (from 0 to `k`) and Bob multiplies `x` elements by -1. The sums are calculated by subtracting twice the sum of certain subsets of integers from the total sum.
4.  The program prints the maximum of these sums for each test case, which represents the optimal outcome for Alice.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
