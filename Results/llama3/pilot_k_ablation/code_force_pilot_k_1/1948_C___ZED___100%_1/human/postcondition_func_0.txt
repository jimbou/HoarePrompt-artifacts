This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and two strings (a and b) of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks if the strings satisfy a specific condition: for every odd-indexed character in the strings, if the character at that index and the character at the next index in the other string are both '<', or if the character at that index and the character at the previous index in the other string are both '<', it prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If no such condition is found, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
