stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: the first input is an even integer (n) greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 200000; the second input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters; the third input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.
