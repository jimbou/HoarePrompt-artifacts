Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, if `n` is 0 or 1 then `i` is not defined, if `n` is greater than 1 then `i` is `n-1` if no pair of '<' characters were found in the strings `a` and `b` as specified in the loop, otherwise `i` is the index where the pair of '<' characters were found.**
