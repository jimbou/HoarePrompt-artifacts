Output State: **`j` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 that must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `j`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is still true. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
