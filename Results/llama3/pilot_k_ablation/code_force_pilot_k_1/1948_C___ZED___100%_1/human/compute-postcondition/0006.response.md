Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` plus 1 is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `i` plus 1 is less than `n` still holds, and the condition that either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<' is still true. Additionally, 'NO' is printed.
