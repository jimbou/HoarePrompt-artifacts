The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and the input is at least 1.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, `j` is 0, the input is at least 1**
