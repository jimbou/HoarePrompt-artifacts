Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 1. If `i` plus 1 is less than `n` and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
