Postcondition: ***j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 that must be greater than or equal to 3, a is a string, b is a string, i is 1. If i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
