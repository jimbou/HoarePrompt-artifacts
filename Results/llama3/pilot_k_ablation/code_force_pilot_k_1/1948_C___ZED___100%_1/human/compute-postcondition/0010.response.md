Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two strings of '<' and '>' characters. It checks for each test case whether there exists a pair of adjacent characters in the two strings that are both '<'. If such a pair exists, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
