Output State: **j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a string, b is a string**

In this output state, the variable `j` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin, which initially contained an integer `t` followed by `t` test cases, now contains `t-1` test cases because the first line of the code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. The variable `n` now holds an integer value between 1 and 10^4, as specified in the initial state. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned string values from the next two lines of input, respectively.
