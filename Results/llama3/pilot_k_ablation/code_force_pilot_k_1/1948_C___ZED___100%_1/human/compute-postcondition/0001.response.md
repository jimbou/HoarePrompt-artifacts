Output State: **j is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs.**

In this final state, the value of `j` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the first input in stdin. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned string values from the second and third inputs in stdin, respectively. After these assignments, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that were consumed by the code.
