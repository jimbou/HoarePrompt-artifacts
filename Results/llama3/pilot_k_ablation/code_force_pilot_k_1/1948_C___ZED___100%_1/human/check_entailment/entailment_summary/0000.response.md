Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description.

The program iterates over each test case, reading the number of columns (n) and the two strings representing the grid. It then checks for each pair of adjacent characters in the two strings (starting from the second column, i.e., index 1) whether both characters are '<'. If such a pair is found, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it prints 'YES'.

The logic is correct because if there is a pair of adjacent characters that are both '<', it means that the robot cannot move to the right in that column, and therefore cannot reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if no such pair is found, it means that the robot can always move to the right, and therefore can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
