Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks the condition specified in the problem description. If the condition is met, it prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If the condition is not met for any odd-indexed character, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description, such as n being even and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases from standard input and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.

Correctness: **True**
