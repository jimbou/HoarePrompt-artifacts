Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over each test case, reading the number of columns (n) and the two rows of the grid (a and b). It then checks for each pair of adjacent columns (i and i+1) whether there are two '<' arrows pointing to the left, either in the same row (a[i] == '<' and b[i+1] == '<') or in different rows (a[i] == '<' and b[i-1] == '<'). If such a pair is found, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found after checking all columns, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem statement, including the fact that n is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.

Correctness: **True**
