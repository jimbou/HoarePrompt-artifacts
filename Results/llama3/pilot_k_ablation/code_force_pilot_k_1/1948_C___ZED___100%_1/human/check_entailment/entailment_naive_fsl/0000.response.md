Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for certain patterns in the arrows, but it does not actually simulate the movement of the robot.

A counterexample is when the input is:

4
>><<
><>>

The program will output "YES", but the robot cannot actually reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the movement of the robot and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by trying all possible moves.
