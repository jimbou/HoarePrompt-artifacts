Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print 'YES', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (1, 3).

The issue with the program is that it only checks for certain patterns in the arrows, but it does not consider all possible paths that the robot can take. It does not simulate the movement of the robot and check if it can reach the target cell. Therefore, it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
