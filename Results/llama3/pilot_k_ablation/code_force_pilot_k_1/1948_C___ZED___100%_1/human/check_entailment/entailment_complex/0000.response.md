Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given conditions.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the input strings `a` and `b`, and checks the condition for every odd-indexed character. If the condition is met, it prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If no such condition is found, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is even, and there are no arrows pointing outside the grid. It also correctly processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
