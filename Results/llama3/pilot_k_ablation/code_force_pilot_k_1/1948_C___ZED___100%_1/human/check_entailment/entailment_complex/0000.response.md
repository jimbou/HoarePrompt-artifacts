Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over each pair of adjacent characters in the two strings (a and b) and checks if both characters are '<'. If it finds such a pair, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all pairs, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The program's logic is correct because if there is a pair of adjacent characters that are both '<', it means that the robot will be stuck in an infinite loop and cannot reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if there is no such pair, it means that the robot can always move forward and eventually reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
