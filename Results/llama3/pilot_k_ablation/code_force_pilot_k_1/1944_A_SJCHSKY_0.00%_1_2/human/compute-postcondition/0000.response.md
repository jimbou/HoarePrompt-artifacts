Output State: **`qs` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains `qs` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 0 <= `k` <= `n` * (`n` - 1) / 2).**

In this output state, the value of `qs` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `qs` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is between 0 and `n` * (`n` - 1) / 2 (inclusive).
