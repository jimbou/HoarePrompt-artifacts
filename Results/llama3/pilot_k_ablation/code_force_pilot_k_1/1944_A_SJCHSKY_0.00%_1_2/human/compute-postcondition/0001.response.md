To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `qs`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `qs`. If `qs` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `qs` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `_` to reflect its initial value before the loop starts.

State: **`qs` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains `qs` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 0 <= `k` <= `n` * (`n` - 1) / 2), `_` is 0**
