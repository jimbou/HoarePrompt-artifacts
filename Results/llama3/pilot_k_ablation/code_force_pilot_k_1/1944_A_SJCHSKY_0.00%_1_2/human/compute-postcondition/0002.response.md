Output State: **qs is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains qs - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 0 and n * (n - 1) / 2 (inclusive), reachable_count is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**

The code first reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers n and k. The value of qs is reduced by 1 since one line has been read. The values of n and k are assigned to the variables n and k, respectively. The variable reachable_count is assigned the value of n. The variable _ remains unchanged at 0. The remaining lines in stdin are still present, but the number of lines is reduced by 1.
