The code prints the value of `reachable_count` which is 1.
Output: **qs is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains qs - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is the remainder of the initial value of k divided by the initial value of reachable_count minus 1 plus 1, reachable_count is 1, and this is printed: 1**
