Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True, stdin is empty**

The code executes as follows:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This leaves stdin with one less input.
*   The second line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin, converts them to a list of integers, and assigns it to `a`. This empties stdin.
*   The third line calculates the sum of all integers in `a` and assigns it to `total_water`.
*   The fourth line calculates the integer division of `total_water` by `n` and assigns it to `target`.
*   The fifth line initializes `current_balance` to 0.
*   The sixth line initializes `possible` to True.

After the code executes, `t` and `_` remain unchanged, `n` becomes an integer, `a` becomes a list of integers, `total_water` becomes the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` becomes the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is 0, and `possible` is True. Stdin is now empty.
