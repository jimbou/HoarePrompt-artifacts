Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the difference between the first element of `a` and `target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.***
