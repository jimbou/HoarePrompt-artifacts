Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element of `a` and `target`, and `possible` is False, indicating that `current_balance` was less than 0 at some point during the loop.***
