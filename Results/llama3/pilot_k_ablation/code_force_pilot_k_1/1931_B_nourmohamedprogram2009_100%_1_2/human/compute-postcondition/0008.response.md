Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element of `a` and `target`, `possible` is True if `current_balance` is never less than 0 during the loop, False otherwise.**
