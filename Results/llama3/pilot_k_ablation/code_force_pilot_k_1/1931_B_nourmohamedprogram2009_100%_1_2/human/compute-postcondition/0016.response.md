Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element of `a` and `target`, `possible` is a boolean indicating whether `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. The output will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, depending on the value of `possible`.**
