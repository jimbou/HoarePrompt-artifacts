The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, `_` must be 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0**
