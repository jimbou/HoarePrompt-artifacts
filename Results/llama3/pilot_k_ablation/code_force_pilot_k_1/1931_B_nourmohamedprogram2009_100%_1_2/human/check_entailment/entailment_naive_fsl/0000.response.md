Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight is that the program checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the pouring is only allowed from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

The program calculates the target amount of water each container should have by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers. It then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the current balance of water. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to pour into the current container to reach the target amount, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

If the program finishes iterating through all the containers without setting `possible` to `False`, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount. Therefore, the program is correct.
