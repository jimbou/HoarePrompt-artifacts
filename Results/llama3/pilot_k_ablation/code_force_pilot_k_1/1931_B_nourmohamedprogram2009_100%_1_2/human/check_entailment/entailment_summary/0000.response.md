Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program calculates the target amount of water in each container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers. It then iterates over the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

If the program finishes iterating over all containers without finding a negative cumulative difference, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
