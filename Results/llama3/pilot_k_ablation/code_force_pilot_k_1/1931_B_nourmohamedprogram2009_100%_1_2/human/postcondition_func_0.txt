This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It determines whether it's possible to redistribute the integers such that each integer is equal to the average of the list, by checking if the cumulative sum of differences between each integer and the average ever becomes negative. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if redistribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise.
