The value of `a[n - 1]` is updated to `n // 2 + 1`. The value of `n` is an integer at least 1, and the list `a` has a length of `n`, which is odd. The initial values of `a` are such that `a[2 * i] = i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i` for `i` in range(`n // 2`). Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` is an integer. Therefore, the value of `a[n - 1]` is updated to `n // 2 + 1`, which is an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[2 * i] = i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i` for `i` in range(`n // 2`), and `a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1`.**
