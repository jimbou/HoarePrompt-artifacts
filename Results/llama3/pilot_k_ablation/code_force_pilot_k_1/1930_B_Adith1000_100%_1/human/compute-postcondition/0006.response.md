Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers where the first half of the elements are in ascending order from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive) and the second half of the elements are in descending order from `n` to `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive), except for the middle element which is `n // 2 + 1`. The length of `a` is an odd number.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` still has an odd length, but the middle element at index `n - 1` has been updated to `n // 2 + 1`. The first half of the elements in `a` are still in ascending order from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive), and the second half of the elements are still in descending order from `n` to `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive), except for the middle element which has been explicitly set to `n // 2 + 1`.
