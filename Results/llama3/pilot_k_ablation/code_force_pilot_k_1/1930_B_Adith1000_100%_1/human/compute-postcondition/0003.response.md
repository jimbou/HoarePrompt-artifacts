Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 0, a is a list of integers from 1 to n with a[1] = n - i and a[0] = i + 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is modified by the code. The value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is set to `n - i`, and the value of `a[2 * i]` is set to `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `a[1]` is set to `n - 0` which is `n`, and `a[0]` is set to `0 + 1` which is 1. The state of stdin remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
