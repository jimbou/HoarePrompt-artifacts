Based on the initial state, the list `a` is composed of two halves: the first half contains positive integers in ascending order from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive), and the second half contains positive integers in descending order from `n` to `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive). If the length of `a` is an odd number, the middle element is `n // 2 + 1`.

The `print(*a)` statement will print all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n // 2, (n // 2 + 1), n, n - 1, ..., n // 2 + 1 (where n is the given positive integer)**
