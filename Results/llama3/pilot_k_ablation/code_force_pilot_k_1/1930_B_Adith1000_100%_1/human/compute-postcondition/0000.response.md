To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1. Since `input()` reads from `stdin`, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure it contains at least one test case.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one test case, `_` is undefined, `int(input())` is at least 1**
