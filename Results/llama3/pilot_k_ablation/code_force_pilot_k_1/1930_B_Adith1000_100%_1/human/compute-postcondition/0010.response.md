Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers where the first half of the elements are in ascending order from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive) and the second half of the elements are in descending order from `n` to `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive). If the length of `a` is an odd number, the middle element is `n // 2 + 1`. The list `a` has been printed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.**
