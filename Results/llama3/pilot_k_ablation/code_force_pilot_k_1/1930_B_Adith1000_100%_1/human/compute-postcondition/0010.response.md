Output State: **stdin is empty, t is an integer between 1 and 10^3, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5, a is a list of integers where a[2 * i] = i + 1 and a[2 * i + 1] = n - i for i in range(n // 2). If the length of a is odd, a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1. The elements of the list a have been printed t times.**
