To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we need to ensure that `n // 2` is at least 1, so the loop can execute. This means `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of positive integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one input (the first input has been consumed)**
