According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0,  `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**
