This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 't' followed by 't' integers 'n'. For each 'n', it generates a list 'a' of length 'n' and rearranges its elements such that the first half are in ascending order from 1 to 'n // 2' and the second half are in descending order from 'n' to 'n // 2 + 1'. If 'n' is odd, the middle element is set to 'n // 2 + 1'. The rearranged list 'a' is then printed for each test case.
