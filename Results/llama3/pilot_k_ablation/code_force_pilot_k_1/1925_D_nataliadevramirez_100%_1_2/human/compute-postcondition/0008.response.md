The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the result of the expression `(num * den) % MOD`. Here, `num` is calculated as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, and `den` is calculated as `pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD)`. The value of `ans` is the product of `num` and `den` modulo `MOD`.

Output: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is the sum of the third integers from p inputs, p is an integer, i is p-1 if p is greater than 0, otherwise i is 0, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is (num * den) % MOD, stdin contains p less inputs, and ans is printed**
