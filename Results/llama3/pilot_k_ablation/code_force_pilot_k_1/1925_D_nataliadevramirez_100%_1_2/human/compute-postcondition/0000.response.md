Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line than before.**

The first line assigns the value of the first line of the input to T, which is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4. The second line assigns the value 1000000007 to MOD. No other variables are affected. Since T is assigned a value from stdin, stdin now contains one less line than before.
