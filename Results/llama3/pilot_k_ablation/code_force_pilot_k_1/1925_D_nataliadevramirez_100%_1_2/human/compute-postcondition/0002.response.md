The code block consists of three lines. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to the variables `n`, `p`, and `k`, respectively. The second line initializes a variable `S` to 0. The third line does not affect any variables.

After the execution of the code block, the values of `n`, `p`, and `k` are updated to the values read from stdin. The value of `S` is set to 0. The values of `T`, `MOD`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, _ is 0, n is an integer, p is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line than before**
