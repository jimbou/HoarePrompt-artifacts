To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `p`. The loop will execute if `p` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know that `T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `S` is 0. However, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is 0, `p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
