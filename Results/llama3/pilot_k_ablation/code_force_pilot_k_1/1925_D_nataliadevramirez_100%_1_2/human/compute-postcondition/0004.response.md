Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer from the input, `p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains one less input.**

In this output state, the value of `S` is increased by the third integer from the input, which is obtained by splitting the input string into a list of substrings separated by spaces and taking the third element of the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less input, as one input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
