Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer t, followed by 3 integers n, m, and k, and then m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.

The program calculates a result for each test case based on the input values and prints the result T times, where T is the number of test cases. The result is calculated using the formula (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) / (2 * C * C) modulo 1000000007, where C is the number of possible pairs of nodes (n * (n - 1) // 2), S is the sum of f_i values, and p is the number of edges.

The program reduces the fraction to its simplest form by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor before taking the modulo. This is done to avoid overflow and ensure accurate results.

The program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator, and the pow function with a negative exponent to calculate the modular inverse of the denominator.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
