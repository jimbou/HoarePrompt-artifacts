Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of the initial friendship values, and then calculates the expected value using the formula provided in the problem description.

The program also correctly handles the modular arithmetic, using the `pow` function with a negative exponent to calculate the modular inverse of the denominator. This is necessary because the problem requires the answer to be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime integers, and the modular inverse is used to ensure that the result is an integer.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of pairs of friends is 0, in which case the expected value is 0.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
