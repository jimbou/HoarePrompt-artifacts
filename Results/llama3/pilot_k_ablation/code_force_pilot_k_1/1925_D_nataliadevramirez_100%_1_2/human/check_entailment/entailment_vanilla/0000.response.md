Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program takes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k) as input. It then calculates the sum of the initial friendship values (S) and the total number of possible pairs (C).

The program then calculates the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the expected value. The numerator is calculated as the sum of the products of the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and the sum of the initial friendship values. The denominator is calculated as the product of the total number of possible pairs and the number of excursions.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (g) of the numerator and denominator and divides both by g to simplify the fraction. It then calculates the modular inverse of the denominator (den) modulo 10^9+7 using the pow function.

Finally, the program calculates the expected value by multiplying the numerator by the modular inverse of the denominator and taking the result modulo 10^9+7.

Correctness: **True**
