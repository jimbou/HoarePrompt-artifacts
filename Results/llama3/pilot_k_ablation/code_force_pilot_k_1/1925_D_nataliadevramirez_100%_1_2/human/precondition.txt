t is a positive integer, for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), and 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, for each of the m pairs, a_i, b_i, and f_i are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, all pairs of friends are distinct.
