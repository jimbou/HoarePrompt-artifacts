The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer t, followed by 3 integers n, m, and k, and then m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates a result for each test case based on the input values and prints the result T times, where T is the number of test cases. The result is calculated using the formula (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) / (2 * C * C) modulo 1000000007, where C is the number of possible pairs of nodes (n * (n - 1) // 2), S is the sum of f_i values, and p is the number of edges. The function reduces the fraction to its simplest form by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor before taking the modulo.
