This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes each test case by sorting the integers, identifying pairs of equal elements, and printing two lists of pairs until k pairs are found or all pairs are exhausted. The function repeats this process for all test cases, emptying the standard input in the process.
