This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, sorting them into two lists and identifying pairs of consecutive equal elements. It constructs two output lists, ans1 and ans2, which contain two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements from the corresponding input lists, as well as up to k elements from the list of elements that do not have consecutive equal elements. The function prints these output lists and repeats this process for all test cases.
