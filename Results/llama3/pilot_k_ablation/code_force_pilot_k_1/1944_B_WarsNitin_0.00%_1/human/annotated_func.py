#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        b = a[:n]
        
        c = a[n:]
        
        b.sort()
        
        c.sort()
        
        ans1 = []
        
        ans2 = []
        
        k = 2 * k
        
        req = k
        
        l = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
                ans1.append(b[i])
                ans1.append(b[i])
                k -= 2
            elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
                l.append(b[i - 1])
        
        if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[n - 1])
        
        k = req

        for i in range(len(l)):

                break

    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, q is equal to the initial value of t, n is the last value of n from the last test case, a is the last list of 2n integers from the last test case, b is the last sorted list of n integers from the last test case, c is the last sorted list of n integers from the last test case, ans1 and ans2 are the last lists containing pairs of equal elements from b and c respectively until k became 0 from the last test case, l is the last list containing elements from b that are not in ans1 from the last test case, i is equal to the length of l if k is not 0 from the last test case, otherwise i is the index where k became 0 from the last test case, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to 0 from the last test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes each test case by sorting the integers, identifying pairs of equal elements, and printing two lists of pairs until k pairs are found or all pairs are exhausted. The function repeats this process for all test cases, emptying the standard input in the process.
