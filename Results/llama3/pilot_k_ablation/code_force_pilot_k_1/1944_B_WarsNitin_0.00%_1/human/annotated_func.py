#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        b = a[:n]
        
        c = a[n:]

            if b[i] == b[i - 1]:

    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, q is equal to the initial value of t, ans1 and ans2 are lists containing two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in the corresponding sublists of a and up to k elements from the list of elements that do not have consecutive equal elements, req is 2 times an integer, b and c are sorted lists of n integers, i is equal to the last value of n, l contains all elements from b that are not in ans1 and do not have a consecutive equal element and the last element of b is added to l, and k is 0 or less.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, sorting them into two lists and identifying pairs of consecutive equal elements. It constructs two output lists, ans1 and ans2, which contain two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements from the corresponding input lists, as well as up to k elements from the list of elements that do not have consecutive equal elements. The function prints these output lists and repeats this process for all test cases.
