Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by finding two arrays l and r each of length 2k such that l is a subset of [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}] and the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

The program first separates the input array a into two arrays b and c, each of length n. It then sorts these arrays. The program then iterates over the sorted arrays to find pairs of equal elements. If it finds a pair of equal elements in b, it adds these elements to ans1. If it finds a pair of equal elements in c, it adds these elements to ans2. If it doesn't find a pair of equal elements in b, it adds the single element to a list l. After iterating over the sorted arrays, it adds the elements from l to ans1 and ans2 until k becomes 0.

This solution is correct because it ensures that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r. The program also ensures that l is a subset of [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}]. The program also handles the case where k is not a multiple of 2 by adding the remaining elements from l to ans1 and ans2.

Correctness: **True**
