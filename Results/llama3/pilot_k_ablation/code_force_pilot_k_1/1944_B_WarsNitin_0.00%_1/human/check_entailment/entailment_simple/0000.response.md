Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by first sorting the two halves of the input array `a` and then constructing the two output arrays `ans1` and `ans2` by selecting pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves and filling the remaining elements from the list of elements that do not have consecutive equal elements.

The program correctly handles the case where `k` is less than the number of pairs of equal elements in the sorted halves, and it also correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than or equal to the number of pairs of equal elements in the sorted halves.

The program also correctly prints the two output arrays `ans1` and `ans2` in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
