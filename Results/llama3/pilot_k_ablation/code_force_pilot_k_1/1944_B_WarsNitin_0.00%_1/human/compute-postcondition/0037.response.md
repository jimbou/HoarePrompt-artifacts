Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, q is equal to the initial value of t, n is the last value of n from the last test case, a is the last list of 2n integers from the last test case, b is the last sorted list of n integers from the last test case, c is the last sorted list of n integers from the last test case, ans1 and ans2 are the last lists containing pairs of equal elements from b and c respectively until k became 0 from the last test case, l is the last list containing elements from b that are not in ans1 from the last test case, i is equal to the length of l if k is not 0 from the last test case, otherwise i is the index where k became 0 from the last test case, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to 0 from the last test case.**
