To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2 times an integer, `q` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times an integer, `l` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, `i` is 1**
