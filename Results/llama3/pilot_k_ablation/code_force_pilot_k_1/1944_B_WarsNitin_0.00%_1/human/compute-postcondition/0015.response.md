Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers `n` and `k`, and `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `2n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of equal elements from `b` until `k` is 0, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `i` is equal to `n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `i` is the index where `k` became 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`.***
