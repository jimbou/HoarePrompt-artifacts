Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from b until k is 0, ans2 is a list containing two pairs of equal elements from c, l is a list containing elements from b that are not in ans1, if b[n - 1] is not in ans1, it is added to l, i is 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to req - 2. If k is 0, the current value of k is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of c[i] is equal to the current value of c[i - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains greater than 0, and `q` remains 0. The input stream `stdin` still contains the remaining test cases. The lists `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original properties. The list `ans1` still contains pairs of equal elements from `b` until `k` is 0. The list `ans2` now contains two pairs of equal elements from `c`. The list `l` still contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, and if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, it is added to `l`. The value of `i` remains 1. The value of `k` is now equal to `req - 2`, and if `k` is 0, the current value of `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`.
