Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is at least 2, q is 0, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in b, ans2 is a list containing two copies of the current value of c[i], req is 2 times an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}, i is 1, l contains all elements from b that are not in ans1 and do not have a consecutive equal element and the last element of b is added to l, k is reduced by 2.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans2`, `k`, and does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `ans1`, `req`, `b`, `c`, `stdin`, `i`, and `l`. The value of `ans2` is updated to include two copies of the current value of `c[i]`, which is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`. The value of `k` is reduced by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
