Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2 times an integer, `q` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times an integer, `l` contains `b[i - 1]`, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `l` now contains the value of `b[i - 1]`, which is the second last element of the sorted list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
