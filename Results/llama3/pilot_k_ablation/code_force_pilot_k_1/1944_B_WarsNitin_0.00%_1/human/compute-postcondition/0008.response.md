Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer greater than or equal to 0, l is an empty list, i is 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to -2.**

The code appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two copies of the same value. Since `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the two appended values are the same. The value of `k` is then decremented by 2. The remaining variables and stdin are unaffected by the code.
