The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer read from stdin is the number of test cases, which is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n.**
