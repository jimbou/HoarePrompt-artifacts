The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line of the first test case is read and its integer value is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}.**
