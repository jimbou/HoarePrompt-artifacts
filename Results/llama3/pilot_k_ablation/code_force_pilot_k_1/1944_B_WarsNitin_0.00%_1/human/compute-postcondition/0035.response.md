The code prints the elements of the list `ans2`. The list `ans2` contains two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in the sorted list `c` and up to `k` elements from the list `l`. Since `k` is 0 or less, no elements from `l` are included in `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` only contains two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in `c`.

Output: **two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in the sorted list c**
