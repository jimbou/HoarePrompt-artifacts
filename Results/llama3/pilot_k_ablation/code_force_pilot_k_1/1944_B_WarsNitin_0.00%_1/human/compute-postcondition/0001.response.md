The only variables in the loop head are variables  q and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is the number of test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and q is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n.**
