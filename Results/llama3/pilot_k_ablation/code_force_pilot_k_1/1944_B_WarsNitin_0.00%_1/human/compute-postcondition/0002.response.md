Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, k is 2 times an integer, q is 0, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is 2 times an integer, l is an empty list, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `q` also remains unchanged as 0. The variables `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` are initialized as empty lists. The variable `k` is updated to be twice its original value. The variable `req` is assigned the value of `2 * k`. The variables `b` and `c` are assigned sorted lists of `n` integers each, where `n` is an integer. The stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`.
