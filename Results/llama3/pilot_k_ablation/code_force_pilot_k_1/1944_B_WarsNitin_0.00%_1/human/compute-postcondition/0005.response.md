Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `q` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times an integer, `l` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
