Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0 or 2 times an integer, `q` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times an integer, `l` contains all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and do not have a consecutive equal element and the last element of `b` is added to `l`, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, `i` is `n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `i` is the index where `k` became 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `b`, `c`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the last element of `b` is added to the list `l`.
