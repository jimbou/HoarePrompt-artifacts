To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Since `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, and `b[n - 1]` is added to `l` if it's not in `ans1`, we can infer that `l` must have at least one element if `b` has at least one element that is not in `ans1`.

State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from b until k is 0, ans2 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from c until k is 0, l is a list containing at least one element from b that is not in ans1, i is 0, k is 0**
