Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from b until k is 0, ans2 is a list containing two pairs of equal elements from c if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing elements from b that are not in ans1, if b[n - 1] is not in ans1, it is added to l, i is 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to req - 2 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to req. If k is 0, the current value of k is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
