Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `q` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each pair of consecutive equal elements in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` remains an empty list, `req` is 2 times an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, `i` is 1, `l` contains all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and do not have a consecutive equal element and the last element of `b` is added to `l`, and `k` is reduced by 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.***
