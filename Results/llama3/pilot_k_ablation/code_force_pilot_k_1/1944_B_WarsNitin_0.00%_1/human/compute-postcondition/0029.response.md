Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers `n` and `k`, and 2n integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_2n`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of equal elements from `b` until `k` is 0, `ans2` is a list containing pairs of equal elements from `c` until `k` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least one element from `b` that is not in `ans1`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, and the lists `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` maintain their respective properties. The variable `i` remains at 0, and `k` is still 0.
