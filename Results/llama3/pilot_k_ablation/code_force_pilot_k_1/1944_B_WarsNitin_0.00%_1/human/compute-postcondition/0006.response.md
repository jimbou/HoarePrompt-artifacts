Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers `n` and `k`, and `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `2n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the remaining test cases.***
