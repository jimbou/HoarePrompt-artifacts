Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from b until k is 0, ans2 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from c until k is 0, l is a list containing at least one element from b that is not in ans1, i is 0, and the current value of k is 0.**
