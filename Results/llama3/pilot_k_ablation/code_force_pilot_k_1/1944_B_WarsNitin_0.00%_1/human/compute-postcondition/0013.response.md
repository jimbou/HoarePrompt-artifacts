Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers `n` and `k`, and `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `2n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to -2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `ans2` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans1` is a list that does not contain `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the remaining test cases.***
