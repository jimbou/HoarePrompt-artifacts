Output: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: two integers n and k, and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from b until k is 0, ans2 is a list containing pairs of equal elements from c until k is 0, l is a list containing elements from b that are not in ans1, if b[n - 1] is not in ans1, it is added to l, i is equal to the length of l if k is not 0, otherwise i is the index where k became 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is now equal to 0, ans1 and ans2 contain all elements from l if k is not 0, otherwise they contain elements from l until k became 0, and this is printed: the list ans2 containing pairs of equal elements from c until k became 0**
