The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). After accepting this integer, the stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**
