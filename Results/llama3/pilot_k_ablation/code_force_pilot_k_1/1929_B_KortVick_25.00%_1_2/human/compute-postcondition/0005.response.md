Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), and the current value of `k` is even, with the half of `k` being odd. stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers, and this is printed: k // 2 + 1, where k // 2 + 1 is equal to (k + 2) / 2, and since k is even and k / 2 is odd, (k + 2) / 2 is equal to k / 2 + 1, which is equal to ((k / 2) + 1) which is equal to (k / 2) + 1**
