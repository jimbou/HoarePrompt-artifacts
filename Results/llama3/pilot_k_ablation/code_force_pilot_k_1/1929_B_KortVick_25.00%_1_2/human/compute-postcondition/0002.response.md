Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of input, which are within the specified ranges. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
