Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers. Either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, and the ceiling of half of `k` is being printed.**
