The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) ensures that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not initialized before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**
