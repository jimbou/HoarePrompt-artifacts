The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), and the current value of `k` is even, with the half of `k` being odd.

Since `k` is even, `k // 2` will be an integer. Adding 1 to this result will give an odd number.

Output: **an odd number between 2 and 2n (inclusive)**
