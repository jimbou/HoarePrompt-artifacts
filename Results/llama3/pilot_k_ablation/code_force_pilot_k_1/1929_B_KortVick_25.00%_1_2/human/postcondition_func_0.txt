The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then calculates and prints the ceiling of k/2 for each test case, with a special case for when k is even and k/2 is odd, in which case it prints k/2 + 1. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
