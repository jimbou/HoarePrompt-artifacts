stdin contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. n and m are positive integers, k is an even positive integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). a_i and b_j are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6.
