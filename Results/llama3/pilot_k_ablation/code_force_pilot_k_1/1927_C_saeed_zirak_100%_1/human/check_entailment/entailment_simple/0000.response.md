Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the input and stores the values of n, m, and k.
2. It then reads the elements of arrays a and b and stores them in frozensets.
3. It initializes variables leftOnes, aOnes, and bOnes to 0. These variables will be used to count the number of elements that are present in both arrays, only in array a, and only in array b, respectively.
4. It then iterates from 1 to k and checks if each number is present in both arrays, only in array a, or only in array b. It increments the corresponding counter variable accordingly.
5. After the iteration, it checks if the number of elements present in both arrays (leftOnes) is less than the number of elements that need to be chosen from each array (newk). If it is, it increments the counter variables aOnes and bOnes alternately until leftOnes is equal to newk.
6. Finally, it checks if the number of elements present only in array a (aOnes) and only in array b (bOnes) are both equal to newk. If they are, it prints "yes", indicating that it is possible to choose the required elements. Otherwise, it prints "no".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
