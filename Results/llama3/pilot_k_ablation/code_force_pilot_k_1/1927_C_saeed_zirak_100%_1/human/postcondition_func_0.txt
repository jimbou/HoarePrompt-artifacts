This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'yes' or 'no' to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function iterates over a specified number of test cases, each consisting of three integers and two sets of integers. It then checks if it's possible to make the two sets have the same number of elements by adding or removing elements from the sets, while maintaining a specific constraint. If it's possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program in a state where all variables are undefined and stdin contains no input.
