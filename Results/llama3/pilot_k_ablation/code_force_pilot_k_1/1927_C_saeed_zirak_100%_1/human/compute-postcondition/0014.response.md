Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0 and either `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is 1, or `i` is not in `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` is empty.***
