Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b` plus the minimum of `leftOnes` and the difference between `bOnes` and `aOnes`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a` plus the difference between `leftOnes` and the minimum of `leftOnes` and the difference between `bOnes` and `aOnes`, stdin is empty. The current value of `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and the current value of `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.***
