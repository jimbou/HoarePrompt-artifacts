Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no input. Additionally, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.***
