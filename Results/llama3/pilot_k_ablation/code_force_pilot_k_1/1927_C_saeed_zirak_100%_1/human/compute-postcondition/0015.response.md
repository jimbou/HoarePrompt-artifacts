Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no input, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, and `i` is 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0, and either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0 if `i` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b`, or the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `i` is in neither `a` nor `b`.**
