Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no input, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, and `i` is not in both `a` and `b`. The current value of `i` is in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, from 0 to 1, because the current value of `i` is in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
