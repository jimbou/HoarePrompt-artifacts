Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `i` is not in `a`. The current value of `i` is in `b`, stdin is empty.**

The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The conditions that `i` is not in `a` and the current value of `i` is in `b` are still valid.
