Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i + 5` is not equal to 'mapie', the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i + 3` is not equal to 'map', and the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i + 3` is not equal to 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the substrings of `s` are still valid, as the increment of `i` does not affect the values of these substrings.
