Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, ans is 1, i is 3, n is greater than 0, the substring of s from index i to i + 5 is not equal to 'mapie', and the substring of s from index i to i + 3 is not equal to 'map'. The current value of the substring of s from index i to i + 3 is not specified.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `i` has been incremented by 3, making it 3. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. The substring of `s` from index `i` to `i + 3` is no longer specified, as the value of `i` has changed.
