The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1 and then increments the value of `i` by 5. Since `ans` is initially 0, it becomes 1. The value of `i` is initially 0, so it becomes 5. The value of `s` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, ans is 1, i is 5, n is greater than 0**
