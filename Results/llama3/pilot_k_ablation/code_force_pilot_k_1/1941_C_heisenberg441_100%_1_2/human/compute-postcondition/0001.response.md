According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`. Since `i` is 0, it is already less than `n` if `n` is greater than 0. So, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
