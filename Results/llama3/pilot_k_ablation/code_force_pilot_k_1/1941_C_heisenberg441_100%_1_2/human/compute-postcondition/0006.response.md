Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, ans is 1, i is 3, n is greater than 0, the substring of s from index i to i + 5 is not equal to 'mapie', and the current value of the substring of s from index i to i + 3 is not 'map' but the substring of s from index i-3 to i is 'map'.**

The first line increments `ans` by 1, making `ans` equal to 1. The second line increments `i` by 3, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `s` remains unchanged, as does the value of `n`. The substring of `s` from index `i` to `i + 5` is still not equal to 'mapie', and the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i + 3` is no longer 'map', but the substring of `s` from index `i-3` to `i` is 'map'.
