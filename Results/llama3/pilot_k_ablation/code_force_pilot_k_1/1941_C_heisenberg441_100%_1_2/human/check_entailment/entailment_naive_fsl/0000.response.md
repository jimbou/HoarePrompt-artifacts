Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It checks for the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" and increments the count whenever it finds any of these substrings. The program also correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful by returning 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. It checks for the longest substring "mapie" first, and if it doesn't find it, it checks for the shorter substrings "map" and "pie". This ensures that it always finds the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program also correctly handles the case where the string contains multiple occurrences of the substrings. It uses a while loop to iterate over the string, and it increments the index `i` by the length of the substring whenever it finds a match. This ensures that it doesn't count the same substring multiple times.

Overall, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
