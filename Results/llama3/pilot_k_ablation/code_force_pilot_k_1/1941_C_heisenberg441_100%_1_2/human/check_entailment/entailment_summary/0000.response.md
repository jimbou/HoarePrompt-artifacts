Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program checks for non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in the string and increments the count accordingly. The program also handles the case where the string is already beautiful by returning 0.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program's output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
