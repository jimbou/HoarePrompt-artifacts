Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string `s` to make it beautiful, i.e., not containing the substrings "pie" or "map". The program uses a function `func_1` that iterates through the string `s` and counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie'. The function returns this count, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program's logic is correct because it checks for all possible substrings that make the string ugly and counts them correctly. The use of a while loop and the increment of the index `i` based on the length of the matched substring ensures that the function does not count overlapping occurrences.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement asks for the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted, but the program returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie'. These two values are not necessarily the same.

For example, consider the string "mapmap". The program would count two occurrences of 'map', but the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful is actually 3 (delete the first 'm', 'a', and 'p').

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
