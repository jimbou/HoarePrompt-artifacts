Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input, calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, and then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the amount of coins to bet on each outcome; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers. This function is used to simplify the fractions representing the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The execution summary shows that the `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of a list of numbers.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome and checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM.

Correctness: **True**
