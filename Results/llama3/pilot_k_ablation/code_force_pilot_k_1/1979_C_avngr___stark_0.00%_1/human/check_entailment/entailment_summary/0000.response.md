Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i`. This is done by multiplying all the `k_i` values together.
2.  Then, for each outcome `i`, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by `k_i`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
3.  The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the calculated coin amounts using the `func_1` function. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet while still satisfying the condition.
4.  Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the calculated coin amounts; otherwise, it prints -1.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the HCF of a list of numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the execution summary matches the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
