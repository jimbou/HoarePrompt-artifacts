Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input and calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program then checks if the sum of the amounts of coins to bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers. However, this function is not necessary for the correctness of the program, as the GCD is not used in the calculation of the amounts of coins to bet.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the use of the GCD function does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
