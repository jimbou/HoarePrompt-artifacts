Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bet amount for each outcome. The program then checks if the sum of the bet amounts is less than the LCM, and if so, prints the bet amounts. If the sum is not less than the LCM, the program prints -1.

The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bet amounts, which is used to reduce the bet amounts to their simplest form. This ensures that the bet amounts are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition that the sum of the bet amounts is less than the LCM.

The program handles all potential cases, including cases where the multipliers are large or have common factors. The program also handles cases where there is no solution, in which case it prints -1.

I have not found any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
