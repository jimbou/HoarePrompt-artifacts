Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the minimum amount of coins that must be bet on each outcome to ensure that the total amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes.

The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the LCM and each multiplier, and divides the LCM by the HCF to get the minimum amount of coins that must be bet on each outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized while still ensuring that the total amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the minimum amount of coins that must be bet on each outcome. If it is not, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
