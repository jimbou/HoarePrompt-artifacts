Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`) for each outcome.
3.  It calculates the least common multiple (`m`) of all the multipliers, which represents the total amount of coins that would be received back if any outcome wins.
4.  It then calculates the amount of coins to be bet on each outcome (`c`) by dividing the least common multiple (`m`) by the multiplier (`k`) for each outcome.
5.  To minimize the total amount of coins bet, it finds the highest common factor (`hcf`) of all the amounts (`c`) and divides each amount by this factor.
6.  Finally, it checks if the total amount of coins bet (`sum(c)`) is less than the total amount of coins received back (`m`). If it is, it prints the amounts to be bet on each outcome; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
