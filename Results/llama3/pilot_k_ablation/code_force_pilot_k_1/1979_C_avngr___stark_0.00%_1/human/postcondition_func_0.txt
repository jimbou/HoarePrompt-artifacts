This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all test cases in the input list `numbers`, where each test case is an integer and there are multiple test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The function takes a list of integers as input, where the first element represents the number of test cases, and the rest of the list consists of test cases. The function returns a single integer value, which is the gcd of all test cases.
