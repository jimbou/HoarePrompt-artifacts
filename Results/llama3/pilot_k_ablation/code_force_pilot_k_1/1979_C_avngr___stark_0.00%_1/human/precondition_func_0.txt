numbers is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list consists of test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) represents the number of outcomes, and the next n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) represent the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
