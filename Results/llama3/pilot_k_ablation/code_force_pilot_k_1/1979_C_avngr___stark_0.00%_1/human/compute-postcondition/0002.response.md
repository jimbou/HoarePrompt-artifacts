The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `hcf` and `num` and assigns it to `hcf`. The value of `hcf` is updated to be the gcd of its original value and `num`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list consists of test cases, `num` is the first test case, `hcf` is the gcd of the original value of `hcf` and `num`.**
