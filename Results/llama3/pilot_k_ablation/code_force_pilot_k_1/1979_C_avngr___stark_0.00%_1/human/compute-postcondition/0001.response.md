To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements.

At the start of the loop, `hcf` is equal to the first element of `numbers`. Since the loop will iterate over the remaining elements of `numbers`, we can infer that `num` will take the value of the second element of `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is an integer equal to the first element of `numbers`, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
