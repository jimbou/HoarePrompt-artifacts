#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers, `hcf` is an integer equal to the gcd of all elements of `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list 'numbers'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in a given list, leaving the original list unchanged.
