#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list consists of test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) represents the number of outcomes, and the next n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) represent the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list consists of test cases, `hcf` is the gcd of all test cases.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all test cases in the list `numbers`, where the test cases are integers and there are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) number of test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all test cases in the input list `numbers`, where each test case is an integer and there are multiple test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The function takes a list of integers as input, where the first element represents the number of test cases, and the rest of the list consists of test cases. The function returns a single integer value, which is the gcd of all test cases.
