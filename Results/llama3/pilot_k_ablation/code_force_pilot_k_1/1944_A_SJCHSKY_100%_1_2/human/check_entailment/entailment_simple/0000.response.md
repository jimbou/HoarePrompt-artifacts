Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program uses a simple function `func_1(n, k)` to determine this minimum number.

The function first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connecting island 1 to the other islands, effectively isolating island 1. In this case, the function correctly returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connecting island 1 to the other islands. In this case, Everule can still visit all islands, including island 1, because there will always be at least one path (possibly multiple bridges) connecting island 1 to each of the other islands. The function correctly returns `n` in this case, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
