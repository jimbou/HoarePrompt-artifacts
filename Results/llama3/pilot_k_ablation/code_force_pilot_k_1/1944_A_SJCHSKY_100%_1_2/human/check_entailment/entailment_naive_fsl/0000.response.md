Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The function `func_1(n, k)` checks if the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`k`) is greater than or equal to the number of islands minus one (`n - 1`). If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If the condition is false, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and therefore Everule can visit all islands. In this case, the function returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `k` is 0 (no bridges can be destroyed) and `k` is equal to the total number of bridges (`n * (n - 1) / 2`). The program also correctly handles cases where `n` is 1 (only one island) and `n` is greater than 1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
