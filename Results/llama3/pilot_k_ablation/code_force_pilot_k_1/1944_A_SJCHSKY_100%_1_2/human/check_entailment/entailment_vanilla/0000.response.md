Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program uses a function `func_1` to calculate this minimum number.

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy. The function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. In this case, Everule can still visit all islands, and the function returns `n`.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls the `func_1` function to calculate the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit. The result is then printed.

Based on the problem description and the provided program, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Correctness: **True**
