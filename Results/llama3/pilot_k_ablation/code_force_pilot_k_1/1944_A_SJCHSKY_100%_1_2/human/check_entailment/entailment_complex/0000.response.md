Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1(n, k)` correctly determines the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

The key insight is that if Dominater can destroy at least `n-1` bridges, then Everule can only visit island 1, because all bridges connecting island 1 to other islands can be destroyed. This is handled by the condition `if (k >= n - 1) : return 1`.

On the other hand, if Dominater can destroy fewer than `n-1` bridges, then Everule can still visit all islands, because there will always be at least one path connecting island 1 to each other island. This is handled by the condition `else : return n`.

The function correctly handles all possible cases, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
