#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.
    if (k >= n - 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return n
        #The program returns an integer n, where n is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and n is greater than k + 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph that must be connected to ensure that at least k edges exist. It takes two parameters, n and k, where n is the number of nodes and k is the number of edges. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, the function returns 1, indicating that all nodes must be connected. Otherwise, it returns the number of nodes n, which is greater than k+1, indicating that not all nodes need to be connected to achieve the desired number of edges.
