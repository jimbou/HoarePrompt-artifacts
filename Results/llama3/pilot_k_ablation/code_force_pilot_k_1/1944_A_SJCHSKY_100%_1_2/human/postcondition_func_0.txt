This function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph that must be connected to ensure that at least k edges exist. It takes two parameters, n and k, where n is the number of nodes and k is the number of edges. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, the function returns 1, indicating that all nodes must be connected. Otherwise, it returns the number of nodes n, which is greater than k+1, indicating that not all nodes need to be connected to achieve the desired number of edges.
