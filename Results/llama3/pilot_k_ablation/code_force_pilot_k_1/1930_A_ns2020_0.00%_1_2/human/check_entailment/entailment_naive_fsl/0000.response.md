Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program simply sums up every other element in the list, starting from the first one. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum final score.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

    1
    
    2
    
    1 3 2 1

The program will output 3 (1 + 2), but the optimal solution is to pair the numbers as (1, 1) and (2, 3), resulting in a maximum final score of 4 (1 + 2 + 1).

The correct approach would be to sort the list in ascending order and then pair the numbers from the start and end of the list, adding the smaller number of each pair to the score. This way, the program would ensure the maximum final score for all potential cases.
