Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads `2n` integers into a list `A`.
3. The program then calculates the sum of every other integer in the list `A`, starting from the first element, using the expression `sum(A[::2])`. This is equivalent to selecting the smaller of each pair of integers and adding it to the score.
4. The program prints the calculated sum for each test case.
5. The loop continues until all test cases have been processed.

The program's logic is correct because it implements the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score, which is to always select the smaller of each pair of integers and add it to the score. The use of slicing (`A[::2]`) to select every other integer is a clever and efficient way to implement this strategy.

Correctness: **True**
