Output State: **t is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 50), n is an integer, A is a list of integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is now an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `A`. Stdin now contains the remaining test cases. No other variables are affected.
