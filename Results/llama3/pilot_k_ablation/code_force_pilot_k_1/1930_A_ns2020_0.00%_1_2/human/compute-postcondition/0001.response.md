The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 50), which already ensures that `t` is not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 50), stdin contains the remaining test cases**
