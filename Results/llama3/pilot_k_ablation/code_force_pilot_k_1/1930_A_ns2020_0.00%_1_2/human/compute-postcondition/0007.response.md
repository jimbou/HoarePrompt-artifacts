Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of every other integer in the list, starting from the first element, for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.**
