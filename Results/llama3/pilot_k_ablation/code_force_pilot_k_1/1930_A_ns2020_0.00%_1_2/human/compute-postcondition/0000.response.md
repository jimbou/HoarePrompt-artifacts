The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n`, the value of `t` will be the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 50), stdin contains the remaining test cases**
