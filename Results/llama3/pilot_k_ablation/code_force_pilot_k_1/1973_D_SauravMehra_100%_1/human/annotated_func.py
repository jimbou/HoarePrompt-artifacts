#State of the program right berfore the function call: tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n.
    it = 0
    ind = 0
    while ind < n and it < k:
        print(f'? {ind + 1} {tar}')
        
        x = int(input())
        
        if x == n + 1:
            return False
        
        ind = x
        
        it += 1
        
    #State: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, `it` is equal to the minimum of `k` and `n`, `ind` is equal to the value of `x` in the last iteration of the loop, `x` is an integer such that `x != n + 1`, and stdin contains no input.
    return ind == n and it == k
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether `ind` is equal to `n` and `it` is equal to `k`, where `ind` is the value of `x` in the last iteration of the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `it` is the minimum of `k` and `n`, and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a target value (`tar`) up to `k` times, with a maximum of `n` attempts. The function returns `True` if the user guesses the target value (`ind` equals `n`) in the allowed number of attempts (`it` equals `k`), and `False` otherwise. The function also handles the case where the user inputs a special value (`n + 1`) to exit the game prematurely, in which case it immediately returns `False`.
