Functionality: **This function takes three positive integers as input: `tar`, `k`, and `n`, where `k` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to 10^4. It then enters a loop that continues until either `n` iterations have been reached or `k` iterations have been executed. In each iteration, the function prints a query to the user and reads an integer input from the user. If the input is equal to `n + 1`, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, the function updates its internal state based on the user's input. After the loop, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of iterations executed (`it`) is equal to `k` and the last input value (`ind`) is equal to `n`.**
