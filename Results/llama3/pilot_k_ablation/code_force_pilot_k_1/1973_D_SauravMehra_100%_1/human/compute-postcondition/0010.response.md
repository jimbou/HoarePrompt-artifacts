Functionality: **This function simulates a guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a target value (`tar`) up to `k` times, with a maximum of `n` attempts. The function returns `True` if the user guesses the target value (`ind` equals `n`) in the allowed number of attempts (`it` equals `k`), and `False` otherwise. The function also handles the case where the user inputs a special value (`n + 1`) to exit the game prematurely, in which case it immediately returns `False`.**
