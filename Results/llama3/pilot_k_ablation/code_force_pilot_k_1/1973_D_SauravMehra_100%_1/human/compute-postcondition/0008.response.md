Output State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is either `k` or the number of times the loop executed, `ind` is either `n` or the last value of `x` that was not equal to `n + 1`, `x` is an integer and is either equal to `n` or not equal to `n + 1`. Additionally, stdin contains input from the user for the number of times the loop executed.**
