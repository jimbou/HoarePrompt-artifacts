Output State: **tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n <= 10^4, it is 0, ind is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `it` and `ind`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `tar`, `k`, and `n` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The final state includes the new variables `it` and `ind` with their assigned values, along with the unchanged values of `tar`, `k`, and `n`.
