Output State: **tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n, it is 0, ind is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a variable. The first line assigns 0 to the variable `it`, and the second line assigns 0 to the variable `ind`. These assignments do not affect the initial state variables `tar`, `k`, and `n`, which remain unchanged. The final state includes the original variables and their values, as well as the newly introduced variables `it` and `ind` with their assigned values.
