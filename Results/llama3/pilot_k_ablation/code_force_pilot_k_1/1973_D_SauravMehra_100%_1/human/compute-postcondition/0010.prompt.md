You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n <= 10^4.
    it = 0
    ind = 0
    while ind < n and it < k:
        print(f'? {ind + 1} {tar}')
        
        x = int(input())
        
        if x == n + 1:
            return False
        
        ind = x
        
        it += 1
        
    #State: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is either `k` or the number of times the loop executed, `ind` is either `n` or the last value of `x` that was not equal to `n + 1`, `x` is an integer and is either equal to `n` or not equal to `n + 1`. Additionally, stdin contains input from the user for the number of times the loop executed.
    return ind == n and it == k
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether `ind` is equal to `n` and `it` is equal to `k`. `ind` is either `n` or the last value of `x` that was not equal to `n + 1`, and `it` is either `k` or the number of times the loop executed, which is provided by the user through stdin. The boolean value returned is based on the conditions that `ind` equals `n` and `it` equals `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which is less than or equal to 10^4.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is either `k` or the number of times the loop executed, `ind` is either `n` or the last value of `x` that was not equal to `n + 1`, `x` is an integer and is either equal to `n` or not equal to `n + 1`. Additionally, stdin contains input from the user for the number of times the loop executed.

Case_2: The program returns a boolean value indicating whether `ind` is equal to `n` and `it` is equal to `k`. `ind` is either `n` or the last value of `x` that was not equal to `n + 1`, and `it` is either `k` or the number of times the loop executed, which is provided by the user through stdin. The boolean value returned is based on the conditions that `ind` equals `n` and `it` equals `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which is less than or equal to 10^4.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
