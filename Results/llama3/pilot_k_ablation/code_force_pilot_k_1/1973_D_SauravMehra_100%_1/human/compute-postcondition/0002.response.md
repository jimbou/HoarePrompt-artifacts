Based on the precondition, the variables `ind` and `tar` are used in the print statement.

`ind` is initialized to 0, and `tar` is a positive integer.

The print statement is `print(f'? {ind + 1} {tar}')`.

When executed, this statement will print a string that includes the value of `ind + 1` and the value of `tar`.

Since `ind` is 0, `ind + 1` will be 1.

So, the output will be a string that includes the value 1 and the value of `tar`.

Output: **? 1 [tar] (where tar is the value of tar)**
