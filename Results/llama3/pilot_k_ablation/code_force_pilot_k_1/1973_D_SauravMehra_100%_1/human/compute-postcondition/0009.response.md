Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether `ind` is equal to `n` and `it` is equal to `k`. `ind` is either `n` or the last value of `x` that was not equal to `n + 1`, and `it` is either `k` or the number of times the loop executed, which is provided by the user through stdin. The boolean value returned is based on the conditions that `ind` equals `n` and `it` equals `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which is less than or equal to 10^4.**
