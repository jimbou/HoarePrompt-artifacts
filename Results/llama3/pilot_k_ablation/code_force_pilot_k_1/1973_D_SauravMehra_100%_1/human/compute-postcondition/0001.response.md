To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `ind < n` and `it < k`.

Given the initial state:
- `tar` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`
- `it` is 0
- `ind` is 0

For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true.

1. `ind < n`: Since `ind` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, this condition is already guaranteed to be true because 0 is less than any positive integer.

2. `it < k`: Since `it` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, this condition is also guaranteed to be true because 0 is less than any positive integer.

Given that both conditions are already satisfied with the provided state, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0**
