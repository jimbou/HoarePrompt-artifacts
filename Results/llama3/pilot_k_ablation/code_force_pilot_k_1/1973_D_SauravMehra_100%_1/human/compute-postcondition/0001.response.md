To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `ind < n and it < k`.

Given the initial state:
- `tar` is a positive integer (no direct impact on the loop condition)
- `k` is a positive integer
- `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n <= 10^4`
- `it` is 0
- `ind` is 0

The loop will execute if both conditions are met:
1. `ind < n`
2. `it < k`

Since `ind` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the first condition (`ind < n`) is always true given the initial state because 0 is less than any positive integer.

For the second condition (`it < k`), since `it` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, this condition is also true because 0 is less than any positive integer.

Given that both conditions are true with the provided initial state, no adjustments are necessary for the variables in the loop head (`ind`, `n`, `it`, `k`) to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n <= 10^4`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0**
