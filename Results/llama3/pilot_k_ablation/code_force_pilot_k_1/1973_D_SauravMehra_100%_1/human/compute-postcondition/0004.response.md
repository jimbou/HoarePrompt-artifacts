Output State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `tar`, `k`, `n`, `it`, and `ind` remain unchanged. The variable `x` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user, which is now stored in `x`. Since the input has been read, the stdin is now empty, containing no input.
