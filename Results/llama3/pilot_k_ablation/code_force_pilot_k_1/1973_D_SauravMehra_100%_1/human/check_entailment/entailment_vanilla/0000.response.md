Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the interactive problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the hidden array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`.

3. It then enters a loop to find the maximum value `mx` such that `n * mx` is a valid query. This is done by incrementing `mx` until the query `? 1 {n * mx}` returns `n`.

4. After finding `mx`, it calculates the target value `tar` as `n // k * mx`. This is the maximum possible value that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

5. The program then enters another loop to find the largest value `tar` such that `func_1(tar, k, n)` returns `True`. This function checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the maximum value `tar`.

6. If `tar` becomes less than or equal to 0, it means no such split is possible, and the program prints `! -1`.

7. Otherwise, it prints the final answer `! {tar}` and reads the response from the judge. If the response is `-1`, the program exits.

8. The `func_1` function works by iterating over the array and making queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = tar`. If it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the maximum value `tar`, it returns `True`.

Based on the problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search approach to find the largest possible value `tar` and checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with that value.

Correctness: **True**
