Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m` and then checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of length and maximum equal to `m`.

The function `func_1` is correct as it checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of length and maximum equal to `tar`. It uses a loop to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays and returns `True` if it is possible and `False` otherwise.

The main program is also correct as it reads the input, finds the maximum value `m`, and then checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of length and maximum equal to `m`. If it is possible, it prints the value of `m`, otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
