Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive game as described in the problem statement. The program first finds the maximum possible value of `m` by querying the maximum value of `f(1, n)` and then iteratively checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of their length and maximum equal to `m`. The `func_1` function correctly simulates the guessing game, returning `True` if it's possible to guess the target value `tar` in `k` attempts and `False` otherwise.

The program also correctly handles the case where the user inputs a special value (`n + 1`) to exit the game prematurely, immediately returning `False` in this case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
