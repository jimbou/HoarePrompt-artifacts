Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m` by iteratively guessing a value `tar` and checking if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of length and maximum equal to `tar`. The program also correctly handles the case where no such `m` exists and outputs `-1` in that case.

Correctness: **True**
