Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem described in the problem statement. The program first finds the maximum possible value of `m` by querying the maximum value of `f(1, n)` and then checks all possible values of `m` in descending order to find the largest one that can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays. The program uses the `func_1` function to check if a given value of `m` can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays. The `func_1` function queries the smallest positive integer `r` such that `f(l, r) = m` for each subarray and checks if the number of subarrays is equal to `k` and the last subarray ends at the end of the array.

Correctness: **True**
