Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program will always print `! -1` as the answer, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be the maximum value of `f(1, n)`, which is `n * mx` where `mx` is the maximum value in the array.

The issue is in the line `tar = n // k * mx`, which calculates the target value `tar` as `n // k * mx`. When `k` is 1, `n // k` is equal to `n`, and `tar` becomes `n * mx`, which is not the correct target value.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the case when `k` is 1 separately, and calculate the target value `tar` as `n * mx` directly.
