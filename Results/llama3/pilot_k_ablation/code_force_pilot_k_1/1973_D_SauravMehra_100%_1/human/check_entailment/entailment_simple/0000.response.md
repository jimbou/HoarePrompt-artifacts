Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum equal to `m`. 

The program first finds the maximum value `mx` in the array by asking queries of the form `? 1 x` until it gets a response of `n`. Then, it calculates the target value `tar` as `n // k * mx` and checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `tar` as the product of length and maximum. If it's not possible, it decrements `tar` by `mx` until it finds a valid `tar` or until `tar` becomes less than or equal to 0. 

The function `func_1` checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `tar` as the product of length and maximum. It does this by asking queries of the form `? ind + 1 tar` and checking if the response is `n + 1` (which means it's not possible to split the array) or if the response is a valid index `x` such that `x != n + 1`. If it's possible to split the array, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The program then prints the result and checks if the response is `-1` (which means the program made an invalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer). If the response is `-1`, the program exits. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its correctness is ensured by the careful handling of the queries and the responses. 

Correctness: **True**
