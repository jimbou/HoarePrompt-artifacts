Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program correctly calculates the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` that Alice constructs during the game, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the number is present in the `counter` dictionary. If a number is not present, it means that Alice can construct an array `c` that does not contain that number, and therefore the MEX of `c` is that number. If a number is present only once, it means that Alice can construct an array `c` that contains that number, but Bob can remove it, so the MEX of `c` is the next number. If a number is present more than once, it means that Alice can construct an array `c` that contains that number, and Bob cannot remove it, so the MEX of `c` is that number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the input array contains only one element, the case where the input array contains duplicate elements, and the case where the input array contains elements that are not present in the `counter` dictionary.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
