Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game's strategy to maximize the score for Alice and minimize it for Bob. The key insight is that Alice should prioritize picking elements that appear only once in the array, as these will contribute to the MEX score. If an element appears only once, Alice should pick it immediately, as Bob cannot remove it without increasing the MEX score. If an element appears twice, Alice can delay picking it, as Bob will eventually remove one of the copies, allowing Alice to pick the remaining copy and increase the MEX score.

The program uses a counter to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array. It then iterates through the possible MEX scores, checking if each score is present in the counter. If a score is not present, it means that Alice can pick an element that will contribute to that MEX score, and the program returns that score. If a score is present but has a frequency of 1, it means that Alice can pick that element immediately, and the program returns the next score. If a score is present with a frequency greater than 1, it means that Bob can remove one of the copies, and Alice can pick the remaining copy, so the program returns that score.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the array contains duplicate elements, when the array contains elements with frequency 1, and when the array is empty. Therefore, the program is correct.
