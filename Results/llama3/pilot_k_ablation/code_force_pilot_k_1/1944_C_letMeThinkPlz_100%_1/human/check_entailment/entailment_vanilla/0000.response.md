Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by using a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the range of `n` and checks the count of each element in the `counter` dictionary.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. If an element `i` is not present in the `counter` dictionary (i.e., its count is 0), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`, which is `i` in this case.

2. If an element `i` has a count of 1 in the `counter` dictionary and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and `ans` to `i + 1`. This is because Alice can choose the element `i` and Bob can choose the other element `i`, resulting in a MEX of `i + 1`.

3. If an element `i` has a count of 1 in the `counter` dictionary and `once` is `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can choose the element `i` and Bob cannot choose the other element `i`, resulting in a MEX of `i`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. In the second case, when `once` is `False` and an element `i` has a count of 1, the program sets `ans` to `i + 1`. But this is incorrect because Alice can choose the element `i` and Bob can choose the other element `i`, resulting in a MEX of `i`, not `i + 1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
