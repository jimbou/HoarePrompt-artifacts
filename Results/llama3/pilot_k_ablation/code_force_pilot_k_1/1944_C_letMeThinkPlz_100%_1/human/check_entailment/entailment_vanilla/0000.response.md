Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. It then iterates over the range of `n` to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once.

The program correctly handles the cases where an element occurs zero times, once, or more than once. If an element occurs zero times, it sets `ans` to that element and breaks the loop. If an element occurs once and `once` is `False`, it sets `ans` to the next element and sets `once` to `True`. If an element occurs once and `once` is `True`, it sets `ans` to that element and breaks the loop.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
