Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the list, which is the MEX of the list.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the list `n` and the list of integers `arr`. It then creates a counter dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.

The program then iterates over the range of `n` and checks if the current integer `i` is not present in the list (i.e., its count is 0) or if it appears only once in the list (i.e., its count is 1). If it finds such an integer, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. If it finds an integer that appears only once in the list and `once` is `False`, it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and sets `once` to `True`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. It also correctly handles the case where the list contains duplicate elements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
