Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the input array. It then iterates through the range of possible MEX values, checking if each value is present in the array and if it appears only once. If a value is not present or appears only once, it is considered as a potential MEX value.

The program correctly handles the cases where the MEX value is not present in the array (in which case it is the smallest positive integer not present) or where it appears only once (in which case it is the smallest positive integer that appears only once).

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy for finding the final score of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
