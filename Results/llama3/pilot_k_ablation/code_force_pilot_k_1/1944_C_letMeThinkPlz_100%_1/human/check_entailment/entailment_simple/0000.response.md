Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`. It then creates a counter dictionary `counter` to store the frequency of each element in `a`.

The program then iterates over the range of `n` and checks the frequency of each element in `counter`. If an element is not present in `counter` (i.e., its frequency is 0), it sets the answer `ans` to the current index `i` and breaks the loop. If an element has a frequency of 1 and the `once` flag is not set, it sets the `once` flag to True and sets `ans` to `i + 1`. If an element has a frequency of 1 and the `once` flag is already set, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

The program then prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the MEX of `c`. By checking the frequency of each element in `a` and setting the `once` flag accordingly, the program ensures that Alice picks the elements that will result in the maximum MEX of `c`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
