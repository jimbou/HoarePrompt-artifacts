Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array using a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number appears exactly once in the array and it's the first such number, it sets the answer to the next number. If a number appears exactly once in the array and it's not the first such number, it sets the answer to the current number and breaks the loop.

This strategy is correct because Alice wants to maximize the score, which is the MEX of the array c. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array. Therefore, Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in the array c. Bob wants to minimize the score, so he wants to remove as many small numbers as possible from the array a.

The program correctly implements this strategy by first checking if a number is not present in the array, in which case it sets the answer to that number. Then, it checks if a number appears exactly once in the array, in which case it sets the answer to the next number if it's the first such number, or to the current number if it's not the first such number.

Correctness: **True**
