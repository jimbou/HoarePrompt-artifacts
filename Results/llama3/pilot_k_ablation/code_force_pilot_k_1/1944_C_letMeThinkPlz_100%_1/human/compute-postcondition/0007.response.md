Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in arr, ans is 0, once is False, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign values to new variables. The first line assigns 0 to the variable `ans`, and the second line assigns False to the variable `once`. These assignments do not affect any of the existing variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `counter` remain unchanged. The only changes are the addition of two new variables, `ans` and `once`, with their respective values.
