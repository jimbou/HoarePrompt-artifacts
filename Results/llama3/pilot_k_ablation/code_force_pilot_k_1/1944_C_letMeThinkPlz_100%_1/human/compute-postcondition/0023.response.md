Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 * 10^5), stdin contains no input, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that appears at most once in `arr` if such an integer exists, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer that does not appear in `arr`, and `once` is True if and only if there is an integer that appears exactly once in `arr`, and the smallest integer that appears at most once in `arr` if such an integer exists, otherwise the smallest integer that does not appear in `arr` has been printed `t` times.**
