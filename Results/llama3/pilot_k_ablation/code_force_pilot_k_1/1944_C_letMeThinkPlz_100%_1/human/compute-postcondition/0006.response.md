The code snippet initializes two variables: `ans` to 0 and `once` to False. These initializations do not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `counter`, which remain unchanged. The `stdin` state also remains unaffected as the code does not interact with it.

Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1 inclusive, counter is a dictionary with each integer in arr as a key and its count as the value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is 0, once is False**
