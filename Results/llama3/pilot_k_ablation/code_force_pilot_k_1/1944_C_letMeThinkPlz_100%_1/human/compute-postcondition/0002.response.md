The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The second line assigns to `arr` a list of `n` integers from stdin. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one. The third line assigns an empty dictionary to `counter`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1 inclusive, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
