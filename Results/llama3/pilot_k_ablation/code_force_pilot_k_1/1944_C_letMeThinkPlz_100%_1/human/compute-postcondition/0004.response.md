The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer and `i` is now the first integer in the list.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input, `i` is the first integer in the list**
