The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the smallest integer that appears at most once in the list `arr` if such an integer exists, otherwise it is the smallest integer that does not appear in `arr`. The exact value of `ans` depends on the contents of the list `arr`, but based on the precondition, we can conclude that `ans` will be the smallest integer that meets one of these two conditions.

Output: **the smallest integer that appears at most once in the list arr if such an integer exists, otherwise the smallest integer that does not appear in arr**
