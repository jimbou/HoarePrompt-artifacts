The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4), the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive).

The input still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been read and assigned to `t`. Each test case still contains two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).**
