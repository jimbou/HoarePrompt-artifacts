Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, `counter` is a dictionary with each integer in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, indicating that the integer `i` does not exist in the `arr` list or its count is 0.**
