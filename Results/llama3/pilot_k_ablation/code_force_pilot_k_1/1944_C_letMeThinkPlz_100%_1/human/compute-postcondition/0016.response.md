Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, `counter` is a dictionary with each integer in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, then `ans` is `i`, `once` is False, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `once` is True, and the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 1.***
