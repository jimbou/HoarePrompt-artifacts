Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is 0. If the count of the integer at index `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is False.***
