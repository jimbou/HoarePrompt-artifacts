The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 2 * 10^5), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line of the first test case has been read.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `t` now holds the value of the first integer in the first test case, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The standard input still contains the remaining test cases, but the first line of the first test case has been consumed.
