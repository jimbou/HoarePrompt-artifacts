To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i < n)**
