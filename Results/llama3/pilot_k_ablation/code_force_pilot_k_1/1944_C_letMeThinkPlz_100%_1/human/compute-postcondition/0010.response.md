The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line breaks out of the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it has no effect.

Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is at least 1, arr is a list of integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in arr, ans is 0, once is False, stdin contains no input, i is 0**
