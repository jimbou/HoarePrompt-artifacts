The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of the list `x` and the first element of the list `a` to the end of the list `x`. The second line appends the index of the newly added element in the list `x` to the list of indices in the dictionary `inds` that corresponds to the newly added element.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, x is a list containing two elements: 0 and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element of the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing two elements: 0 and the index of the newly added element in the list x, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
