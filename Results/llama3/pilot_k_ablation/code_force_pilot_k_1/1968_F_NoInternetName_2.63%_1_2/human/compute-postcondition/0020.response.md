Functionality: This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given range [l, r] in the input list 'a' such that the cumulative bitwise XOR of the subarray is equal to the cumulative bitwise XOR of the entire list 'a' up to index 'r'. It takes as input a list of non-negative integers 'a' and a range [l, r], and outputs 'Yes' if such a subarray exists and 'No' otherwise. The function performs this check for 'q' number of queries, where each query specifies a range [l, r]. The function modifies the input list 'a' by computing the cumulative bitwise XOR of its elements and storing it in list 'x', and also creates a dictionary 'inds' to store the indices where each cumulative bitwise XOR value appears in 'x'.
