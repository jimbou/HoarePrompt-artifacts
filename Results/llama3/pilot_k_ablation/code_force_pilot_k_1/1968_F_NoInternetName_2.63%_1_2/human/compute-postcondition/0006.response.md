Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `x` is a list containing the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `x` and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the return values of `func_1(int)`, but the exact values of `l` and `r` are unknown since the return values of `func_1(int)` are unknown. The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.***
