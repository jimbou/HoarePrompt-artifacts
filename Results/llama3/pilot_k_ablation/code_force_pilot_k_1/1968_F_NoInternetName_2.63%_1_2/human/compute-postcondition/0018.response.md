Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in a, inds is a dictionary where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, i is 0, lower is the index in inds[x[r]] that is greater than lower and less than l, upper is the index in inds[x[l - 1]] that is less than or equal to r. If upper is greater than lower and both l and upper are within the range from l to r (inclusive), and both l and lower are within the range from l to r (inclusive), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
