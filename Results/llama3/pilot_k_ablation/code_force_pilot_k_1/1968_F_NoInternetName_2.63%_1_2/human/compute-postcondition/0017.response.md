Output: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in a, inds is a dictionary where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, i is 0, lower is the index in inds[x[r]] that is greater than lower and less than l, upper is the index in inds[x[l - 1]] that is less than or equal to r. Either upper is less than or equal to lower, or upper is less than l, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than or equal to l, or lower is greater than r, and 'No' is being printed**
