Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether a subarray is interesting by checking if the XOR of its elements can be divided into k equal parts.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first calculates the XOR of all elements in the array and stores it in the `x` list. This is done to efficiently calculate the XOR of any subarray in O(1) time.

2. The program then creates a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of the elements in the `x` list. This is done to efficiently find the lower and upper bounds of the subarray that has the same XOR as the query subarray.

3. For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray is equal to the XOR of the entire array. If it is, the program prints "Yes" because the subarray can be divided into k equal parts.

4. If the XOR of the subarray is not equal to the XOR of the entire array, the program uses binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of the subarray that has the same XOR as the query subarray. If the lower and upper bounds are within the query subarray, the program prints "Yes" because the subarray can be divided into k equal parts. Otherwise, the program prints "No".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when the query subarray has a length of 1, when the query subarray has a length of n, and when the XOR of the query subarray is equal to the XOR of the entire array.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
