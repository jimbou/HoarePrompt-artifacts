Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether a given subarray within a larger array is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.

2. The program uses a cumulative XOR approach to efficiently calculate the XOR of subarrays. It maintains a list `x` where `x[i]` represents the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements in the input array `a`.

3. The program also uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices at which each cumulative XOR value appears. This allows for efficient lookup of indices where a specific XOR value occurs.

4. For each query, the program checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` has a cumulative XOR equal to the cumulative XOR of the entire array up to `r`. If so, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next query.

5. If the cumulative XORs are not equal, the program uses the `func_2` function to find the first index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l`. It also finds the last index `upper` in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

6. The program then checks if there exists an index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` and an index `upper` in `inds[x[l - 1]]` such that `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r`. If such indices exist, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The program correctly implements the required logic to determine whether a subarray is "interesting" based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
