Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray within a given range is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k consecutive segments such that the bitwise XOR of elements from each part are equal.

The program first calculates the cumulative bitwise XOR of the input list 'a' and stores it in the list 'x'. It also creates a dictionary 'inds' where each key is an element in 'x' and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in 'x'.

Then, for each query, the program checks if the cumulative bitwise XOR of the subarray from index 'l' to 'r' is equal to the cumulative bitwise XOR of the entire list 'a' from index 0 to 'r'. If it is, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists an index 'lower' in 'inds[x[r]]' such that 'lower' is less than 'l' and an index 'upper' in 'inds[x[l - 1]]' such that 'upper' is greater than or equal to 'r'. If both 'lower' and 'upper' exist and 'upper' is greater than 'lower', the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program uses the external functions 'func_1' and 'func_2' to obtain input values and search for the first index in a list where a given predicate is true, respectively.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
