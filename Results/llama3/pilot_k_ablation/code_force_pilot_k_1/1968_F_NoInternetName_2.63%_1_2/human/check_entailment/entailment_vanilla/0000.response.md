Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is interesting based on the XOR of its elements. The program uses a combination of functions to achieve this.

Function 1, `func_1`, is used to read input from the user and convert it into a list of integers. This function is used to read the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, and the queries.

Function 2, `func_2`, is a binary search function that is used to find the index of an element in a list that satisfies a given predicate. This function is used to find the indices of the XOR values in the `inds` dictionary.

Function 3, `func_3`, is the main function that solves the problem. It reads the input, calculates the XOR values of the array, and stores them in the `x` list. It also creates a dictionary `inds` that maps each XOR value to its indices in the `x` list.

The program then iterates over the queries. For each query, it checks if the XOR value of the subarray is equal to the XOR value of the entire array. If it is, the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it uses the `func_2` function to find the indices of the XOR values in the `inds` dictionary. If the indices are found and the subarray is interesting, the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to find the indices of the XOR values and to determine whether a subarray is interesting.

Correctness: **True**
