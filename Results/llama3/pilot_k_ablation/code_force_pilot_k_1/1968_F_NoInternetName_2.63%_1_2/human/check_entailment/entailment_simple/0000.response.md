Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem of determining whether a subarray is interesting or not. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first calculates the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`. This is done to efficiently calculate the XOR of any subarray in constant time.

2. It then creates a dictionary `inds` where each key is an element in `x` and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`. This is done to efficiently find the indices of a given XOR value.

3. For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `1` to `l-1`. If they are equal, it means that the subarray from `l` to `r` is interesting, so it prints 'Yes'.

4. If the XOR values are not equal, the program uses binary search to find the indices of the XOR values `x[l-1]` and `x[r]` in the list `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l-1]]` respectively. 

5. It then checks if there exists a pair of indices `lower` and `upper` such that `lower` is greater than `l`, `upper` is less than or equal to `r`, and the XOR of the subarray from `lower` to `upper` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r`. If such a pair exists, it means that the subarray from `l` to `r` is interesting, so it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
