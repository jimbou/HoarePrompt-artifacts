Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` and prints a string of '1 ' repeated `k` times if they are equal, or -1 if they are not.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual values of `n` and `k`. For example, if `n` is 3 and `k` is 1, the program will print -1, but there is a valid solution: [69, 420, 69, 420] (as shown in the example output).

Moreover, the program does not generate an array `a` that satisfies the problem's requirements. It only prints a string of '1 ' repeated `k` times, which is not a valid solution.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
