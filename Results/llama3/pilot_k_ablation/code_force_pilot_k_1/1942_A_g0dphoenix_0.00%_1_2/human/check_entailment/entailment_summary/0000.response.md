Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` and prints a string of '1 ' repeated `k` times if they are equal, or -1 if they are not. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

For example, if `n` is 3 and `k` is 1, the program will print -1, but a valid solution exists: `[69420, 69, 420]`. This array has exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift: `[69, 420, 69420]`.

Additionally, the program does not consider the case where `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, a valid solution can be constructed by having `n-1` elements equal to 1 and the last element equal to a large number (e.g., 69420). This will result in exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide a valid solution for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
