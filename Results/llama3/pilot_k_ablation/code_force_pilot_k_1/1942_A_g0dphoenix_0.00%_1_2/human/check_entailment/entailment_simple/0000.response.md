Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks if n is equal to k, and if so, it prints a string of '1 ' repeated n times, excluding the last space character. However, this solution does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all cases.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints -1, but a valid array a = [69420, 69, 420] exists, as shown in the problem's example.

The program also does not handle cases where n is greater than k and n is not equal to k. In such cases, the program should print -1 if no valid array a exists, or print a valid array a if one exists.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
