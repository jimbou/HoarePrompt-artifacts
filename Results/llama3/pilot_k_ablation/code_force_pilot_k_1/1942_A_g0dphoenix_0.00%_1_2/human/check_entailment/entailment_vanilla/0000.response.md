Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple approach: if `n` is equal to `k`, it prints an array of all ones, which has `n` sorted cyclic shifts. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that no such array exists.

However, this approach is incomplete. The problem statement allows for more complex arrays, where not all elements are equal. For example, the array `[69, 420, 69420]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, as shown in the example output.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n` but not equal to 1. In such cases, it is possible to construct an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, but the program does not attempt to do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible cases and does not provide a correct solution for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
