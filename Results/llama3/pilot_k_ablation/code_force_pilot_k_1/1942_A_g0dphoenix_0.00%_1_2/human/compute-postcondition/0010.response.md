Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, if n is equal to k, it prints a string of '1 ' repeated k times, excluding the last space character. If n is not equal to k, it prints -1. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point standard input is empty.**
