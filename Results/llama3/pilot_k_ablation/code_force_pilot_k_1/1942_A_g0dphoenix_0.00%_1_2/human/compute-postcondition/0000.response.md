The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
