The code accepts an input and assigns it to `n` and `k`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `int(input())` is greater than 0, the first input is read and assigned to `n` and `k`. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). The value of `_` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and `_` is 0**
