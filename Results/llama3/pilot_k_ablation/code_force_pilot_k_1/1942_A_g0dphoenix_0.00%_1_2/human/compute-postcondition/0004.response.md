The code prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, excluding the last space character. Since `n` is equal to `k`, the string will be repeated `k` times.
Output: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and `_` is 0. The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, and this is printed: a string of '1 ' repeated `k` times, excluding the last space character**
