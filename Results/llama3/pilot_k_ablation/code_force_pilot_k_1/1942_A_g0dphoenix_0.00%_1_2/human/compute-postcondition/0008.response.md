Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and `_` is 0. If `n` is equal to `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated `k` times, excluding the last space character, is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
