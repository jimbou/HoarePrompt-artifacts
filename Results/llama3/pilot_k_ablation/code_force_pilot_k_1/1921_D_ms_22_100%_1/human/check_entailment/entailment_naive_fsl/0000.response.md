Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The program first sorts both arrays a and b in ascending order. Then, it uses two pointers, a1 and a2, to traverse array a from both ends, and two pointers, b1 and b2, to traverse array b from both ends. At each step, it calculates the absolute differences between the current elements of a and b at the four possible pairs of positions (a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a2, b1), and (a2, b2). It then chooses the pair with the maximum difference and adds it to the total difference ans. The pointers are then moved accordingly to ensure that the same elements are not compared again.

This approach ensures that the maximum total difference is obtained by comparing each element of a with the most different element of b, which is the key insight to solve this problem.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where n = 1 or m = 1, and it produces the correct output for all the examples provided. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
