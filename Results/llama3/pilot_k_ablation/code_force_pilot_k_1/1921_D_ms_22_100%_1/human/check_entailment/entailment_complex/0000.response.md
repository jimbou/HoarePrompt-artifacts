Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` integers `a_i` and `m` integers `b_i`.
2.  It sorts the lists `a` and `b` in ascending order, which is necessary for finding the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`.
3.  The program then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` by comparing the differences between the smallest and largest elements of `a` and `b`. This is done by maintaining two pointers, `a1` and `a2`, for the list `a`, and two pointers, `b1` and `b2`, for the list `b`. The pointers are moved based on the comparisons of the absolute differences.
4.  The program prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each test case.

The execution states of the program provided as comments are consistent with the expected behavior of the program. The program correctly handles the input and output for each test case, and the variables are updated correctly based on the comparisons and calculations.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
