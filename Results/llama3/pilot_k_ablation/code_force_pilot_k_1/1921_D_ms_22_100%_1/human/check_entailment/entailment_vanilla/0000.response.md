Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of array b to be as different as possible from array a.

The given program sorts both arrays a and b, and then uses four pointers (a1, a2, b1, b2) to compare the differences between the elements of the two arrays. The program calculates the differences between the current elements of the two arrays (dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4) and chooses the maximum difference to add to the total difference ans.

The program correctly handles the cases where the maximum difference is obtained by comparing the smallest element of a with the smallest element of b, the smallest element of a with the largest element of b, the largest element of a with the smallest element of b, or the largest element of a with the largest element of b.

The program also correctly updates the pointers after adding the maximum difference to the total difference.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
