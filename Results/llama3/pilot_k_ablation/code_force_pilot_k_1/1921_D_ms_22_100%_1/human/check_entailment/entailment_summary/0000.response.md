Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of the second array to be as different as possible from the first array. It sorts both arrays and then iterates through them, comparing the differences between the closest elements to determine the sum of absolute differences. The program handles multiple test cases and prints the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
