Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` integers `a_i` and `m` integers `b_i`.
2.  It sorts the lists `a` and `b` in ascending order, which is necessary for finding the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`.
3.  The program then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` by comparing the differences between the smallest and largest elements of `a` and `b`. This is done by maintaining two pointers, `a1` and `a2`, for the list `a`, and two pointers, `b1` and `b2`, for the list `b`. The pointers are moved based on the comparisons of the absolute differences.
4.  Finally, the program prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each test case.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, correctly calculating and printing the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
