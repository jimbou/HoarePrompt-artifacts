Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The current value of dif1 is greater than dif2. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b.**

The code adds the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b to ans, increments a1 and b1 by 1, and updates the values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 based on the new positions of a1 and b1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
