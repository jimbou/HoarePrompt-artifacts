To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `a1 <= a2`. Given the initial state, `a1` is 0 and `a2` is `n-1`, where `n` is a positive integer.

Since `a1` is 0 and `a2` is `n-1`, the condition `a1 <= a2` will always be true for any positive integer `n` because 0 is always less than or equal to `n-1` when `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states of `a1` and `a2` are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The loop can certainly execute one time based on the given initial state.

State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-1, ans is 0**
