Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m, followed by n and m space-separated integers, respectively. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the closest elements in the two sorted lists of integers and prints this sum for each test case. The function iterates through the test cases, sorting the input lists and comparing the differences between the closest elements to determine the sum of absolute differences. The function does not modify the input lists or the standard input stream, but rather processes the test cases and prints the results.**
