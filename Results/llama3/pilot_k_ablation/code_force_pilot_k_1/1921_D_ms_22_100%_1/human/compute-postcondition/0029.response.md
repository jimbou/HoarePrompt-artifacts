Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and the current value of dif4 is greater than dif2**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`. It then decrements `a2` and `b2` by 1, effectively moving the pointers for the last elements of `a` and `b` one step to the left. The values of `a1`, `b1`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` also remain valid.
