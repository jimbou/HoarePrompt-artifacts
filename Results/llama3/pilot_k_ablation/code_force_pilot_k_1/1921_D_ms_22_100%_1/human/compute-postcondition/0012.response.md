Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers. If dif3 is greater than dif1, then a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and the current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif1. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1.**
