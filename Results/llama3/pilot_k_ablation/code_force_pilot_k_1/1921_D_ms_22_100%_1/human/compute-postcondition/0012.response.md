Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n-1 or n-2, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus either dif1 or dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between either the first or second element of a and either the first or second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between either the first or second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between either the last or second last element of a and either the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i.***
