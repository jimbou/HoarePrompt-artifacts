The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the program is running as the main module and stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains the number of test cases `t`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, the second line contains n integers a_i, and the third line contains m integers b_i.**
