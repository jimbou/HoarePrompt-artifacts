The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains three lines, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

The value of `t` is now an integer, and it represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, but the first line of the first test case has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i.**
