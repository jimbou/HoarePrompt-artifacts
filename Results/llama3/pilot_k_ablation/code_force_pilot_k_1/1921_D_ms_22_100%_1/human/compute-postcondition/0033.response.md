Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, b1 and b2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, ans is updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is either greater than or less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and the current value of dif4 is either greater than or less than or equal to dif2.***
