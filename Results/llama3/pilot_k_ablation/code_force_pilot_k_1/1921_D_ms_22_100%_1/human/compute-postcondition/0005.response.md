Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-1, ans is 0, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.**

In this output state, the values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are calculated based on the initial values of a, b, a1, a2, b1, and b2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
