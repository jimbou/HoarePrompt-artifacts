Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-1, ans is 0, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i**

The code calculates the absolute differences between the first and last elements of the sorted lists `a` and `b`, and assigns these differences to the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases.
