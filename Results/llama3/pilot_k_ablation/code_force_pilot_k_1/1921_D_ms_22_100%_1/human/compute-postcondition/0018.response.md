Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers. If the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is greater than the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, then a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b. In both cases, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of the updated a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the updated a and the last element of the updated b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of the updated a and the first element of the updated b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of the updated a and b. The current value of dif1 is greater than dif2. The absolute difference between the last element of the updated a and the first element of the updated b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of the updated a and b. The absolute difference between the last elements of the updated a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first elements of the updated a and b.***
