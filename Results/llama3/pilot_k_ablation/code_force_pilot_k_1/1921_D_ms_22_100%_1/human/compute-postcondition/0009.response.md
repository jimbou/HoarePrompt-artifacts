Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b. The current value of dif1 is greater than or equal to dif2. The current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif1.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`. Then, it decrements `a2` by 1, effectively moving the second pointer in `a` one step to the left. Finally, it increments `b1` by 1, effectively moving the first pointer in `b` one step to the right. As a result, the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new positions of the pointers in `a` and `b`.
