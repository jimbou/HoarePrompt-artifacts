Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`. Then, it decrements `a2` by 1, effectively moving the second pointer in `a` one step to the left. Finally, it increments `b1` by 1, effectively moving the first pointer in `b` one step to the right. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` are not affected by the code, but their values change because the pointers in `a` and `b` have moved. The value of `dif3` also changes because the second last element of `a` is now being compared with the first element of `b`. The remaining test cases in stdin are not affected by the code.
