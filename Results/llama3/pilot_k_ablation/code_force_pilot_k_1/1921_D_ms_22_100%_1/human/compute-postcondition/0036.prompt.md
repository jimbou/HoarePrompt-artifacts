You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes 1 time. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a non negative integer, `fac` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    fac *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `fac` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**

Your Task:

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-1, ans is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i
Code of the loop:
```
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i. If dif1 > dif2, then either dif3 > dif4 or dif3 <= dif4. If dif3 > dif4, then a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n-1 or n-2, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus either dif1 or dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between either the first or second element of a and either the first or second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between either the first or second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between either the last or second last element of a and either the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is equal to its original value plus the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. If dif1 <= dif2, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, b1 and b2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, ans is updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is either greater than or less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and the current value of dif4 is either greater than or less than or equal to dif2.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
