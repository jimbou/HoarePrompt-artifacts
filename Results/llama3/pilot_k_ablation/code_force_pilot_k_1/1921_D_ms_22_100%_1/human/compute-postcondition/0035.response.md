Postcondition: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i. If dif1 > dif2, then either dif3 > dif4 or dif3 <= dif4. If dif3 > dif4, then a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n-1 or n-2, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is m-1, ans is the original value of ans plus either dif1 or dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between either the first or second element of a and either the first or second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between either the first or second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between either the last or second last element of a and either the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is equal to its original value plus the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. If dif1 <= dif2, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, b1 and b2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, ans is updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif2, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is either greater than or less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and the current value of dif4 is either greater than or less than or equal to dif2.**
