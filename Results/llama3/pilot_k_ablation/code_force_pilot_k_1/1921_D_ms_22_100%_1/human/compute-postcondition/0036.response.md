The code prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of lists `a` and `b`.
Since the exact values of the elements in lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the maximum absolute differences.
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of lists a and b)**
