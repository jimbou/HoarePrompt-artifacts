Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4. The current value of dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, the current value of dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, the current value of dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, the current value of dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last elements of a and b. The current value of dif1 is greater than dif2. The absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second last elements of a and b. The current value of dif4 is greater than dif1.**
