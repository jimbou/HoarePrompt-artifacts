Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` also remain the same as they are not affected by the code. The value of `a2` is decremented by 1, and the value of `b2` is also decremented by 1. The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif4`. The remaining test cases in `stdin` are not affected by the code.
