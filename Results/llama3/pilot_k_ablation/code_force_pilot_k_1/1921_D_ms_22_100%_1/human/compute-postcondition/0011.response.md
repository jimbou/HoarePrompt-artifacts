Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by the original value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`. The values of `a1` and `b1` have been incremented by 1, moving the pointers to the second elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` have been updated accordingly, reflecting the new positions of the pointers. The remaining variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
