Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It sorts the lists a and b, then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and b by comparing the differences between the smallest and largest elements of a and b. The function prints the sum of these maximum absolute differences for each test case.**
