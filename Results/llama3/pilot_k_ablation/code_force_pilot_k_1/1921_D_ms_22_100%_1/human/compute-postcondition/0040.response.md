Postcondition: **The program processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads two positive integers n and m, followed by n and m space-separated integers, respectively. The program then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the closest elements in the two sorted lists of integers and prints this sum for each test case. If the program is run as the main module, it executes this process; otherwise, it does not perform any actions.**
