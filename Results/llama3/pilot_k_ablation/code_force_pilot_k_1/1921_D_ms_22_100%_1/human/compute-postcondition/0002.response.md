According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the number of test cases. The number of test cases being a number does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, the second line contains n integers a_i, and the third line contains m integers b_i**
