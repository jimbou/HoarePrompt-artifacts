To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer. Being an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i**
