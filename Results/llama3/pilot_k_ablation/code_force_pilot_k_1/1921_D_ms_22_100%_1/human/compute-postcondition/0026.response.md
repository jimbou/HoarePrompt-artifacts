Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers. If dif3 is greater than dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n-2, b1 is 1, b2 is m-1, and ans is the original value of ans plus dif3. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of b, the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, the current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b.***
