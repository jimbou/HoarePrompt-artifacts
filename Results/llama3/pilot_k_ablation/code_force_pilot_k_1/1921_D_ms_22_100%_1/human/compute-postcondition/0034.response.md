Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers. The values of a1, a2, b1, b2, ans, dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated based on the comparisons between dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison between dif3 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1, a2, b1, and b2 are updated based on the comparison between the absolute differences of the elements of a and b, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1, a2, b1, and b2 are updated based on the comparison between dif3 and dif2, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1, a2, b1, and b2 are updated based on the comparison between the absolute differences of the elements of a and b, and ans is updated accordingly. In all cases, the updated values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are calculated based on the new values of a1, a2, b1, and b2. The absolute differences between the elements of a and b are updated accordingly.***
