Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is dif2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing two lines: the second line with n space-separated integers a_i and the third line with m space-separated integers b_i, the absolute difference between the second elements of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b, the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`. It then increments `a1` by 1, effectively moving the starting index of `a` one position to the right. Finally, it decrements `b2` by 1, effectively moving the ending index of `b` one position to the left. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly, reflecting the new positions of `a1` and `b2`. The remaining variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
