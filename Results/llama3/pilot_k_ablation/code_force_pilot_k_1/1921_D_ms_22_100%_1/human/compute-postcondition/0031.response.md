Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, which is `dif2`. The value of `a1` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `b2` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
