Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n-1, b1 is 0, b2 is m-2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of b, the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, the current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b.**

The code increments `ans` by the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` (dif2), increments `a1` by 1, and decrements `b2` by 1. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `b1`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The relationships between the variables also remain valid, with the updated values of `a1`, `b2`, and `ans`.
