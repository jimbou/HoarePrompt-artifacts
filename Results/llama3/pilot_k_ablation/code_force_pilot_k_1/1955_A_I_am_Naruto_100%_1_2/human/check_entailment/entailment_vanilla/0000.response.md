Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (a) and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

2. The program defines a function `func()` that iterates over the number of test cases specified in the input.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b) from the input.

4. It calculates two possible costs:
   - `s1`: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
   - `s2`: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion. It calculates this by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (b * (n // 2)), and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (n % 2 * a).

5. It prints the minimum of these two costs (`min(s1, s2)`).

6. The program correctly handles the cases where it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the regular price or using the promotion.

7. The program also correctly handles the cases where the number of yogurts is odd, by buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

8. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
