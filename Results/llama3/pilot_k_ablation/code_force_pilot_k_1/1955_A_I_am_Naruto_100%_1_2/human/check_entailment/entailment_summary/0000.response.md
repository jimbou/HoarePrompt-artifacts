Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. It calculates two possible costs:
   - s1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n times a).
   - s2: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion. This is calculated by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (b times the integer division of n by 2), and then buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price (a if n is odd).
4. It prints the minimum of these two costs, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the different scenarios presented in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
