Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program calculates two possible costs:

- s1: the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a)
- s2: the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion (b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is even or odd, and it correctly calculates the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
