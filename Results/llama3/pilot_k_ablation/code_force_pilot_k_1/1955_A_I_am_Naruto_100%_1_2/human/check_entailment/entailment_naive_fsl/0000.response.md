Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". It considers two scenarios: buying all yogurts at the regular price (s1) and buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price with the remaining yogurt(s) at the regular price (s2). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If n is even, the program buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, which is the optimal solution.
* If n is odd, the program buys all but one yogurt in pairs at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.
* If the promotion price is not advantageous (i.e., b > 2a), the program buys all yogurts at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when n = 1 or when a = b.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
