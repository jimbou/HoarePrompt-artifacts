Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. It calculates two sums: s1 (n times a) and s2 (b times the integer division of n by 2, plus a if n is odd). This is the key part of the program.
4. The program then prints the minimum of these two sums.

The logic behind calculating s1 and s2 is correct. s1 represents the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a), while s2 represents the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price (b) as much as possible, and buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price (a).

The program correctly handles the case where n is odd by adding a to s2, which accounts for the extra yogurt that cannot be bought in pairs.

The program also correctly prints the minimum of s1 and s2, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
