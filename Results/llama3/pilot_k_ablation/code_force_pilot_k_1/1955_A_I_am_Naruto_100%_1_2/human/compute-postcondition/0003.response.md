The code prints the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`. Where `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`, and `s2` is the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2, plus `a` if `n` is odd.
Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2, plus a if n is odd, stdin contains t inputs: each containing three integers n, a, and b, input() is at least 1, _ is 0, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed**
