Functionality: **Reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates two sums: s1 (n times a) and s2 (b times the integer division of n by 2, plus a if n is odd). It then prints the minimum of these two sums. This process is repeated for a number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.**
