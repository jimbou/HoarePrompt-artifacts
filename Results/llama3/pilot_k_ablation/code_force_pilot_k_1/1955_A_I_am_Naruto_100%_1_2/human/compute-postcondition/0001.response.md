Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2, plus a if n is odd, stdin contains t inputs: each containing three integers n, a, and b, input() is at least 1, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the first line of the code, which assigns the values of the first three inputs to these variables. The value of `s1` is calculated as the product of `n` and `a`, while the value of `s2` is calculated as the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2, plus `a` if `n` is odd. The remaining inputs in stdin are reduced by one, as the first line of the code consumes one input. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
