To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), so for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and q is 0.
