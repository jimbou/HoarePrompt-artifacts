Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), q is 0, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, ans is the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 or x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0.**
