Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), q is 0, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, ans is 1**

The code first reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `x` and `n`. Since `q` is not modified by the code, its value remains 0. The variable `ans` is assigned the value 1. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed, leaving `t-1` lines remaining. The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the integers read from stdin, which are between 1 and 10^8 inclusive for `x`, and between 1 and `x` inclusive for `n`.
