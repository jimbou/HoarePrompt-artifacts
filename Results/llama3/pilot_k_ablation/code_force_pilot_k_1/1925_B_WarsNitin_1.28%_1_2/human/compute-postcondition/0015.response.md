Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair represents a number x and a multiplier n. For each pair, it calculates and prints the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and divisible by x // i. The function processes all input pairs and prints the maximum divisor for each pair, leaving the input stream empty after execution.**
