The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that either `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` or `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.

Here, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, and `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the given conditions.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **the maximum divisor i of x such that either x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 or x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0 (where x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive and n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive)**
