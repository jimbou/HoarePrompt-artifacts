Postcondition: ***stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), q is 0, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, ans is the maximum of the current value of ans (which is 1) and i (which is 1), i is 1, and the current value of x is divisible by i. If the current value of x minus n times i is greater than or equal to 0, and the result of this subtraction is divisible by i, then ans is the maximum of the current value of ans (which is 1) and i (which is 1).***
