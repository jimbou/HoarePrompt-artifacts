Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3) followed by `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` (which is 1), `i` is 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The input contains an integer `t` followed by `t-1` lines of two integers `x` and `n`. The variable `q` is still 0. The values of `x` and `n` are within their specified ranges. The variable `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the current value of `i` (1), which means `ans` is now 1. The value of `i` is still 1. The divisibility conditions for `x` and the subtraction of `n` times `i` from `x` are still satisfied.
