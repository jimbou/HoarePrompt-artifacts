According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop will only execute if `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, which means `x` must be at least 1. Since `x` is already at least 1, we can conclude that `x` is at least 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), q is 0, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, ans is 1, i is 1**
