Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of k, x, and a. It then calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee winning any number of coins. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row, and calculating the total amount of coins he needs to have in order to recover from these losses.

The program uses the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` to calculate the total amount of coins Sasha needs to have. This formula is derived from the fact that if Sasha loses a bet, he needs to have enough coins to recover from the loss, which is `s // (k - 1) + 1` coins. The `+ 1` is necessary because Sasha needs to have at least one coin to place a bet.

Finally, the program prints 'YES' if Sasha's initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum amount `s`, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
