To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, the first test case is available to be read**
