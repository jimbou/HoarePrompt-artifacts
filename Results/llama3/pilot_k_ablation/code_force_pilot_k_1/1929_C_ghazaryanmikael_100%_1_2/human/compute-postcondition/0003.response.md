Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`. The integer division `s // (k-1)` means that the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number. The value of `s` was initially 1, so the new value of `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
