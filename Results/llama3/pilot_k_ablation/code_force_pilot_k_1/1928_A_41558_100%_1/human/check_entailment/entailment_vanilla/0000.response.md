Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving them.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the size of the rectangle.

3. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.
   - If `a` is equal to `2*b` or `b` is equal to `2*a` and the smaller side is odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle can only be cut into two identical rectangles.

4. If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct and covers all possible cases. It correctly identifies when the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and when these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
