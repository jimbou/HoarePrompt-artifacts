Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
2. If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'. This is because in these cases, the only possible cut would result in two identical rectangles, which is not considered a different rectangle.
3. In all other cases, it is possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
