Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

The program first reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the size of the rectangle.

The program then checks three conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to form another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

2. If `a` is equal to `2*b` and `b` is odd, or if `b` is equal to `2*a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO' because in these cases, the only possible cut is into two rectangles of the same size, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
