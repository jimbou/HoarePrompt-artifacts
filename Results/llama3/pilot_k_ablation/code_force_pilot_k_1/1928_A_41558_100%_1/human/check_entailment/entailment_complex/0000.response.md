Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to divide a rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.

The program first checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to divide the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.

Then, it checks if `a` is equal to `2*b` or `b` is equal to `2*a`, and if the other dimension is odd. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to divide the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.

In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to divide the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
