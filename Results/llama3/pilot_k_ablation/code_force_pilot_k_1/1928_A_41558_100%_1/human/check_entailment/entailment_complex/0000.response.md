Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The conditions for printing 'YES' are:

1. If both numbers are even, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles, and then these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle.
2. If one number is twice the other and the other is odd, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles, one of which is twice the size of the other, and then these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle.

The conditions for printing 'NO' are:

1. If both numbers are odd, it means that the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal rectangles, and therefore, another rectangle cannot be formed.
2. If one number is twice the other and the other is odd, but the larger number is not twice the smaller number, it means that the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can be used to form another rectangle.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
