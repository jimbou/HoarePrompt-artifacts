Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two equal halves with integer dimensions. The program checks for the following conditions:

1. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to cut the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.
2. If one dimension is half of the other and the other dimension is odd, it is not possible to cut the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.
3. In all other cases, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions.

The program correctly handles these conditions and prints 'YES' if it is possible to cut the rectangle and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
