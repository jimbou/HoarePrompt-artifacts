Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The logic is as follows:

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
- If `a` is equal to `2*b` or `b` is equal to `2*a` and the other dimension is odd, it's also not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
- In all other cases, it's possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1. The logic is sound and the program produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
