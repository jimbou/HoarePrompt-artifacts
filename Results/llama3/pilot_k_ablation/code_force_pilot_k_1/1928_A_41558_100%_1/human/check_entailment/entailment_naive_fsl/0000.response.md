Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a = 2 and b = 1. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the 2 \times 1 rectangle into two 1 \times 1 rectangles, and from these, only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same. However, the program prints "YES" for this case, which is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if a or b is odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a and the other is odd. However, it does not consider the case when a and b are both even, but a is not equal to 2*b or b is not equal to 2*a. In this case, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides, but the program will incorrectly print "NO".

For example, when a = 4 and b = 2, the program will print "NO", but Bob can cut the 4 \times 2 rectangle into two 2 \times 2 rectangles, and from these, the 4 \times 1 rectangle can be formed, which is different from the 4 \times 2 rectangle.
