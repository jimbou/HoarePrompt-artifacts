Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even. The current value of `a` and `b` is such that either `a` is half of `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is half of `a` and `a` is odd, and 'NO' is being printed**
