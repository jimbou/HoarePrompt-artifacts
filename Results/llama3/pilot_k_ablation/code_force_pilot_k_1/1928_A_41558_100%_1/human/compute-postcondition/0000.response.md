The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This integer is assigned to `n`. The remaining lines in stdin still contain two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) for each of the `t` lines.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
