Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) â€” the size of Bob's rectangle.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers a and b, which represent the size of Bob's rectangle. The values of a and b are still between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
