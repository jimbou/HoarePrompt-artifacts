Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been read and processed.
