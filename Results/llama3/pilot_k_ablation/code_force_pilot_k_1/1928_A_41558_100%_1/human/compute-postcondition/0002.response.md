Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n-1` lines of input, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of input, which are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `n-1` lines of input, each containing two integers, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
