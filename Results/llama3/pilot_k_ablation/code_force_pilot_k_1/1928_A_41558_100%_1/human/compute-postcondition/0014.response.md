Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed. 'NO' is printed if either `a` is half of `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is half of `a` and `a` is odd. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
