Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n-1` lines of input, each containing two integers. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even (or both are even), then if either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
