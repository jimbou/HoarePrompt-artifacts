The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute, so `n` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) â€” the size of Bob's rectangle.**
