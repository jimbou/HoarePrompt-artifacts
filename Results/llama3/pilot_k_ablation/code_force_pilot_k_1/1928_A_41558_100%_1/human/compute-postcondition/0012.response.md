Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n-1` lines of input, each containing two integers. Either `a` is even or `b` is even (or both are even). Additionally, it is not the case that `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`, and 'YES' is being printed**
