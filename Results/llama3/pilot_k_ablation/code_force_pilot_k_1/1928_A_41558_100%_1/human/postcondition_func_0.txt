This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the first line specifies the number of pairs, and then for each pair, it checks if the numbers meet certain conditions and prints 'YES' if they do and 'NO' if they don't. The conditions for printing 'YES' are that either both numbers are even or one is twice the other and the other is odd. After processing all pairs, the function leaves the standard input empty.
