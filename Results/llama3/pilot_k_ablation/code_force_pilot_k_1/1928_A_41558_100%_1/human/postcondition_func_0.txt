This function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then determines whether it is possible to divide the rectangle into two equal halves with integer dimensions, printing 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.
