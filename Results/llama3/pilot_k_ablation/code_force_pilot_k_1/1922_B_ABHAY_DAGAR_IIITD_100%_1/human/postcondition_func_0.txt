Reads input from stdin, processes it in blocks of 2 lines, calculates the sum of indices of the first occurrence of each duplicate element in the second line of each block, and prints these sums. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the calculated sums to the console. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with the first line containing an integer t, followed by t blocks of 2 lines, where the first line of each block contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes this input, calculates the desired sums, and prints them to the console, leaving the input stream empty.
