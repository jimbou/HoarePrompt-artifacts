This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a non-negative integer and a list of non-negative integers. It then calculates the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in the list for each test case and prints the results. If there are no test cases, it does not perform any calculations and does not print anything.
