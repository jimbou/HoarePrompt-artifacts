Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for pairs of sticks with the same length, and then adds the number of previous sticks with the same length to the answer. However, this approach does not consider the case where three sticks with different lengths can form a triangle.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will output 0, because it only checks for pairs of sticks with the same length. However, the sticks with lengths 1, 2, and 3 can form a triangle, so the correct output should be at least 1.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they can form a triangle. This can be done by using a combination of sorting and checking the triangle inequality for each combination.
