Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers the case where two sticks have the same length, and the third stick is shorter. However, it does not consider the case where all three sticks have different lengths.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3], the program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, because we can choose the sticks with lengths 2, 4, and 8 to form a triangle.

The program needs to be modified to consider all possible cases, including the case where all three sticks have different lengths.
