Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program reads the input from stdin, processes it in blocks of 2 lines, and calculates the sum of indices of the first occurrence of each duplicate element in the second line of each block.

The program uses a dictionary (hashing) to keep track of the indices of the first occurrence of each element in the sorted array a. It then iterates through the array, and for each element, it adds the index of its first occurrence to the answer if the element is a duplicate.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The execution summary also confirms that the program processes the input correctly and prints the calculated sums to the console.

Correctness: **True**
