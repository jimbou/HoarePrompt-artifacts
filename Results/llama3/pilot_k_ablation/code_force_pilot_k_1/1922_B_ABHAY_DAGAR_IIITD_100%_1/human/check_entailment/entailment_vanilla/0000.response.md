Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program uses a hash map to store the frequency of each stick length and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t), the number of sticks (n), and the lengths of the sticks (a).
2. For each test case, the program initializes an empty hash map (hashing) to store the frequency of each stick length.
3. The program sorts the stick lengths in ascending order.
4. The program iterates through the sorted stick lengths. For each stick length, it checks if it is already present in the hash map. If not, it adds the stick length to the hash map with a frequency of 0.
5. The program increments the frequency of the current stick length in the hash map by the index of the current stick length. This is because the index represents the number of sticks with lengths less than the current stick length.
6. If the current stick length is the same as the next stick length, the program adds the frequency of the current stick length to the answer (ans). This is because the current stick length can be used to form a triangle with the next stick length and any stick length that is less than the current stick length.
7. The program repeats steps 4-6 until it has processed all the stick lengths.
8. The program appends the answer (ans) to the results list.
9. After processing all the test cases, the program prints the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
