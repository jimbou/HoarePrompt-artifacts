Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `data` contains `t+2t` lines from the original `stdin`, `current_index` is `t*(n+1)+1`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing the sum of the indices of the first occurrence of each duplicate element in `a` for each iteration of the loop, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `t` in `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary. If `t` is 0, then `results` is an empty list and `current_index` is 1.**
