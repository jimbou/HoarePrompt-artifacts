According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is 1. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `results` is not empty.
State: **`stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings, `current_index` is `t` times the value of `data[1]` plus 1, `t` is 0, `results` is not empty, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]`, `ans` is the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a` for the last iteration of the loop, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]` for the last iteration of the loop**
