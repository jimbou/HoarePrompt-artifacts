To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which is the variable `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. 

State: **`stdin` is empty, `data` contains `t+2t` lines from the original `stdin`, `current_index` is `t*(n+1)+1`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `t` in `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary. If `t` is 0, then `results` is an empty list and `current_index` is 1.**
