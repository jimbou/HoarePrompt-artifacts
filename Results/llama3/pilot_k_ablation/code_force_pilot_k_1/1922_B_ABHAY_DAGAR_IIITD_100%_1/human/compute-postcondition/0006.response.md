The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` is a list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, sorting `a` will rearrange these integer values in ascending order. The second line initializes a variable `ans` to 0.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, in ascending order.
- `ans` is 0.
- `current_index` remains `n+2`, as it is not modified by the code.
- `data` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it.
- `t` remains a positive integer, as it is not modified by the code.
- `results` remains an empty list, as it is not modified by the code.
- `hashing` remains an empty dictionary, as it is not modified by the code.
- `n` remains an integer equal to the value of `data[1]`, as it is not modified by the code.
- `stdin` remains empty, as it is not modified by the code.

Output State: **a is a sorted list containing the integer values of data[2] to data[n+1], current_index is n+2, data is a list of strings where data[1] is at least 0, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of data[1], ans is 0, stdin is empty**
