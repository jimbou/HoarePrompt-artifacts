To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already given as an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` is indeed at least 1.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means it's not used in the loop body. Therefore, we don't need to adjust its state.

The other variables in the state, `stdin`, `data`, `current_index`, and `results`, are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`stdin` is empty, `data` contains t+2t lines from the original stdin, `current_index` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
