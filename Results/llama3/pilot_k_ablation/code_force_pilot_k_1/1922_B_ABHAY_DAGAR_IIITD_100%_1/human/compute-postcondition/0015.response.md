Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers from `data` starting from index 2, `ans` is the sum of the indices of the first occurrence of each duplicate element in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `data` contains `t+2t` lines from the original `stdin`, `current_index` is `n+2`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index 1 in `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the index of the first occurrence of that element in `a`. If `n` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**
