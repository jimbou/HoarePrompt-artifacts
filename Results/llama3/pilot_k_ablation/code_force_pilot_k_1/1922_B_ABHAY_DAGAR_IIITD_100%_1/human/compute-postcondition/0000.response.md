Output State: **stdin is empty, data contains t+2t lines from the original stdin, current_index is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list**.

Explanation:
The code reads the entire contents of stdin into the `data` variable, which now contains `t+2t` lines from the original stdin. The `current_index` variable is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1 after reading the first line, which contains the integer `t`. The value of `t` is extracted from the first line and stored in the `t` variable. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. Stdin is now empty since its contents have been read into the `data` variable.
