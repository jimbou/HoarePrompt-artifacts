Output State: **stdin is empty, data is a list of strings, current_index is 1, t is a non-negative integer, results is an empty list**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the standard input (stdin) is empty because the input() function has read all the data from it. The data variable now holds a list of strings, which are the test cases read from stdin. The current_index variable has been incremented to 1, indicating that the first test case has been processed. The t variable holds a non-negative integer value, which is the first integer of the first test case. The results variable is an empty list, ready to store the results of the test cases.
