The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is 2, this means that the integer value of `data[2]` is added to `a`. The second line increments `current_index` by 1, making it 3.

Output State: **a is a list containing the integer value of data[2], current_index is 3, data is a list of strings where data[1] is at least 1, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of data[1] which is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty**
