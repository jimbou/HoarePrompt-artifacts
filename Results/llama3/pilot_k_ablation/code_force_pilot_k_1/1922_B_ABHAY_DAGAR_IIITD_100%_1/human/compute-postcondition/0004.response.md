Output State: **data contains t+2t lines from the original stdin, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list, _ is 0, hashing is an empty dictionary, n must be greater than 0, a contains one integer from data at index 2, current_index is 3, i is 0, stdin is empty**

The code appends an integer from data at index 2 to list a and increments current_index by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
