To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute at least once. Since `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]`, we need to adjust the state of `data[1]` to be at least 2.

State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of data[2] to data[n+1], `current_index` is n+2, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]` which is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
