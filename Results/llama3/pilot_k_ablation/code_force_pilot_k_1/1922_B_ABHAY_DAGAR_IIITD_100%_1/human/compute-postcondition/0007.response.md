To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of n integers from data starting from index 2, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `data` contains t+2t lines from the original stdin, `current_index` is n+2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index 1 in data and is at least 2, `i` is 0**
