To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`stdin` is empty, `data` contains t+2t lines from the original stdin, `current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
