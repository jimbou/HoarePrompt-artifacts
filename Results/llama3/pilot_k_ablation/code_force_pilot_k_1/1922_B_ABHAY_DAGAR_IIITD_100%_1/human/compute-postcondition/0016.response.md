Output State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `current_index` is `n+2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is at least 0, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element of `a` and its value is the sum of all indices of that element in `a`, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]`, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `hashing` is an empty dictionary and `ans` is 0.**

The code appends the value of `ans` to the `results` list. The value of `ans` is the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a`.
