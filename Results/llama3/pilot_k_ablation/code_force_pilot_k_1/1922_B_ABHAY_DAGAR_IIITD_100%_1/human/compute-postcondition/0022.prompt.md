You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers is a list of non-negative integers. The length of the list is equal to the first integer. The integers in the list are in the range 0 to the first integer.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is 1.

Return Postconditions: `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings, `current_index` is `t` times the value of `data[1]` plus 1, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a` for each iteration of the loop, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]`, `ans` is the sum of the indices of all consecutive equal elements in `a` for the last iteration of the loop, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]` for the last iteration of the loop, and all elements in `results` have been printed. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute and `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `current_index` is 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
