Output State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `current_index` is `n+2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]` which is at least 2, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with `a[0]` as a key and 0 as its value if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, otherwise `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`, which is the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, `current_index` is still `n+2`, `data` is still a list of strings with `data[1]` being at least 2, `t` is still a positive integer, `results` is still an empty list, `n` is still an integer equal to the value of `data[1]` which is at least 2, `stdin` is still empty, `i` is still 0, and `hashing` is still a dictionary with `a[0]` as a key and 0 as its value if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, otherwise `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`. The current value of `a[i]` is still equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.
