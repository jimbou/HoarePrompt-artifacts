Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers from `data` starting from index 2, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `data` contains `t+2t` lines from the original `stdin`, `current_index` is `n+2`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index 1 in `data` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to `hashing[a[0]]` which is 0.***
