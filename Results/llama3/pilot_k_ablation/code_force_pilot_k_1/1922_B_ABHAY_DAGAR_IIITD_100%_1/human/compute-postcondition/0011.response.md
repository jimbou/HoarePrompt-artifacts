Output State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `current_index` is `n+2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[1]` which is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with `a[0]` as a key and 0 as its value if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, otherwise `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashing[a[i]]` has been updated. If `a[i]` was not already a key in the `hashing` dictionary, it has been added with a value of `i`. If `a[i]` was already a key in the `hashing` dictionary, its value has been incremented by `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
