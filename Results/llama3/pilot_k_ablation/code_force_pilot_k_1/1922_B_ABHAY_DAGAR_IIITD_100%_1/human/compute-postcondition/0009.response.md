Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers from `data` starting from index 2, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `data` contains `t+2t` lines from the original `stdin`, `current_index` is `n+2`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the value of `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index 1 in `data` and is at least 2, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains sorted and unchanged, `ans` is still 0, there is no input in `stdin`, `data` still contains `t+2t` lines from the original `stdin`, the `current_index` is still `n+2`, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, `results` is still an empty list, `_` is still 0, but now `hashing` contains the value of `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0, `n` is still an integer equal to the value at index 1 in `data` and is at least 2, and `i` is still 0.
