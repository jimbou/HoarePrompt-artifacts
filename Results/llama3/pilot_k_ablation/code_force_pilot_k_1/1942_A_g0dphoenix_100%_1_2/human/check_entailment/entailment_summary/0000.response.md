Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  When `n` equals `k`, it prints a string of `n` '1's separated by spaces, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2.  When `k` equals 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
3.  For all other cases, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
