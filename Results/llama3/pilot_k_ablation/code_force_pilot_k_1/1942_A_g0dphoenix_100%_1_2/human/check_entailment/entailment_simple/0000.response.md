Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. If `n == k`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints a string of `n` '1's separated by spaces, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are indeed sorted.

2. If `k == 1`, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces. This is a valid solution because the cyclic shift that starts with the smallest number (1) is sorted, and all other cyclic shifts are not sorted.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that `k` is greater than 1 and less than `n`. In this case, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid solution. This is correct because it is impossible to construct an array with `n` elements such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, where `k` is greater than 1 and less than `n`.

Therefore, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
