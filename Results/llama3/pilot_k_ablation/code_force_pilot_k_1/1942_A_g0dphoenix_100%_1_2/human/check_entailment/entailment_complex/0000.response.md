Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts. The program handles three cases:

1.  When n equals k, it prints a string of n '1's separated by spaces. This is a correct solution because an array of all '1's has all its cyclic shifts sorted.

2.  When k equals 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces. This is also a correct solution because an array of consecutive numbers has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

3.  For all other cases, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array. This is correct because, according to the problem constraints, if k is greater than 1 and less than n, there is no array that can satisfy the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and k, and prints the corresponding output.

Correctness: **True**
