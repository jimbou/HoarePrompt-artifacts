Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and k.

If n is equal to k, it means that all cyclic shifts must be sorted, so the program prints an array of 1's of length n.

If k is 1, it means that only one cyclic shift must be sorted, so the program prints an array of consecutive integers from 1 to n.

If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions, so the program prints -1.

The program's logic is correct and it covers all possible cases. The use of list comprehension and the join function makes the code concise and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
