Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n > 2 and k = n - 1. In this case, the program prints -1, but there is a valid array a that satisfies the requirements. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the array a = [1, 2, 3] satisfies the requirements, but the program prints -1.

The program only handles the cases when n = k, k = 1, or k > 1 and n = 2. It does not handle the case when n > 2 and k = n - 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
