To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer `t` in the input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^3. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` is at least 1 and `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), _ is 0**
