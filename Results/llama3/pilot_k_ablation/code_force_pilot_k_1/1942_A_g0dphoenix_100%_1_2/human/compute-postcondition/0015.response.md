Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then prints a specific pattern of numbers based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, it prints a string of n '1's separated by spaces. If k equals 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces. For all other cases, it prints -1. The function continues to read and process test cases until the input is exhausted, at which point it terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
