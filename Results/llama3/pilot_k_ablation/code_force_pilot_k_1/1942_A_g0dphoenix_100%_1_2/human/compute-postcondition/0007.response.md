The code prints a string containing the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at the current value of `n`. The numbers are incremented by 1 because the list comprehension uses `x + 1` for each `x` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the current value of n, an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
