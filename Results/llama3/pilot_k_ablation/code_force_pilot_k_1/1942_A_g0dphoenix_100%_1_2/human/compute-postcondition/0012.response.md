Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to n is being printed, where each number is separated by a space. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.***
