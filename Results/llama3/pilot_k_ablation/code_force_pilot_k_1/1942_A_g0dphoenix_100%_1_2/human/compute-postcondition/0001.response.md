Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains t-1 lines of input, each with two integers n and k, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
