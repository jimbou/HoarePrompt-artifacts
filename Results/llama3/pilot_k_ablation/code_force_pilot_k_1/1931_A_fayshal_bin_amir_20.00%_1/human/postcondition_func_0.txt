This function takes an integer 'num' between 3 and 78 (inclusive) as input and returns a lowercase alphabet character that corresponds to the integer value of 'num' when 'num' is treated as an ASCII value, but only if 'num' is also between 1 and 26 (inclusive). If 'num' is outside this range (i.e., between 27 and 78), the function does not return any value.
