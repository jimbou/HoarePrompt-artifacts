Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, when the input is 4, the program will output "aaz", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "aab". 

The issue is that the program only checks if the input is less than or equal to 26, or if it is between 27 and 52, or if it is greater than 52. However, it does not consider the case where the input is between 3 and 26, where the first letter can be "a" and the second letter can be a letter other than "a". 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle this additional case.
