#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 <= num <= 78.
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase alphabet character corresponding to the current value of num, which is between 'a' (97) and 'z' (122), because num is an integer such that 3 <= num <= 78, and the current value of num is between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
    #State: *num is an integer such that 27 <= num <= 78

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer num as input and returns a lowercase alphabet character. If num is between 1 and 26 (inclusive), it returns the corresponding lowercase alphabet character. If num is between 27 and 78 (inclusive), the function does not perform any action and does not return a value.
