Output State: **The program returns a lowercase alphabet character that corresponds to the integer value of 'num' when 'num' is treated as an ASCII value, where 'num' is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive) and also between 1 and 26 (inclusive).**

In simpler terms, the program returns a lowercase alphabet character (a-z) that corresponds to the integer value of 'num' when 'num' is treated as an ASCII value. The ASCII values of lowercase alphabet characters range from 97 (for 'a') to 122 (for 'z'). The program adds 96 to 'num', which effectively converts 'num' to its corresponding ASCII value, and then returns the corresponding lowercase alphabet character.
