Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements equal to the median value in the corresponding test case.**
