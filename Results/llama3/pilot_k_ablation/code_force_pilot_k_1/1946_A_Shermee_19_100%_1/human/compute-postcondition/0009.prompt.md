You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list where each element is the number of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the median value for each test case, `case` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the length of the last list `a` and `n` is at least 2, `a` is the sorted list with at least 2 elements, `median_index` is the index of the first element in the sorted list `a` that is greater than the median value, `median_value` is the median value of the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the number of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the median value. If `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is an empty list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in the sorted list 'a' that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list 'results' is empty if 'test_cases' is an empty list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in the sorted list 'a' that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list 'results' is empty if 'test_cases' is an empty list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
