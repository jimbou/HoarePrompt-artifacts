Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers, `results` is an empty list**

In this output state, the code has created a new empty list called `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The `results` list is now an empty list, waiting to be populated with results from the test cases.
