Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `test_cases` remains unchanged, still containing a list of lists with a single integer n followed by a list of n integers. The code introduces a new variable `results`, which is initialized as an empty list.
