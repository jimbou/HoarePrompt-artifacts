Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the length of the list a and n is at least 2, a is the sorted list with at least 2 elements, median_index is the index of the median value in the sorted list a plus 1, median_value is the median value of the sorted list a, operations is 1**

The code increments the median_index by 1 and the operations by 1. The median_index is now the index of the median value in the sorted list a plus 1. The operations is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
