Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements equal to the median value in the corresponding test case. Each integer in the list corresponds to a test case in the `test_cases` list, and the median value is calculated from the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in each test case.**
