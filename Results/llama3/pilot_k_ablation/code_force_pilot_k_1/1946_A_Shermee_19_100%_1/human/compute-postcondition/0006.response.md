The code `results.append(operations)` adds the value of `operations` to the end of the list `results`. The value of `operations` is the number of elements equal to the median value in the list `a`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is the sorted list of numbers, `median_index` is the index of the first number greater than the median value in the sorted list `a`, `median_value` is the median value of the list `a`, `operations` is the number of elements equal to the median value, `test_cases` contains at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the number of elements equal to the median value.**
