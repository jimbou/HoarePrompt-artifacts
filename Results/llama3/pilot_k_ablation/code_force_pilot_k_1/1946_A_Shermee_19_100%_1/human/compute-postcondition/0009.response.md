Functionality: **This function calculates the number of elements equal to the median value in each test case. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains a list of integers, and returns a list of integers representing the count of median values in each test case. The function sorts the integers in each test case, finds the median value, and then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. The function returns a list of these counts, where each count corresponds to a test case in the input list.**
