To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `case` and the list `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. Since `results` is an empty list before the loop starts, it does not affect the loop's execution.

So, for the loop to be executed, the `test_cases` list must have at least 1 test case, and `case` is the first test case in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
