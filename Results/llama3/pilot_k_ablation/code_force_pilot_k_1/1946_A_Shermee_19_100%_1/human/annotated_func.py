    #State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list where each element is the number of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the median value for each test case, `case` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the length of the last list `a` and `n` is at least 2, `a` is the sorted list with at least 2 elements, `median_index` is the index of the first element in the sorted list `a` that is greater than the median value, `median_value` is the median value of the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the number of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the median value. If `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is an empty list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in the sorted list 'a' that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list 'results' is empty if 'test_cases' is an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of elements equal to the median value in each test case. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer 'n' and a list of 'n' integers. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of elements equal to the median value in the corresponding test case. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
