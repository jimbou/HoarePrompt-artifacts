    #State: `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements equal to the median value in the corresponding test case.

    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements equal to the median value in the corresponding test case. Each integer in the list corresponds to a test case in the `test_cases` list, and the median value is calculated from the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of elements equal to the median value in each test case. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains a list of integers, and returns a list of integers representing the count of median values in each test case. The function sorts the integers in each test case, finds the median value, and then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. The function returns a list of these counts, where each count corresponds to a test case in the input list.
