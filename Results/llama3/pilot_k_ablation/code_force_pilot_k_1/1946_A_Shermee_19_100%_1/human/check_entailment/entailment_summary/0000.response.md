Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
2. It then finds the median index, which is the index of the middle element in the sorted array. If the length of the array is even, the median index is the index of the lower middle element.
3. The program then finds the median value, which is the value at the median index.
4. It then counts the number of elements that are equal to the median value, starting from the median index and moving to the right. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program's logic is correct because increasing the median of the array requires increasing all elements that are equal to the current median value. By counting the number of such elements, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required.

Correctness: **True**
