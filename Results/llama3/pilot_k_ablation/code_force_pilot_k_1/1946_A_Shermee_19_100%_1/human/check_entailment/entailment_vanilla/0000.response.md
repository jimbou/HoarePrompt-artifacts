Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median of an array. The provided program sorts the array, finds the median index and value, and then counts the number of elements with the same value as the median. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. Sorting the array: The program correctly sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.

2. Finding the median index and value: The program correctly calculates the median index using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`, where `n` is the length of the array. It also correctly finds the median value by accessing the element at the median index.

3. Counting the number of elements with the same value as the median: The program correctly counts the number of elements with the same value as the median by iterating through the array starting from the median index and incrementing the count until it finds an element with a different value.

4. Returning the count as the minimum number of operations: The program correctly returns the count as the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Based on this analysis, the program is correct, and the output will match the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
