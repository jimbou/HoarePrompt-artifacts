Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
2. It then finds the median index and value. The median index is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, which is correct because the median of an array with an odd length is the middle element, and the median of an array with an even length is the average of the two middle elements.
3. The program then counts the number of elements that have the same value as the median. This is done by incrementing the `median_index` until it reaches an element with a different value or the end of the array. The number of increments is stored in the `operations` variable.
4. The program returns the `operations` value, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program correctly handles arrays with distinct and non-distinct numbers, as well as arrays with odd and even lengths. It also correctly calculates the median index and value, and counts the number of elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
