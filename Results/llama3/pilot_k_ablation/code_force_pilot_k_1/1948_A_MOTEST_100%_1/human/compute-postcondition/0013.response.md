The code prints the string `ans` which consists of the first `n/2` uppercase English letters, each repeated twice. Since `n` is an even integer, `n/2` is an integer. The string `ans` is constructed by repeating each of the first `n/2` uppercase English letters twice.

Output: **The string consisting of the first n/2 uppercase English letters each repeated twice (where n/2 is an integer and n is an even integer)**
