Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer specifies the number of subsequent integers to process. For each subsequent integer, if it is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of the first half of the uppercase English alphabet, with each letter repeated twice. If the integer is odd, the function prints 'NO'. The function processes all input integers and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
