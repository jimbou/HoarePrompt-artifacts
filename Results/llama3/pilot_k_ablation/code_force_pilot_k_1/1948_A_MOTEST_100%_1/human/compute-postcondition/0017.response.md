Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of subsequent integers to process. For each subsequent integer, if it is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of the first half of the uppercase English alphabet repeated twice. If the integer is odd, the function prints 'NO'. The function clears the console screen before processing the input and empties the standard input buffer after processing.**
