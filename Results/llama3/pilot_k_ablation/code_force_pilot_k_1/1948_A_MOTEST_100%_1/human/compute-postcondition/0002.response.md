Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input by the user, and stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the value of `n`. The values of `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
