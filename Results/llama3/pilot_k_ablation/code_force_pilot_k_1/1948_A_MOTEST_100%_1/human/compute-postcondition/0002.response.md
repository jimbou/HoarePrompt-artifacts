Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, the console screen has been cleared, stdin contains t-1 integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input by the user, and the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The string `s` remains unchanged, containing all uppercase English letters. The variable `i` is still 0. The console screen remains cleared. The stdin now contains t-1 integers, as one integer has been consumed by the `input()` function.
