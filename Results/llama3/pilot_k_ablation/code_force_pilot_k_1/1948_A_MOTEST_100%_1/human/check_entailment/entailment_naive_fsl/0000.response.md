Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it handles all the potential cases according to the problem description. 

The program first checks if the number of special characters `n` is odd. If it is, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to create a string with an odd number of special characters. 

If `n` is even, the program creates a string by repeating each uppercase Latin letter twice. This ensures that each character in the string has exactly one neighbor that is the same, making it a special character. The program then prints 'YES' and the created string.

The program handles all the potential cases correctly, including the edge case where `n` is odd. Therefore, the program is correct.
