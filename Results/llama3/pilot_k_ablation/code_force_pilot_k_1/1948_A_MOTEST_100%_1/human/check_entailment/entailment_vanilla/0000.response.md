Reasoning:

1. The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. The program starts by clearing the screen using `os.system('cls')`, which is unnecessary for the problem solution.

3. The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

4. For each test case, it reads the number of special characters `n`.

5. If `n` is odd, the program prints 'NO' because it's impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters.

6. If `n` is even, the program initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` to 0.

7. The program then enters a loop that runs `n // 2` times. In each iteration, it appends two occurrences of the `x`-th uppercase letter to `ans` and increments `x`.

8. After the loop, the program prints 'YES' and the constructed string `ans`.

9. The program uses the `string.ascii_uppercase` constant to get the string of all uppercase Latin letters.

10. The program correctly handles the case when `n` is odd by printing 'NO'.

11. The program correctly constructs the string for even `n` by appending pairs of the same letter.

12. The program does not exceed the maximum length of 200 characters for the constructed string.

Correctness: **True**
