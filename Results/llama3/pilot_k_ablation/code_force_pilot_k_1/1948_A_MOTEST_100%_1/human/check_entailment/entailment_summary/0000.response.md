Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases (t) from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer (n) and checks if it is even or odd.
3. If n is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters.
4. If n is even, it builds a string by repeating each letter of the alphabet twice, starting from 'A'. The length of the string is n // 2, which is the number of pairs of special characters.
5. It prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It processes all input integers, prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly, and terminates without any errors.

Correctness: **True**
