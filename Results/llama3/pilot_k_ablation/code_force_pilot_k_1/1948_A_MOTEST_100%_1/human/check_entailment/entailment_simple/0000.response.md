Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters. The program takes an integer n as input and checks if it is even or odd. If n is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to build a string with an odd number of special characters. If n is even, it builds a string by repeating each of the first n/2 uppercase English letters twice and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly handles the cases where n is odd and even. When n is odd, it is indeed impossible to build a string with exactly n special characters, so printing 'NO' is the correct response. When n is even, the program constructs a string with exactly n special characters by repeating each of the first n/2 uppercase English letters twice, which is a valid solution.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
