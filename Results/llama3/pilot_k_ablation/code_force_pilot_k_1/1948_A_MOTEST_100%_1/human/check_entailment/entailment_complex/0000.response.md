Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer specifies the number of subsequent integers to process.

For each subsequent integer, the program checks if it is even. If it is even, the program prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of the first half of the uppercase English alphabet, with each letter repeated twice. This is a correct solution because each pair of repeated letters has exactly one special character (the second letter in each pair).

If the integer is odd, the program prints 'NO'. This is also correct because it is impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters, as each pair of repeated letters has exactly one special character.

The program processes all input integers and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.

Correctness: **True**
