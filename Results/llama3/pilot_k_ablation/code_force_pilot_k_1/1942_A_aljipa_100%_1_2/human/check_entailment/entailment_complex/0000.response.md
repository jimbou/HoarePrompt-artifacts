Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts. The program takes input from the user in the form of pairs of integers (n, k), where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the desired array. If k is equal to n, it generates an array of all 1s, which satisfies the condition of having all sorted cyclic shifts. If k is 1, it generates an array of numbers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift. For any other values of k, it generates an array of all -1s, indicating that no such array exists.

The program's logic is correct and efficient. It handles all possible cases of input values and generates the correct output for each case. The use of list comprehension and conditional expressions makes the code concise and readable.

Correctness: **True**
