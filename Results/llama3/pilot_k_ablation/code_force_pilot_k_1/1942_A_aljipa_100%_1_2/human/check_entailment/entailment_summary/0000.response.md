Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1. If k is equal to n, it generates a list of all 1s, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the list are sorted.

2. If k is 1, it generates a list of numbers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the list is sorted (the original list itself).

3. For any other values of k, it generates a list containing only -1, which indicates that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
