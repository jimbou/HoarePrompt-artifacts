Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers, n and k, representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts, respectively.

3. The program then uses a conditional expression to determine the output based on the values of n and k.

   - If k is equal to n, it means all cyclic shifts must be sorted. In this case, the program outputs an array of n ones, which satisfies the condition because all elements are equal and therefore sorted.

   - If k is equal to 1, it means only one cyclic shift must be sorted. In this case, the program outputs an array of numbers from 1 to n in ascending order. This array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself), which meets the requirement.

   - If k is neither equal to n nor 1, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

4. The program uses the `*` operator to unpack the list of numbers and print them separated by spaces.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
