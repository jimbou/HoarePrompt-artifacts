Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the number of sorted cyclic shifts `k`:

1. If `k` is equal to `n`, it means that all cyclic shifts must be sorted. In this case, the program outputs a list of all 1s, which satisfies the condition.

2. If `k` is equal to 1, it means that exactly one cyclic shift must be sorted. In this case, the program outputs a list of numbers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition.

3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the condition. In this case, the program outputs -1, which is the correct output according to the problem statement.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the correct result for each case.

Correctness: **True**
