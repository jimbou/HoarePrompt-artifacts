Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = n - 1. In this case, the program should output an array with n - 1 elements in increasing order and the last element being 1, but the program outputs [-1] instead.

For example, when n = 4 and k = 3, the program should output [1, 2, 3, 1] but it outputs [-1] instead.

The correct solution should handle the case when k = n - 1 separately and output the correct array.
