This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair consists of a number n and a number k. For each pair, it generates a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If k is equal to n, the list contains all 1s. If k is 1, the list contains a range of numbers from 1 to n. For any other values of k, the list contains all -1s. The function then prints each generated list.
