The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list.

Since `res` is a list of integers, the output will be a sequence of integers separated by spaces.

The exact values of the integers in the `res` list are not specified in the precondition, so we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `res` list.

Output: **elements of the res list (where res is a list of integers)**
