To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range function).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), we can adjust the state to `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
