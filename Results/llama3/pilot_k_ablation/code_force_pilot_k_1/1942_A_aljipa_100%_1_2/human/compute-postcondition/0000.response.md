Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin are still valid, consisting of t pairs of integers n and k, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3.
