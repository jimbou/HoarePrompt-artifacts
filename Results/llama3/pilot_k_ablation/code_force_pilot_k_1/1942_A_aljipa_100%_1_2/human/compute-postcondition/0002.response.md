The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The second line creates a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` is 1, `res` becomes a list of numbers from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing only -1.

Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers**
