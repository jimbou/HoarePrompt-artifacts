#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance` is 0, `positions` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the balance of parentheses at a specific position in the string, the position, and the character at that position. The balance in the last tuple is 0, indicating that the string is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string containing the characters from a non-empty string s, in the order of their corresponding balance and position, where s consists only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reorders a balanced parentheses sequence based on the balance and position of each character, returning a new string with the characters rearranged accordingly.
