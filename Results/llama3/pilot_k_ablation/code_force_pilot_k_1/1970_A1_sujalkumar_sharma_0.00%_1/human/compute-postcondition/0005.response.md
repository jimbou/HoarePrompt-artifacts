Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `char` is ')', `n` is the length of s, `balance` is -1, `positions` is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been updated to -1, as it was initially 0 and the code decremented it by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, as their values were not affected by the code.
