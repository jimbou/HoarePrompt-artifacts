According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, balance is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and the i is 0 and char is the first character in the string s.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `balance` is 0, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `s`**
