To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `char`, and `s`.

Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, we know that `s` has at least one character. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `s` to "s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character".

The variable `i` is an index, and since `s` has at least one character, we can adjust the state of `i` to "i is 0", which is the starting index of the string.

The variable `char` is the character at the current index `i` in the string `s`. Since `s` has at least one character, we can adjust the state of `char` to "char is the first character in the string s".

The other variables `n`, `balance`, and `positions` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string s, `n` is the length of s, `balance` is 0, `positions` is an empty list**
