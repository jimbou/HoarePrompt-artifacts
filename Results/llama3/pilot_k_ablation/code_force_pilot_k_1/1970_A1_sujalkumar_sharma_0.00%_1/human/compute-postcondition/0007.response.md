Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing one tuple, where the first element is either 1 if the first character in the string `s` is "(" or -1 if the first character in the string `s` is ")", the second element is 0, and the third element is the first character of the string `s`, `i` is 0, `balance` is either 1 if the first character in the string `s` is "(" or -1 if the first character in the string `s` is ")"**

In this output state, the `positions` list now contains a single tuple, which includes the balance value (either 1 or -1), the index `i` (which is 0), and the first character of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
