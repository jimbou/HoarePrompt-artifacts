Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of s, `positions` is a list containing one tuple: (1, 0, '(') if the first character in the string `s` is '(', otherwise ( -1, 0, ')'), `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string `s` is '(', otherwise -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains unchanged, the index `i` is still 0, the length of the string `s` is still `n`, and the list `positions` now contains a tuple with the balance, index, and character of the first character in the string `s`. The balance is 1 if the first character is '(', otherwise it's -1.
