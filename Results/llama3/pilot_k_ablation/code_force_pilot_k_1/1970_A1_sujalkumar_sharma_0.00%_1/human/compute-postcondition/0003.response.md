Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string s and equals to '(', `n` is the length of s, `balance` is 1, `positions` is an empty list**

The code increments the value of `balance` by 1. The initial value of `balance` is 0, so after the increment, `balance` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character. The value of `i` is still 0, and `char` is still the first character in the string `s`, which is '('. The length of `s` is still `n`, and `positions` is still an empty list.
