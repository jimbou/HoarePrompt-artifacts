Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `balance` is 1, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `char` is "("**

The code increments the value of `balance` by 1. The initial value of `balance` was 0, so after the increment, `balance` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
