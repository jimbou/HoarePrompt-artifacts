stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a string s of length n. The integer t is a positive integer not greater than 10^4. The integer n is a positive integer not greater than 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The string s consists of lowercase Latin letters.
