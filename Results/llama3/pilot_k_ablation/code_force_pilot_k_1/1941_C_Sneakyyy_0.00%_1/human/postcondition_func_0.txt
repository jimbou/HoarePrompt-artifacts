This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. It counts and prints the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each string, considering only substrings of length 3. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and does not return any value.
