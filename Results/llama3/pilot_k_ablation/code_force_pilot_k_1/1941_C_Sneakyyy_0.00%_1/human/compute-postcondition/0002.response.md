According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `a` is a string equal to the first test case. `a` being a string equal to the first test case does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a string with at least 3 characters. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string with at least 3 characters, ans is 0, i is 0**
