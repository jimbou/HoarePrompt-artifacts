Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string of lowercase Latin letters. It then counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each test case and prints this count. The function processes all test cases and prints the count for each case. After execution, the function leaves the standard input empty and stores the last test case and its corresponding count in the variables 'a' and 'ans', respectively.**
