Output State: **stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^4), ans is 1, i is 3, the current value of s is either 'map' or 'pie', and the string s of length 3 from a starting at index i is being printed.**

Explanation: The first line increments the value of `i` by 3, making it 3. The second line increments the value of `ans` by 1, making it 1. The value of `a` remains unchanged, as does the value of `s`. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1, leaving `t-2` test cases.
