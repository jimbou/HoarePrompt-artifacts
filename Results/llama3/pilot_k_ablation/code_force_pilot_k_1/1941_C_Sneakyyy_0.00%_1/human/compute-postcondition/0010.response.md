Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-2 test cases if the string s is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^4), ans is 1 if s is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise ans is 0, i is 3 if s is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 1, and the string s of length 3 from a starting at index i is being printed.***
