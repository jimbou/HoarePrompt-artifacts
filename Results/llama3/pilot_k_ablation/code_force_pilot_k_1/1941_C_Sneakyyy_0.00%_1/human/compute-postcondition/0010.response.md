Postcondition: ***`a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 1 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 is being printed. If the substring `s` of `a` from index 0 to 2 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
