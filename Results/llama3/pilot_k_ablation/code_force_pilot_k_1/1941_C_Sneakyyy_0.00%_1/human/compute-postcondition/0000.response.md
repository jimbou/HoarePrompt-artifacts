To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its state isn't crucial for the loop's execution. However, the expression `int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state that `stdin` contains `t` test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer not greater than 10^4 for the loop to execute. The states of `n` and `s` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution, as they are inputs within the loop body, not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`stdin` contains `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer not greater than 10^4**
