Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^6) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `a` is an integer (1 <= `a` <= 10^4), `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3 from `a` starting at index `i`, and the string `s` of length 3 from `a` starting at index `i` is being printed. The string `s` is not equal to 'map' and not equal to 'pie'***
