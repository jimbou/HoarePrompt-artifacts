Output State: **`a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` from index 0 to 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2, which means it is the first three characters of the string `a`. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
