Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^6) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `a` is an integer (1 <= `a` <= 10^4), `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3 from `a` starting at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `i` are still the same as in the initial state.
