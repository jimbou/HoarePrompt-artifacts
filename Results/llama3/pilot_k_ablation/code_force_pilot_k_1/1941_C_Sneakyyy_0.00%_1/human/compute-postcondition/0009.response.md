Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^6) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `a` is an integer (1 <= `a` <= 10^4), `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length 3 from `a` starting at index `i`, and the string `s` of length 3 from `a` starting at index `i` is being printed. The string `s` is not equal to 'map' and not equal to 'pie'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s`. The value of `a` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `ans` is still 0. The string `s` is still being printed, and it is still not equal to 'map' or 'pie'.
