Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string equal to the first test case, ans is 0, i is 0**

The first line reads the first test case from stdin and assigns it to the variable `a`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The third line initializes the variable `i` to 0. No other variables are affected.
