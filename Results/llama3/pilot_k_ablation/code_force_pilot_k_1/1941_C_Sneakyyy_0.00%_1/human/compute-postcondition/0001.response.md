Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^4), ans is 0, i is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since `a` is an integer greater than 0, `a` becomes an integer between 1 and 10^4. The second line initializes `ans` to 0. The third line initializes `i` to 0. No other variables are affected.
