Reasoning:

The given program is designed to count the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each test case string, considering only substrings of length 3. However, the problem statement requires the program to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, not just count the occurrences of the substrings.

The program's logic is incorrect because it increments the counter 'ans' by 1 whenever it finds a substring 'map' or 'pie', but it does not consider the fact that deleting one character can make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mmap", deleting one 'm' makes the string beautiful, but the program would count it as 2 occurrences of 'map'.

Moreover, the program only checks substrings of length 3, but the problem statement does not restrict the length of the substrings. The program should check for substrings of any length that contain 'map' or 'pie'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
