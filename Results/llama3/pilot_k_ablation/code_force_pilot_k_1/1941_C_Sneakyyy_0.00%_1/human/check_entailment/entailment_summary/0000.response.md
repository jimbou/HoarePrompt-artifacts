Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program increments the index `i` by 1 when it encounters a substring that is not 'map' or 'pie', which means it will miss some occurrences of these substrings. For example, if the string is "mapmap", the program will only count one occurrence of 'map' because it increments `i` by 1 after finding the first 'map', and then it will not check the next two characters again.

Correctness: **False**
