Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program iterates over the string, checking for the substrings 'map' and 'pie', and increments the count whenever it finds one. The count is then printed as the output.

The program also handles the edge case where the string is already beautiful by not incrementing the count in such cases.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
