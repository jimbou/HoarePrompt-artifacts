Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "mapmap", the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. This is because the program is counting the number of occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, but it's not considering the case where "map" and "pie" overlap.

In the given program, the while loop is incrementing the index `i` by 3 when it finds "map" or "pie", but it's not checking if the next character is also part of another "map" or "pie". This can lead to incorrect counting.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". One possible solution is to use a sliding window approach, where the program checks for "map" and "pie" in a window of 3 characters, and then moves the window one character at a time.
