Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and return 2, but the correct answer should be 1 because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

In the given program, the variable `i` is incremented by 3 when a substring "map" or "pie" is found, but this can lead to skipping over some characters in the string. A correct approach would be to increment `i` by 1 in all cases, and use a separate variable to keep track of the minimum number of characters that need to be removed.

Here is an example of a correct program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                ans += 1
            i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This program correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful, even in cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie".
