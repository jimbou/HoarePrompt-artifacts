According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one and t is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0**
