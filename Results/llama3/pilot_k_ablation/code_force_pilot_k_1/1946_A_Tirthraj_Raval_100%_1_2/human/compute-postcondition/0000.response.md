Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, t is an integer**.

The first line of the code reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two inputs (an integer and a list of integers), reading one integer will reduce the number of test cases in stdin by one. The value of `t` will be the integer read from stdin, which is the length of the array `a` in the first test case.
