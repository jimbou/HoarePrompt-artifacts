Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of the array) followed by a list of integers.
2.  It sorts each array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
3.  The program correctly calculates the index of the median value using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This formula works for both even and odd lengths of arrays.
4.  It counts the number of occurrences of the median value in the sorted array using the `count` method. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array, because increasing any of these median values will increase the median of the array.
5.  Finally, the program prints the count of median value occurrences for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **True**
