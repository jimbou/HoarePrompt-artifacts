Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the `sort()` method.
2. It then calculates the index `p` of the median element using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This formula correctly calculates the index of the median element for both even and odd-length arrays.
3. The program then counts the number of elements in the sorted array that are equal to the median element using the `count()` method. This count represents the number of elements that need to be increased by 1 to increase the median.
4. Finally, the program prints the count as the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Arrays with distinct elements
* Arrays with duplicate elements
* Arrays with an even or odd number of elements
* Arrays with a single element

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
