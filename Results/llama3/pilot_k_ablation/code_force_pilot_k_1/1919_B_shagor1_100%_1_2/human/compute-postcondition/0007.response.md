The code prints the absolute difference between the total number of characters `n` and twice the number of "-" characters `neg` in the string `s`, unless `n` is equal to `neg`, in which case it prints `n`. 
Output: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `neg` is the number of "-" characters in `s`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the absolute difference between `n` and twice the number of "-" characters `neg` in the string `s` unless `n` is equal to `neg`, in which case `n` is printed**
