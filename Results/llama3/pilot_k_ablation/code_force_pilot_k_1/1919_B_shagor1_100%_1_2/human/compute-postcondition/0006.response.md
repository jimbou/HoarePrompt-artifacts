The code prints the absolute difference between the length of the string `s` and twice the number of "-" characters in `s`, unless the length of `s` is equal to the number of "-" characters, in which case it prints the length of `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and objects involved:

*   `n`: The length of the string `s`, which is an integer.
*   `s`: A string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters.
*   `neg`: The number of "-" characters in the string `s`.

The expression `abs(n - 2 * neg)` calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string `s` and twice the number of "-" characters in `s`. If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that all characters in the string `s` are "-", so the expression `n` is printed instead.

Output: **The absolute difference between the length of string s and twice the number of "-" characters in s, or the length of string s if all characters are "-"**
