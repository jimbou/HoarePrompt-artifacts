The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The value of `neg` was 0, so the value of `neg` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The first character of `s` is still `-` and `n` is still an integer greater than 0. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, the first character of `s` is `-`, `neg` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
