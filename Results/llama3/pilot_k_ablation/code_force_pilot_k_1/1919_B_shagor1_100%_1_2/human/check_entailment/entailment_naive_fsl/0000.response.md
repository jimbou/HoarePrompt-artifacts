Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for a given string of '+' and '-' characters. The program works by counting the number of '-' characters in the string and then calculating the absolute difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of '-' characters. This is because the penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is determined by the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the string consists only of '+' characters, only of '-' characters, or a mix of both. The program also handles the case where the string has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, in which case the penalty is equal to the length of the string.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
