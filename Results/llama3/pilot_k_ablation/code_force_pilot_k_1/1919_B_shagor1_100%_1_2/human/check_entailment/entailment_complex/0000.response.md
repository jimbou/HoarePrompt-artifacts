Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program works by counting the number of "-" characters in the input string, which corresponds to the number of -1 values in the array. It then calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of "-" characters. This is equivalent to calculating the absolute value of the sum of the array, since each "+" character corresponds to a value of 1 and each "-" character corresponds to a value of -1.

The program then prints this value, unless all characters in the string are "-", in which case it prints the length of the string. This is because if all characters are "-", the array consists entirely of -1 values, and the minimum penalty is achieved by not splitting the array at all.

The program's approach is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that the optimal way to split the array is to split it into subarrays that have a sum of 0, if possible. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so a subarray with a sum of 0 has a penalty of 0.

If it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of 0, the program calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of "-" characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
