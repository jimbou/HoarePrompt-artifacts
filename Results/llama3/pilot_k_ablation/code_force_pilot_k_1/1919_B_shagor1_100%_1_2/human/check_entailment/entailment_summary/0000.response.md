Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The key insight is that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program counts the number of "-" characters in the string, which represents the number of -1's in the array. It then calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of "-" characters, which gives the minimum possible penalty.

The program also handles the edge case where all characters are "-", in which case the penalty is simply the length of the string.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
