The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the frequency of elements in the list `arrC` and the value of `k`.

If any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. This means that the print statement will output the value of `k-1`.

On the other hand, if no element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `n`. This means that the print statement will output the value of `n`.

Since the exact values of `k` and the frequencies of elements in `arrC` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `k-1` or `n`.

Output: **k-1 (if any element in arrC has a frequency greater than or equal to k), otherwise n**
