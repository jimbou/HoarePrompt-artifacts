Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, followed by n integers. It then counts the frequency of each integer and prints k-1 if any integer appears at least k times, otherwise it prints n. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point stdin is empty and the function terminates.**
