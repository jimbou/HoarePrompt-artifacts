Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the current value of `i` and its value is either increased by 1 if `i` was already a key in `hashmap`, or 1 if `i` was not a key in `hashmap`, and the current value of `i` is the first element in `arrC` and is also a key in `hashmap`. If the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.***
