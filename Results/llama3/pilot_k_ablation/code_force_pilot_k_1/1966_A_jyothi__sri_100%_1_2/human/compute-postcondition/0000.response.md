The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the stdin, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. The value of `t` is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`.**
