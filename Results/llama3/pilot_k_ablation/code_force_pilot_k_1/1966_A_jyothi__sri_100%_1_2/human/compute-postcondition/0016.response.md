Output State: **`t` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case, `arrC` is the list of integers from the last test case, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the last test case and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in the last test case, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in the last test case has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`.**
