Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the current value of `i` and its value is increased by 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and the current value of `i` is the first element in `arrC` and is also a key in `hashmap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `hashmap[i]` is increased by 1, while the values of other variables remain the same. The dictionary `hashmap` still contains at least one key-value pair, where the key is the current value of `i` and its value is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
