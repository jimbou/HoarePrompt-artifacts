To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arrC`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arrC`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `ans` is equal to `n`, which is the length of `arrC`, we can infer that `arrC` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `arrC` to have at least 1 element, and the state of `i` to be the first element in `arrC`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, `i` is the first element in `arrC`**
