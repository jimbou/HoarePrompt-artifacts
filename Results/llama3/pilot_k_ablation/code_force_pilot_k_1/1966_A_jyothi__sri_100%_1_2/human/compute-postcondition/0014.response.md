Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arrC` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`, and the value of `ans` is being printed which is either `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `n`.**
