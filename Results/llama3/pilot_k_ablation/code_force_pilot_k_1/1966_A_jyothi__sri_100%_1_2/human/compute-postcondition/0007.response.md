Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with the first element of `arrC` as a key and 1 as its value, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in `arrC`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, between 1 and 500. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-1`. The values of `n` and `k` are unchanged. The list `arrC` still contains `n` integers with at least one element. The dictionary `hashmap` now contains the first element of `arrC` as a key with a value of 1. The value of `ans` is still equal to `n`. The value of `i` is still the first element in `arrC`.
