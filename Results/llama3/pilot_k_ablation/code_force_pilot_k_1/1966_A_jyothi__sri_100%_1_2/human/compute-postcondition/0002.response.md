Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, k is an integer, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n.**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, extracting two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `arrC`. It then initializes an empty dictionary `hashmap` and sets the value of `ans` to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, but since one test case has been read, there are now `t-1` test cases remaining in stdin.
