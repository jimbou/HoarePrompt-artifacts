Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations. The issue lies in the line `ans = k - 1`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the remaining cards that are not part of the k cards that can be exchanged.

For example, consider the input `n = 7, k = 2` and the card numbers `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`. The program will output `1` because it finds a pair of cards with the same number (`2`), but it does not consider the remaining 5 cards, which cannot be exchanged. The correct output should be `5` (the 5 remaining cards plus the 1 card that is left after exchanging the pair of `2`s).

The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.
