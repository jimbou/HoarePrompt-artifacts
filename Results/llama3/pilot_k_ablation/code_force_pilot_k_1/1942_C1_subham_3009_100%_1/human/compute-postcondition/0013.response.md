Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the list that have a difference of 2 and prints this value for each test case. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
