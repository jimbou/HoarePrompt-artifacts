The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the sorted list `arr` that have a difference of 2.
Since `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `ans` is the count of pairs with a difference of 2, the output will be the count of such pairs in the list `arr`.
Output: **the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the list arr that have a difference of 2**
