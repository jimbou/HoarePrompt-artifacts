Postcondition: ***The program processes multiple test cases from stdin. For each test case, it reads three integers n, x, and y, and x distinct integers from 1 to n. The program then calculates the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 in each test case plus x - 2 for each test case, and outputs this sum. If the program is not run as the main module, it does not process any test cases.***
