Postcondition: **The program has processed all test cases from stdin. For each test case, it has read three integers n, x, and y, and a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. The program has calculated the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the list that have a difference of 2 for the last test case, and stored this value in the variable ans. If there are no test cases (i.e., t is 0), stdin is empty.**
