Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The rest of the input in stdin remains the same, consisting of t test cases, each with two lines as described.
