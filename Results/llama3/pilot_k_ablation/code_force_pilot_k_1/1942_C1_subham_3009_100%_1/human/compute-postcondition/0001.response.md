Output State: **The program is running as the main module, `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program is still running as the main module. The variable `t` has been assigned a positive integer value, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases in stdin still consist of two lines each, with the first line containing three integers (n, x, and y) and the second line containing x distinct integers from 1 to n.
