Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the first test case has been read from stdin. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned from the first line of the test case. The list `arr` has been created from the second line of the test case, sorted in ascending order, and an additional element `n + arr[0]` has been appended to it. The variable `ans` has been initialized to `x - 2`.
