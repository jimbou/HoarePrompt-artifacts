Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is increased by 1, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still sorted and contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is still 2.
