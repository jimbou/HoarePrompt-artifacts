Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n + arr[0]` appended at the end, `ans` is `x - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 1, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in `arr` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1, and the properties of `arr` and the difference between its elements remain the same.
