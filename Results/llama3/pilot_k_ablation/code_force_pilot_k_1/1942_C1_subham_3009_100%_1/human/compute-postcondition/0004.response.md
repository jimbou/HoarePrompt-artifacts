The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If x is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), so it is already greater than 0. However, for the loop to execute, i must be 1. 
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + arr[0] appended at the end, ans is x - 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 1**
