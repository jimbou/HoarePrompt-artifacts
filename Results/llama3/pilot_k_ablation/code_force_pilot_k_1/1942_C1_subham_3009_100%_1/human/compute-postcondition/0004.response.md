To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `x` (inclusive), we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 1 and `x` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is an integer, `i` is 1**
