Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The program first reads the input, sorts the chosen vertices, and then checks for pairs of consecutive vertices that have a difference of 2. For each such pair, it increments the answer by 1. The program also handles the case where the first and last vertices are consecutive by appending n + arr[0] to the array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The execution summary also confirms that the program processes all test cases and empties the standard input.

Correctness: **True**
