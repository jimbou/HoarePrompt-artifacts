Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array of chosen vertices in ascending order. This is necessary to correctly calculate the number of triangular pieces.

2. The program then appends `n + arr[0]` to the array, where `n` is the number of sides of the polygon and `arr[0]` is the first chosen vertex. This is done to handle the case where the last chosen vertex is connected to the first chosen vertex, effectively wrapping around the polygon.

3. The program initializes the answer `ans` to `x - 2`, where `x` is the number of chosen vertices. This is because with `x` vertices, we can form at least `x - 2` triangles.

4. The program then iterates over the array of chosen vertices, starting from the second vertex (index 1). For each vertex, it checks if the difference between the current vertex and the previous vertex is 2. If it is, it increments the answer `ans` by 1. This is because if the difference is 2, it means we can form an additional triangle with the current vertex and the previous vertex.

5. Finally, the program prints the answer `ans`, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of chosen vertices is 2 or 3, and where the last chosen vertex is connected to the first chosen vertex. Therefore, the program is correct.
