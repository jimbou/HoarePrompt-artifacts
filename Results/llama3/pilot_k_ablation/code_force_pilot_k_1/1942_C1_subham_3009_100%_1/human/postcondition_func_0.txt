This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, x, and y) and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then calculates the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 in the sorted list plus x - 2, and outputs this sum. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
