This function reads a specified number of integers from standard input, calculates the product of the quotient and divisor minus one for each integer (if it is divisible by any number between 2 and itself), and prints the calculated values separated by newline characters. If an integer is not divisible by any number between 2 and itself, an empty element is printed. The function does not return any value.
