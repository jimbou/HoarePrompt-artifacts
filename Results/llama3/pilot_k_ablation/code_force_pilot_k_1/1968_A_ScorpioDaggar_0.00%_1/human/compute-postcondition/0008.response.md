Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000) where the first element is at least 2, `res` is a list containing one integer which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains empty, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.***
