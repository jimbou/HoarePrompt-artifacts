The `print(*res, sep='\n')` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, separated by newline characters.

Based on the precondition, the `res` list contains `num` integers, where each integer is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` for some `j` between 2 and `L1[i]` (inclusive). If `L1[i]` is not divisible by any `j` in this range, the corresponding element in `res` is an empty element.

Since the exact values of `L1` and `num` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of the `res` list, separated by newline characters.

Output: **the calculated values of the res list, separated by newline characters (where each value is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise an empty element)**
