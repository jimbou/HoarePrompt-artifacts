The code prints the elements of the list `res`, each on a new line, where each element in `res` is the product of the smallest divisor of the corresponding element in `L1` minus one and the corresponding element in `L1` divided by the smallest divisor.
Output: **the product of the smallest divisor of each element in L1 minus one and the corresponding element in L1 divided by the smallest divisor (where the elements are from the list res)**
