Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is a list containing `num` integers where each integer is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` for some `j` between 2 and `L1[i]` (inclusive), otherwise `res` contains `num` empty elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `num`.**
