The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `num`. Since stdin contains two inputs, the first input is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the second input is a series of integers representing the test cases. After this line executes, stdin will contain only the series of integers.

The second line initializes an empty list `L1`. This line does not affect any other variables.

The third line initializes an empty list `res`. Like the second line, this line does not affect any other variables.

After executing all three lines, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `num` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `L1` is an empty list.
- `res` is an empty list.
- Stdin contains a series of integers representing the test cases.

Output State: **num is an integer representing the number of test cases, L1 is an empty list, res is an empty list, stdin contains a series of integers representing the test cases.**
