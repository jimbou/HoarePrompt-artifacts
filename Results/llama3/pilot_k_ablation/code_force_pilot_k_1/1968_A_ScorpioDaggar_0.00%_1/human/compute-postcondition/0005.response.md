To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. The loop will execute if `L1[i]` is at least 2, because the range starts from 2. Since `i` is 0, we need to adjust the state of `L1` to ensure that the first element is at least 2.


State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000) where the first element is at least 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
