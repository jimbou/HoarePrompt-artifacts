To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `L1[i]`. If `L1[i]` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains a series of integers representing the test cases minus `num` integers, and `i` is 0.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains a series of integers representing the test cases minus `num` integers, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` must be at least 2, `j` is 2**
