To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` is at least 1. Since `num` is already an integer between 1 and 1000, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts from 0, as the loop will iterate from 0 to `num-1`.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
