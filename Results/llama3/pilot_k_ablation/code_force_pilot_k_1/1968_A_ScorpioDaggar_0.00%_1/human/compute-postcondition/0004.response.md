According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains a series of integers representing the test cases minus `num` integers. So for the loop to be executed  the `num` must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains a series of integers representing the test cases minus `num` integers, `i` is 0**
