Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing one integer `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `num - 2` inputs: each an integer `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains the same, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The list `L1` now contains one integer `x` that was input by the user, which is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The list `res` is still empty. The number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1, so it now contains `num - 2` inputs. The value of `i` is still 0.
