Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 7, the program outputs 6, but the correct output should be 6 is not the correct answer because 6 is not less than 7. The correct answer is 1 because gcd(7,1) + 1 = 2 which is the maximum possible value.

The issue with the program is that it finds the first divisor of the number and then calculates the result based on that divisor. However, this approach does not guarantee that the result will be the maximum possible value. A correct approach would be to iterate through all numbers less than the input number and find the one that maximizes the sum of the GCD and the number itself.
