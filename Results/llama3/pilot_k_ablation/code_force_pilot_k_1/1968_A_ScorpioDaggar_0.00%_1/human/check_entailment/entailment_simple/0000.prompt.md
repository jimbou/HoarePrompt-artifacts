Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `num - 1`
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is a list containing `num` integers where each integer is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` for some `j` between 2 and `L1[i]` (inclusive), otherwise `res` contains `num` empty elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `num`.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: the calculated values of the res list, separated by newline characters (where each value is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise an empty element)
