#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `num - 1`
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers `x` (2 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000), `res` is a list containing `num` integers where each integer is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` for some `j` between 2 and `L1[i]` (inclusive), otherwise `res` contains `num` empty elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `num`.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: the calculated values of the res list, separated by newline characters (where each value is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise an empty element)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a specified number of integers from standard input, calculates the product of the quotient and divisor minus one for each integer (if it is divisible by any number between 2 and itself), and prints the calculated values separated by newline characters. If an integer is not divisible by any number between 2 and itself, an empty element is printed. The function does not return any value.
