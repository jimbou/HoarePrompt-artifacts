Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a query function func_1 to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the sequence.

The program first finds the index ans1 of the maximum element in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the index mx of the maximum element among the remaining elements that have the same bitwise OR with ans1. It stores these indices in a list v.

Next, the program finds the index ans of the maximum element among the elements in v by comparing each element with the current maximum. Finally, it prints the result in the format '! ans ans1'.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements, which is a valid operation according to the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
