Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of the values at these indices in a secret permutation is maximized. The program uses a query function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of values in the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first finds the index `ans1` of the maximum value in the permutation by comparing each value with the current maximum using the `func_1` function.
2.  Then, it finds the maximum value `mx` that is not equal to `ans1` by comparing each value with `mx` and `ans1` using the `func_1` function. It stores the indices of these maximum values in the list `v`.
3.  Next, it finds the index `ans` of the maximum value among the values in the list `v` by comparing each value with the current maximum using the `func_1` function.
4.  Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the pair of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses at most 3n queries as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
