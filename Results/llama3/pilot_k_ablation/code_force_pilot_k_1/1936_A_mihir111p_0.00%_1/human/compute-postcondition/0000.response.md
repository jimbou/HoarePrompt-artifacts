Based on the initial state, the variables a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.

When the print statement is executed, it will print a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of a, b, c, and d.

Since the exact values of a, b, c, and d are not provided, we can't compute their exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string '?' followed by the values of a, b, c, and d.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)**
