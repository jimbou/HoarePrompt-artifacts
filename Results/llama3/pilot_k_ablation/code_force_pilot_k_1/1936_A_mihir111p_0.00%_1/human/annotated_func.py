#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that is the user's input, which is expected to be a single character, and this character is one of the integers a, b, c, or d, where a, b, c, d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function prompts the user with a query in the format '? a b c d' where a, b, c, and d are integers within a specified range, and returns the user's input as a single character, which is expected to be one of the integers a, b, c, or d.
