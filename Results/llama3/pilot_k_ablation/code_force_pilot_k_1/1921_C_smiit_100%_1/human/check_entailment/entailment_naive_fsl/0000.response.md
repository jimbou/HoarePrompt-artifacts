Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of phone charge. It iterates through each message, calculates the energy cost of keeping the phone on and turning it off and on, and chooses the minimum cost. If the remaining charge is less than or equal to the energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks the loop. If `possible` is still `True` after iterating through all messages, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the phone's initial charge is 0 or the energy cost of keeping the phone on or turning it off and on is 0. It also handles the case where the phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
