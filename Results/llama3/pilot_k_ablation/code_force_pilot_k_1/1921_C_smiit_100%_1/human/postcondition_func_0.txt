This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs whether it's possible to keep a device on given certain energy constraints. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculating the minimum energy cost to keep the device on between each time interval, and checks if the available energy is sufficient. If the energy is insufficient at any point, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
