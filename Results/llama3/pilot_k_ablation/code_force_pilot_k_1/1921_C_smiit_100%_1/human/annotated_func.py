#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for each iteration, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, stdin is empty, `possible` is not defined, and the output contains `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs whether it's possible to keep a device on given certain energy constraints. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculating the minimum energy cost to keep the device on between each time interval, and checks if the available energy is sufficient. If the energy is insufficient at any point, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
