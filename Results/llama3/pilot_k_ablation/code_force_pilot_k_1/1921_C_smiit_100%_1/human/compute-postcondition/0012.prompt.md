You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes 1 time. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n is at least 1.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list with at least one student, student is the first student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**
Your Task:

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).
Code of the loop:
```
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')

```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for each iteration, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `possible` is False if `f` minus the sum of `energy_cost` is less than or equal to 0 at any point, otherwise `possible` is True. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `f` remains unchanged, `possible` remains True, and 'YES' is printed if `possible` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the first iteration of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
