The code calculates the time difference between the current and previous elements in the list `arr`, then calculates the energy cost of keeping a device on and turning it off and on again. The minimum of these two energy costs is assigned to `energy_cost`.

Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, possible is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on.**
