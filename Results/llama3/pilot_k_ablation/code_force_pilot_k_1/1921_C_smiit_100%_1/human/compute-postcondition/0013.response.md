Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. The function then determines whether it is possible to keep a device on given the energy costs of keeping it on versus turning it off and on again. If the device can be kept on, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
