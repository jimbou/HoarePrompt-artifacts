The code prints 'YES' if the variable `possible` is True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `possible` depends on whether `f` minus the sum of `energy_cost` is less than or equal to 0 at any point during the execution of the loop. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `f` remains unchanged, `possible` remains True.

Output: **YES if f minus the sum of energy_cost is greater than 0 at all points, otherwise NO**
