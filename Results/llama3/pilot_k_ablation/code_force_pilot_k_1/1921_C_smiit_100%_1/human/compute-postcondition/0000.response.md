The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the stdin, the remaining input in the stdin is `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).**
