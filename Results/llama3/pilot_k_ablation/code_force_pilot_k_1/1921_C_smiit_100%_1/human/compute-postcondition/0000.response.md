The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n. The first integer in the stdin is assigned to `t`. The value of `t` is equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n. 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9, 1 <= m_i <= 10^9, and m_i < m_{i + 1}.**
