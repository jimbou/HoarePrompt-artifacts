Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for each iteration, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `possible` is False if `f` minus the sum of `energy_cost` is less than or equal to 0 at any point, otherwise `possible` is True. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `f` remains unchanged, `possible` remains True.**
