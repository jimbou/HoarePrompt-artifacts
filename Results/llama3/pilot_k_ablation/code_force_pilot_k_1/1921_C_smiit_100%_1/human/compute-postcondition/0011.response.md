Output: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), `possible` is True if `f` is greater than or equal to the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `f` is `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n` if `possible` is True, otherwise `f` is `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to the index where `f` becomes less than or equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `possible` is True or False.**
