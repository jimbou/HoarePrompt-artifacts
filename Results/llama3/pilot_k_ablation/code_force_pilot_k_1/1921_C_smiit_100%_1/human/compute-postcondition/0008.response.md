Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the second and first elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. If the current value of `f` minus `energy_cost` is less than or equal to 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of `possible` is not changed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been decreased by the minimum cost of either keeping the energy on or turning it off and on, which is the minimum of `a` times the time difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `possible` is updated based on the new value of `f`.
