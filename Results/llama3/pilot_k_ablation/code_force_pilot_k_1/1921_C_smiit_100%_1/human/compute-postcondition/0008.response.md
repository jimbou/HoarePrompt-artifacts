Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), `i` is 1, `time_diff` is an integer, `energy_keep_on` is an integer, `energy_turn_off_on` is an integer, `energy_cost` is an integer, `f` is `f - energy_cost`. If `f - energy_cost` is less than or equal to 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `f`, which is decreased by `energy_cost`. If the new value of `f` is less than or equal to 0, then `possible` is set to False. Otherwise, the state of `possible` remains unchanged.
