Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases as an integer, each test case is represented by a list of integers, where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The following elements represent the operations, where each operation is a list of two integers, the first integer being the type of operation (1 or 2) and the second integer being the value associated with the operation. The last element of the test case is a list of query integers. This list is an element of list 'b', and its index is calculated as ((original value of `x`) - 1) % `i` + 1, where `i` is an element of list 'a' and 'a' must have at least one element.**
