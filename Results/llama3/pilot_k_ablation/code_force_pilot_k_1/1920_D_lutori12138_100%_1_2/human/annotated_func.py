#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by a list of integers, where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The following elements represent the operations, where each operation is a list of two integers, the first integer being the type of operation (1 or 2) and the second integer being the value associated with the operation. The last element of the test case is a list of query integers.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the element of list `b` that is equal to the value of `x`, where `x` is a list of integers representing test cases, including the number of operations, queries, operations, and query integers.
    #State: *`x` is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases as an integer, each test case is represented by a list of integers, where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The following elements represent the operations, where each operation is a list of two integers, the first integer being the type of operation (1 or 2) and the second integer being the value associated with the operation. The last element of the test case is a list of query integers. Additionally, `x` is not an element of `b`.
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is not in `b`, `x` is ((original value of `x`) - len(a)) % (product of all elements in a) + 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the last element of `a`. If `a` is empty, `x` remains the same as the original value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers representing test cases and two lists `a` and `b` as input. It first checks if the input list `x` is present in list `b` and returns the corresponding element from `b` if found. If not, it modifies the value of `x` by subtracting the length of list `a` and taking the modulus of the product of all elements in `a`, then adds 1. If list `a` is empty, the value of `x` remains unchanged. The function returns the modified value of `x` or the corresponding element from `b` if `x` is present in `b`.
