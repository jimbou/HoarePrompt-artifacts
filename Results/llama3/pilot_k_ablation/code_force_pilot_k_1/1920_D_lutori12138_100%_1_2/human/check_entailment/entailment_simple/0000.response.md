Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array a after a series of operations. The operations can either append an integer x to the end of the array or append x copies of the array to the end of the array.

The program uses a list a to keep track of the size of the array after each operation. It also uses a dictionary b to store the value of the element at each position in the array.

The function resolve_query is used to resolve each query. It first checks if the query is in the dictionary b. If it is, it returns the corresponding value. If not, it iterates through the list a in reverse order and updates the query value using the formula x = (x - 1) % i + 1, where i is the current size of the array. This process continues until the query value is found in the dictionary b.

The program then prints the results of all queries for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct. It correctly handles the two types of operations and resolves each query by iterating through the list a in reverse order.

Correctness: **True**
