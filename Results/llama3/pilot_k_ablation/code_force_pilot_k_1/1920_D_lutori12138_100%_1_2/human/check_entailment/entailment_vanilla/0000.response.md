Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of array a after a series of operations. The program uses a list a to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary b to store the values of the elements in the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and the number of queries. It then reads the operations and updates the list a and dictionary b accordingly.

After reading all the operations, the program reads the queries and uses a function func_1 to resolve each query. The function func_1 takes a query x as input, and returns the value of the x-th element in the array.

The function func_1 works by first checking if x is in the dictionary b. If it is, it returns the value of b[x]. If not, it iterates over the list a in reverse order, and for each size i in a, it calculates the remainder of x-1 divided by i, adds 1 to the result, and assigns it back to x. This process is repeated until x is in the dictionary b, at which point the function returns the value of b[x].

The program then prints the results of the queries for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
