Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query is larger than the size of the array after all operations. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct element in the array.

For example, if the input is:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will not be able to correctly handle the query 20, because the size of the array after all operations is 16, which is less than 20.

The program should handle this case by either returning an error or by correctly calculating the element at the query position.
