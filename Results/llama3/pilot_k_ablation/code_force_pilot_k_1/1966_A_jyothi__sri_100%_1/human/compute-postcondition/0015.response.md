Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, hashmap is a dictionary where keys are integers from arrC and values are their respective frequencies, ans is an integer equal to k-1 if any value in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed which is either k-1 if any value in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has also been decremented by 1. The values of n, k, arrC, hashmap, and ans remain the same as in the initial state. The value of ans is still being printed, and its value depends on the frequencies of the elements in hashmap.
