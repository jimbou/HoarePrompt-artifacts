Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `arrC` and their values are the frequencies of these integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` has a frequency of at least `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`, `t` is decreased by 1, and `stdin` is empty, and ans is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The `stdin` is still empty, and the value of `ans` is printed.
