Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n.**

Explanation: The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k, respectively. The second line reads n integers from stdin and assigns them to arrC. The third line creates an empty dictionary hashmap. The fourth line assigns the value of n to ans. The value of t is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin contains t-1 test cases because two lines have been read from stdin for the current test case.
