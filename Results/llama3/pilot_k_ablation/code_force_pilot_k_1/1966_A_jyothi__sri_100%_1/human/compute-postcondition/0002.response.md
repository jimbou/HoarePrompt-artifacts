The code snippet reads two lines of input for each test case. The first line assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to the variable `arrC`. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `hashmap`. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`.

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and stdin contains `t` test cases, after the execution of the code snippet, stdin will be empty.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `arrC` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.
- `ans` is an integer equal to the value of `n`.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to the value of n, stdin is empty.**
