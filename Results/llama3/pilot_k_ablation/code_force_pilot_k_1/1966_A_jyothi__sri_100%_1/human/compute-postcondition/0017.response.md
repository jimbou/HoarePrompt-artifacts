Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer and determines the minimum value between the count of the most frequent integer (if it occurs at least k times) and k-1. The function then prints this minimum value for each test case, effectively processing and providing output for all test cases in the input.**
