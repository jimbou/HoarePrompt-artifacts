Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the key is the current value of `i` and its value is incremented by 1 if `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, otherwise `hashmap` contains `i` as a key with a value of 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the first integer in the list. The current value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to `k - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 1 and 100, `k` is still between 2 and 100, `arrC` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `hashmap` still contains the current value of `i` as a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, and `stdin` is still empty.
