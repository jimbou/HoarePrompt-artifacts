Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `ans` is an integer equal to the value of `n`, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the first integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `k` remains the same, the list `arrC` is unchanged, a new key-value pair is added to the `hashmap` dictionary where the key is the first integer `i` in the list and its value is 1, the value of `ans` is still equal to `n`, the standard input `stdin` is still empty, and `i` is still the first integer in the list.
