Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, and `ans` is an integer equal to n.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap` has been updated to include `i` as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` and `k` still being integers between 1 and 100 inclusive and 2 and 100 inclusive respectively, `arrC` still being a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` still being the first integer in the list, and `ans` still being an integer equal to n.
