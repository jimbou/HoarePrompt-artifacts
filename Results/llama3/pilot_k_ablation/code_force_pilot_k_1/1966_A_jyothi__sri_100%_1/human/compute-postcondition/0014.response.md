The code prints the value of `ans` which is an integer equal to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` has a frequency of at least `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`. Where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `arrC` and their values are the frequencies of these integers.
Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `arrC` and their values are the frequencies of these integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` has a frequency of at least `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`, and `stdin` is empty, and ans is printed**
