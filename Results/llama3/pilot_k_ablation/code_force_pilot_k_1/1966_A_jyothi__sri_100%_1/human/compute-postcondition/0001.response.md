The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).**
