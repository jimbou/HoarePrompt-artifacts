Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the current value of `i` and its value is incremented by 1, `ans` is an integer equal to the value of `n`, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `i` is a key in `hashmap`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `hashmap` still contains at least one key-value pair, with the key being the current value of `i`, and its value has been increased by 1. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain the same.
