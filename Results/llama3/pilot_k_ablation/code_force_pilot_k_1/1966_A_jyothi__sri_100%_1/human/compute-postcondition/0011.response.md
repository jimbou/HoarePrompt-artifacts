Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the key is the current value of `i` and its value is incremented by 1 if `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, otherwise `hashmap` contains `i` as a key with a value of 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `n` if the current value of `hashmap[i]` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the first integer in the list.***
