The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the values in the `hashmap` dictionary.

The `hashmap` dictionary contains the frequencies of each integer in the `arrC` list. If any value in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `n`.

Since the exact values of `arrC` and `hashmap` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `k-1` or `n`.

Output: **k-1 (if any value in hashmap is greater than or equal to k), otherwise n**
