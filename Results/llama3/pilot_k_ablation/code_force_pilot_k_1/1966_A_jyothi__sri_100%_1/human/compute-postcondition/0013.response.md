The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the frequency of integers in the list `arrC` and the value of `k`. If any integer in `arrC` has a frequency of at least `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in `arrC`.

Since the exact values of `arrC` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `k - 1` or `n`.

Output: **k - 1 (if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k), otherwise n (the number of elements in arrC)**
