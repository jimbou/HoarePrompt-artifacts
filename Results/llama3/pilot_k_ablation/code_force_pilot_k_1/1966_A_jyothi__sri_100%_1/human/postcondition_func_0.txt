This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list so that no element appears at least k times. If no such element exists, it returns the total number of elements. The function prints the result for each test case.
