To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_rep` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0.

The variable `_rep` is not used in the loop body, but its value will be assigned by the loop. At the start of the loop, `_rep` should be 0, which is the initial value for the loop counter.

The state of `stdin` and the input lines containing `a` and `b` are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_rep` is 0**
