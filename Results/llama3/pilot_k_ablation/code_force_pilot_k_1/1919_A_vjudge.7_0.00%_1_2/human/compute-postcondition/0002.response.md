Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_rep` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_rep` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The code assigns the values of `n` and `k` to be integers, which are obtained from the input that contains a space-separated list of integers. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed.
