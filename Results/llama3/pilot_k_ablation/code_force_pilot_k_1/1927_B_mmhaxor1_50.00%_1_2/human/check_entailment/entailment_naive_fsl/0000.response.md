Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input trace contains a value that is greater than or equal to 27. In this case, the program will try to access an index in the string 'sam' that is out of range, resulting in an IndexError.

For example, if the input is:

5
11
0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 28

The program will try to access 'sam[28]', which is out of range, and will raise an IndexError.

The program should be modified to handle this case, for example by using a larger string or by using a different approach to generate the output string.
