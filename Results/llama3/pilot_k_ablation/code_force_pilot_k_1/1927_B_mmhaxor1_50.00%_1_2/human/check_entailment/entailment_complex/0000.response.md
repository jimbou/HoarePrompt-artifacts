Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` generates a string of length `n` based on the given list `a` of non-negative integers. It uses a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the count of each integer in the list and maps each integer to a character in the alphabet string `sam`. The function correctly handles the case where the count of an integer exceeds 26 (the length of the alphabet string) by using the modulo operator to wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet string.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input list `a` contains duplicate integers, as the dictionary `a_map` keeps track of the count of each integer separately.

The function does not modify the input list `a` and returns a string of length `n` as required.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
