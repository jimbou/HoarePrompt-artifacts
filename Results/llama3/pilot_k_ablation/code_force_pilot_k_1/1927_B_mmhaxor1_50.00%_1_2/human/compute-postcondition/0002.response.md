Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < i, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 and values of 1, res is a string of length 1, i is 0**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value of `a_map[a[i]]` to `beg`. Since `a_map` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1` and values of 0, and `a[i]` is a non-negative integer less than `i`, `beg` becomes 0.

The second line appends the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` of the string `sam` to `res`. Since `a_map[a[i]]` is 0, `res` becomes the first character of `sam`, which is 'a'.

The third line increments the value of `a_map[a[i]]` by 1. Since `a_map[a[i]]` is 0, it becomes 1.

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same list of non-negative integers, `sam` remains the same string, and `i` remains 0.
