Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice. The issue lies in the line where it checks if the sum of the remainders of a, b, and c is equal to 3. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

A counterexample is when a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, and d = 0. In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 2. This is because Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, leaving the sequence with two 1s and one 3, which has a XOR of zero.

The correct approach would be to simulate the game and check all possible removals of numbers to find the maximum number of times Bob can win. The program should also consider the cases where the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero after removing one or more numbers.
