Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The program correctly calculates this by summing up the integer divisions of the four numbers by 2, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win when the numbers are removed in pairs.

2. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the remainders of the first three numbers divided by 2 is equal to 3. In this case, Bob can win one more time, so the program adds 1 to the total count.

3. The program reads the input correctly, using `map(int, input().split())` to read the four integers for each test case.

4. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the test cases, and correctly prints the result for each test case.

5. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
