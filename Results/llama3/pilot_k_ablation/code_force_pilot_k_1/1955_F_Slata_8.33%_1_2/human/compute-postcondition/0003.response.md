Output: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), input() returns an integer value greater than 0, and this is printed: the sum of the integer division of a, b, c, d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainder of a, b, c divided by 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0**
