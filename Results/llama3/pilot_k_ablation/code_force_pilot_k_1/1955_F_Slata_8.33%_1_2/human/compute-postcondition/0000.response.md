To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `input()`.

According to the code, `input()` should return an integer value that can be converted to an integer using `int()`. This integer value should be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 0, input() returns an integer value greater than 0**
