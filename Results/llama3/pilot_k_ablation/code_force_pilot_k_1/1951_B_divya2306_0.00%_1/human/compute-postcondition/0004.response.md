Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
