The code prints the value of `wins - 1`, where `wins` is the number of integers in the list `a` that are less than or equal to the integer at index `k - 1` in the list `a`. Since the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` will be at least `k - 1`.

Output: **at least k - 1 (where k is the given integer)**
