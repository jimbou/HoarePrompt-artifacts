Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is at least `k - 2`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and is less than `k - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[wins_with_swap]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
