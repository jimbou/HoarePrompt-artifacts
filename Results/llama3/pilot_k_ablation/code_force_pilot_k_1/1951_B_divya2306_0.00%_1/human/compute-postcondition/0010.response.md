Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `a` contains at least one integer greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first such integer. If all integers in `a` are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `i` is `n`. If the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` is greater than or equal to `k`, the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` minus 1 is being printed.***
