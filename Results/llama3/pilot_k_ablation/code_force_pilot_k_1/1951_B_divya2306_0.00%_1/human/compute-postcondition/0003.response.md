Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `wins` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` is still 0. The current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
