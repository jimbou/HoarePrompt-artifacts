Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus the number of integers in `a` from index `wins` to `k - 1` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is either `n` or the index of the first integer in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]`. If the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `wins - 1` is being printed, and the maximum value between `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)` is being printed.**
