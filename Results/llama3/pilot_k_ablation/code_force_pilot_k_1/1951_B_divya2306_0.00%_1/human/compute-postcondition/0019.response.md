Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus the number of integers in the range `[wins_with_swap, k - 1)` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first integer in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` in the range `[wins_with_swap, k - 1)` or `k - 1` if all integers in the range are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, and the maximum value between `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1` plus 1 if `wins` is greater than 0 is being printed**
