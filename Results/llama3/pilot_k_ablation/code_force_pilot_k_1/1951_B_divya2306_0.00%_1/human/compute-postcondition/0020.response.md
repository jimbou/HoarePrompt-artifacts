Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The function then determines the number of integers in the list that are less than or equal to the `k`-th integer, and prints the maximum of this count minus one and the count of integers that are less than or equal to the `k`-th integer, including the possibility of swapping the `k`-th integer with the next integer in the list. If the number of integers less than or equal to the `k`-th integer is greater than or equal to `k`, the function prints this count minus one. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
