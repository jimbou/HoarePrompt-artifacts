Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus 1 and is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`***
