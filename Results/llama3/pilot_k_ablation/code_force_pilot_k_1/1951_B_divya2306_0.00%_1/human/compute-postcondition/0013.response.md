Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is at least `k - 2`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and is less than `k - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`.**
