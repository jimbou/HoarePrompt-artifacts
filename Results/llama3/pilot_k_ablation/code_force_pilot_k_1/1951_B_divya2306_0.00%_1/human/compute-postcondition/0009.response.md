Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is either `n` or the index of the first integer in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]`. The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value of `wins - 1` is being printed**
