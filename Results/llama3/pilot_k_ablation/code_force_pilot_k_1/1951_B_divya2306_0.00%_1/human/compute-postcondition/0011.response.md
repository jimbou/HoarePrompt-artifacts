Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus 1, `i` is the index of the first integer in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if all integers in `a` are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `wins_with_swap` is calculated by adding 1 to the value of `wins`, which represents the number of integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
