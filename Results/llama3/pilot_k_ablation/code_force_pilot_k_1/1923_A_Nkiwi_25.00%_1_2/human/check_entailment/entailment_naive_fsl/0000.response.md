Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program outputs 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last ones, but it does not consider the case where there are multiple blocks of ones separated by zeros.

In this case, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
