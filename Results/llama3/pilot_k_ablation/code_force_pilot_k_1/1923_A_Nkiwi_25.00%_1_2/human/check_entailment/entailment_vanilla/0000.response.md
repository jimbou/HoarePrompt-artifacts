Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by counting the number of zeros in the array and using that as the answer. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires us to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program's approach does not take into account the actual movement of chips, but rather just counts the number of zeros.

A correct approach would be to find the first and last occurrence of a 1 in the array, and then count the number of zeros between them. This would give us the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

However, the program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
