To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`. The loop will execute if `arrs` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `arrs` to have at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, `cnt1` is 0, `idx` is 0, stdin contains 2t lines**
