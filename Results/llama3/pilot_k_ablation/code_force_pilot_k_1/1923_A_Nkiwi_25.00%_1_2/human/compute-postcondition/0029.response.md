Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs` and equals to either 0 or 1, `idx` is the last index of `arrs`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains 2t lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, the current value of `cnt0` is decreased by one.**

The code simply reassigns the value of `ans` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `ans` still being 0.
