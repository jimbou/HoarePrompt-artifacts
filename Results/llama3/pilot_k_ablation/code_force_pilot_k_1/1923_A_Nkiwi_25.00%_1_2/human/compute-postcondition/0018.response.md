Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, `cnt1` is 0, `idx` is 0, stdin contains 2t lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**
