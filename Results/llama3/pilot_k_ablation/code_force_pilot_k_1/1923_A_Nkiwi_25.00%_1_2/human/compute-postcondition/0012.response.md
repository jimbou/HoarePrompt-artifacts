Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains 2t lines, idx is 0, and either the first element of arrs is not 0 or idx is 0. The current value of the first element of arrs is 1. If the current value of the element of arrs at index idx is 0, then cnt0 is 1. Otherwise, the value of cnt0 remains unchanged.***
