To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` (a throwaway variable) and `t`. Since `_` is not used anywhere, we only need to focus on `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `t` must be at least 1, stdin contains 1+2t lines**
