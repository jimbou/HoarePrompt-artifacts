Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, `idx` is 0, stdin contains 2t lines. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt1` is 0.***
