Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `idx` is the last index of `arrs`, stdin contains 2t lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by one. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
