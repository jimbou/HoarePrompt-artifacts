Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `idx` is the last index of `arrs`, stdin contains 2t lines, and the current value of the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

The code decrements the value of `cnt0` by 1, which means the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element is reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
