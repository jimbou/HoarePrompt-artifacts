Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains 2t lines, idx is not 0 and the first element of arrs is 0. If the current value of arrs[idx] is 0, cnt0 is 1. Otherwise, the value of cnt0 remains unchanged.***
