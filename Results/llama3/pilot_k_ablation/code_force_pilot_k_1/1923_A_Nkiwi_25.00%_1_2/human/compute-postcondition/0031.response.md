Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `idx` is the last index of `arrs`, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs`, stdin contains 2t lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `ans` is decreased by one. Additionally, `cnt1` is more than 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `cnt0`, which represents the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in `arrs`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `ans` is decreased by one. Also, `cnt1` is still more than 1.
