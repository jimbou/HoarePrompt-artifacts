Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt0` is 1, `idx` is not 0, the first element of `arrs` is 0, the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, and stdin contains 2t lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `idx`, and the first element of `arrs` are still valid. The stdin still contains 2t lines.
