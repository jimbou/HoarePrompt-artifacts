Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the input arrays into blocks of consecutive 0s and 1s. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array of 0s and 1s. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the array into blocks of consecutive 0s and 1s, and prints this value. If the array already consists of blocks of consecutive 0s and 1s, or if there is only one 1 in the array, the function prints 0.**
