The only objects in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arrs.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, t must be at least 1, length is an integer, cnt0 is 0, stdin contains 2t lines. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the idx is 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, t must be at least 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt0 is 0, stdin contains 2t lines, idx is 0**
