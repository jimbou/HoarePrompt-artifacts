Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt0` is 1, `stdin` contains 2t lines, `idx` is 0, and either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. The current value of the first element of `arrs` is 1. Additionally, the current value of the element of `arrs` at index `idx` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still has at least one integer, and its first element is still 1. The index `idx` is still 0, and the element of `arrs` at this index is still 0. The input `stdin` still contains 2t lines.
