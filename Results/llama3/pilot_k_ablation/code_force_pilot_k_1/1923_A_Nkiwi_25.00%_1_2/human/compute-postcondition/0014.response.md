Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains 2t lines. If idx is not 0 and the first element of arrs is 0, then if the current value of arrs[idx] is 0, cnt0 is 1. Otherwise, the value of cnt0 remains unchanged. If idx is 0 or the first element of arrs is not 0, then if the first element of arrs is 1 and the current value of the element of arrs at index idx is 0, cnt0 is 1. Otherwise, the value of cnt0 remains unchanged.***
