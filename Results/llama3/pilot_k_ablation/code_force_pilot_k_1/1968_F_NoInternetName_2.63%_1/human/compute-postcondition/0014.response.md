Output: **n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being the cumulative XOR values and their corresponding indices in x, i is 0, l and r are returned values of func_1(int), the current value of lower is the index in inds[x[r]] that is greater than the index in inds[x[r]] where the value is less than l, the current value of upper is the index in inds[x[l - 1]] that is less than or equal to r. The current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, l is less than or equal to the current value of upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to the current value of lower which is less than or equal to r, and 'Yes' is printed**
