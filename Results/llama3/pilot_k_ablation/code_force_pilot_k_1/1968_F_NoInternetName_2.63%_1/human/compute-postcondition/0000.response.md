Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing a single element 0.**

The code snippet provided consists of four lines, each with a distinct impact on the program's state. 

The first line, `n, q = func_1(int)`, assigns the return values of `func_1(int)` to `n` and `q`. Since `n` and `q` are positive integers, their values are updated to the returned values. 

The second line, `a = list(func_1(int))`, assigns the return value of `func_1(int)` to `a`. Since `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, its value is updated to the returned list. 

The third line, `x = [0]`, assigns a list containing a single element 0 to `x`. This line does not affect any other variables. 

The fourth line, `inds = defaultdict(list)`, creates a new dictionary `inds` with a default value of an empty list. The subsequent line, `inds[0].append(0)`, appends the value 0 to the list associated with the key 0 in the `inds` dictionary. 

In summary, the code updates the values of `n`, `q`, and `a` based on the return values of `func_1(int)`, creates a new list `x` containing a single element 0, and creates a new dictionary `inds` with a single key-value pair (0, [0]).
