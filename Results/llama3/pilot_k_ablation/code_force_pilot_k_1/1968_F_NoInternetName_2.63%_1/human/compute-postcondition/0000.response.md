Output State: **n and q are integers, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing a single element 0.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes made by the code:

1. `n, q = func_1(int)`: This line calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument and assigns the returned values to `n` and `q`. Since `func_1` returns values of type `int`, `n` and `q` become integers. Their previous values as positive integers are updated to specific integer values.

2. `a = list(func_1(int))`: This line calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument, converts the returned value to a list, and assigns it to `a`. Since `func_1` returns a value of type `int`, `a` becomes a list containing a single integer. The previous value of `a` as a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 is updated to a list containing a single integer.

3. `x = [0]`: This line assigns a list containing a single element `0` to `x`. The value of `x` is now a list with a single element.

4. `inds = defaultdict(list)`: This line creates a new dictionary `inds` with default values as empty lists.

5. `inds[0].append(0)`: This line appends the value `0` to the list associated with the key `0` in the dictionary `inds`. Since `inds` is a defaultdict, if the key `0` does not exist, it is created with an empty list as its value. Then, the value `0` is appended to this list.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` and `q` are integers, updated from their previous values as positive integers.
- `a` is a list containing a single integer, updated from its previous value as a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30.
- `x` is a list containing a single element `0`.
- `inds` is a dictionary with a single key `0` and a list containing a single element `0`.
