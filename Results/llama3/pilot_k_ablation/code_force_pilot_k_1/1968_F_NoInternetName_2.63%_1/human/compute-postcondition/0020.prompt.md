You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element in a, inds is a dictionary where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is 0, i is q, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element in a, inds is a dictionary where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x.

```

Return Postconditions: n is a positive integer, q is 0, i is q, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element in a, inds is a dictionary where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
