Output State: **n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being the cumulative XOR values and their corresponding indices in x, i is 0, l and r are returned values of func_1(int), lower is the index in inds[x[r]] that is greater than the index in inds[x[r]] where the value is less than l, upper is the index in inds[x[l - 1]] that is less than or equal to r.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `lower` and `upper` variables. The first line assigns to `lower` the index in `inds[x[r]]` that is greater than the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the value is less than `l`. The second line assigns to `upper` the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. The third line updates `lower` to be the index in `inds[x[r]]` that is one more than the previously calculated `lower` index. The fourth line updates `upper` to be the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is the same as the previously calculated `upper` index. No other variables are affected.
