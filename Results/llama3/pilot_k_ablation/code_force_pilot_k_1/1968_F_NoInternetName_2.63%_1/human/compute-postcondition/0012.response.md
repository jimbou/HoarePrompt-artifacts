Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, i is 0, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element in a, inds is a dictionary where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index in inds[x[r]] that is one more than the index of the first element less than l, upper is the index in inds[x[l - 1]] that is the index of the first element less than or equal to r. The current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, and the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of upper which is less than or equal to the current value of r, and the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of lower which is less than or equal to the current value of r.***
