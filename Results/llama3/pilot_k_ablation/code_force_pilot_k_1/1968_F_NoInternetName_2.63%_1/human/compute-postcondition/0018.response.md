Postcondition: ***n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being the cumulative XOR values and their corresponding indices in x, i is 0, l and r are returned values of func_1(int), lower is the index in inds[x[r]] that is greater than the index in inds[x[r]] where the value is less than l, upper is the index in inds[x[l - 1]] that is less than or equal to r. If the current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, l is less than or equal to the current value of upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to the current value of lower which is less than or equal to r, then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, either upper is less than or equal to lower, or l is greater than upper, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than or equal to l, and 'No' is printed.***
