Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `x` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `x` and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`. The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`, and 'Yes' is printed**
