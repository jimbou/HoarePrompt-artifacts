Output: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being the cumulative XOR values and their corresponding indices in `x`, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values of `func_1(int)`, and the cumulative XOR value at index `l-1` in `x` is equal to the cumulative XOR value at index `r` in `x`, and 'Yes' is printed**
