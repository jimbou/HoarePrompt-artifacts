Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being the cumulative XOR values and their corresponding indices in `x`, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values of `func_1(int)`, the cumulative XOR value at index `l-1` in `x` is equal to the cumulative XOR value at index `r` in `x`, 'Yes' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it changes the control flow of the program by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving on to the next one.
