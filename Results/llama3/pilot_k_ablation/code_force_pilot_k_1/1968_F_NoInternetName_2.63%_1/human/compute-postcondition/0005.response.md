Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being the cumulative XOR values and their corresponding indices in `x`, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values of `func_1(int)`**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code assigns the returned values of `func_1(int)` to `l` and `r`, but since the specific values returned by `func_1(int)` are not provided, `l` and `r` are described as the returned values of `func_1(int)`.
