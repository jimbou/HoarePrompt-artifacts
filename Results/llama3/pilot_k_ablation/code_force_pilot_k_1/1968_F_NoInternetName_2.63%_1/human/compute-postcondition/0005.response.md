Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `x` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `x` and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`**

The code calls the function `func_1(int)` and assigns its returned values to `l` and `r`. The values of `n`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `x`, and `inds` remain unchanged. The function `func_1(int)` is not defined in the given code snippet, so the exact values of `l` and `r` cannot be determined. However, it is clear that `l` and `r` are now assigned the returned values from the function.
