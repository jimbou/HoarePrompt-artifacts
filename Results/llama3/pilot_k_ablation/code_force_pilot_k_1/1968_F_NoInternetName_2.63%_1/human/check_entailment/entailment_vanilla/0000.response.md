Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.

The program uses a combination of prefix XOR calculation, binary search, and hash map to efficiently solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first calculates the prefix XOR of the input array `a` and stores it in the `x` array. This is done to efficiently calculate the XOR of any subarray in O(1) time.

2. The program then creates a hash map `inds` to store the indices of the `x` array where each XOR value first appears. This is done to efficiently find the first occurrence of a given XOR value in the `x` array.

3. For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is equal to 0. If it is, the program prints "Yes" because the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR.

4. If the XOR of the subarray is not equal to 0, the program uses binary search to find the first occurrence of the XOR value in the `x` array that is greater than or equal to `l`. This is done to find the first possible division point of the subarray.

5. The program then checks if the found division point is within the range of the subarray and if the XOR of the subarray from the division point to `r` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `l` to the division point. If both conditions are true, the program prints "Yes" because the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR.

6. If none of the above conditions are true, the program prints "No" because the subarray cannot be divided into two parts with equal XOR.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
