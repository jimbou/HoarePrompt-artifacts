Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the XOR of values from each part are equal.

The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each XOR value in the array `x`. For each query, it checks if the XOR value of the subarray is equal to the XOR value of the entire array. If it is, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it uses the `func_2` function to find the indices of the XOR value in the `inds` dictionary.

The `func_2` function is a binary search function that finds the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the given predicate. In this case, the predicate is whether the index is less than `l` or greater than `r`.

The program then checks if the indices found by `func_2` are within the range of the subarray. If they are, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the subarray has only one element or where the XOR value of the subarray is equal to the XOR value of the entire array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
