Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray within a given list of integers is "interesting," meaning that it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.

Function `func_1` is used to read input values and convert them to the desired type. Function `func_2` performs a binary search on a list using a given predicate function. Function `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem.

In `func_3`, the program first reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q` using `func_1`. It then reads the list of integers `a` using `func_1`. The program calculates the cumulative XOR values of the list `a` and stores them in the list `x`. It also creates a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of the cumulative XOR values.

The program then iterates over the queries. For each query, it reads the range of indices `l` and `r` using `func_1`. If the cumulative XOR value at index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR value at index `r`, the program prints 'Yes' because the subarray from `l` to `r` is already "interesting".

Otherwise, the program uses `func_2` to find the lower and upper bounds of the indices in the dictionary `inds` that correspond to the cumulative XOR value at index `r` and the cumulative XOR value at index `l-1`, respectively. If the upper bound is greater than the lower bound and both bounds are within the range of indices `l` to `r`, the program prints 'Yes' because the subarray from `l` to `r` can be divided into two parts with equal cumulative XOR values. Otherwise, the program prints 'No'.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem by using the cumulative XOR values and the dictionary `inds` to efficiently find the indices that correspond to the desired cumulative XOR values.
