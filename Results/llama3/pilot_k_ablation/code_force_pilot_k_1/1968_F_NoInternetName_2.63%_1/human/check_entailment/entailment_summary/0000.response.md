Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether a given subarray is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the XOR of values from each part are equal.

2. Function `func_1` takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified casting function to each value, and returns a map object containing the casted values. This function is used to read input values.

3. Function `func_2` searches for the first element in a list that satisfies a given predicate function and returns its index, or the length of the list if no such element exists. This function is used to find the indices of elements in the `inds` dictionary.

4. Function `func_3` is the main function that determines whether a subarray is interesting. It calculates the XOR of all elements in the list `a` and stores the results in the `x` list. It also creates a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of elements with the same XOR value.

5. For each query, `func_3` checks if the XOR of the elements in the specified range is 0. If it is, the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subarray within the range that has an XOR of 0 by searching for a pair of indices in the `inds` dictionary that satisfy the condition. If such a pair is found, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is interesting based on the XOR of its elements. It uses the `inds` dictionary to efficiently search for pairs of indices that satisfy the condition, making it scalable for large inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
