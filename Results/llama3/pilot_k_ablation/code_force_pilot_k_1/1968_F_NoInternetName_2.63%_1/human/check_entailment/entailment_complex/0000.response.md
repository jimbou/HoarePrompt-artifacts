Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray within a given list of integers is interesting, i.e., it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.

The program uses a cumulative XOR approach to efficiently calculate the XOR of subarrays. It first calculates the cumulative XOR of the entire array and stores it in the list `x`. Then, for each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` is equal to the XOR of the entire array. If it is, the subarray is interesting and the program prints 'Yes'.

If the XOR of the subarray is not equal to the XOR of the entire array, the program uses a binary search approach to find the indices of the cumulative XOR values that are equal to the XOR of the subarray. It uses the `func_2` function to perform the binary search.

The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case the XOR of the subarray is equal to the element itself.

The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray has more than one element, in which case it checks if the XOR of the subarray can be divided into k>1 parts such that the XOR of each part is equal.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and prints 'Yes' if the subarray is interesting and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
