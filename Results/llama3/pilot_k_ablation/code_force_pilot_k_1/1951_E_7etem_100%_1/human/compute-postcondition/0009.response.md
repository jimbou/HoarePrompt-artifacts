Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is an odd number. `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`. The current value of `func_1(ch[:b])` is True. `a` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `ch` remains unchanged, consisting of lowercase Latin characters with an odd length. The integer `b` is still equal to half of the length of `ch`. The function `func_1` still returns True for the first half of `ch`. Additionally, a new variable `a` has been introduced with a value of 1.
