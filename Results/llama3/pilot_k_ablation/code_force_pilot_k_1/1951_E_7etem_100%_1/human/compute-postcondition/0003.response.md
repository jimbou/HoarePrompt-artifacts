The code assigns the value 3 to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The length of `ch` is still even, and `b` is still an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`. The value of `b` is still such that `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True.

Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, and `a` is 3.**
