Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, and `a` is 4.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `a` and assigned it the value 4. The values of the other variables, `ch` and `b`, remain unchanged, as does the return value of `func_1(ch[:b])`. The length of `ch` is still even, and `b` is still equal to half of the length of `ch`.
