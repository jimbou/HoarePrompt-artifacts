Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, `a` is 4, and the function `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`**

In this output state, a new variable `a` is introduced and assigned the value 4. The values of the other variables, `ch` and `b`, remain unchanged, as well as the return value of the function `func_1(ch[:b])`. The length of `ch` is still even, and `b` is still equal to half of the length of `ch`.
