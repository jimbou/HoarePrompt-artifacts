Postcondition: ***`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters. If the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, then `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is an odd number, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, and `func_1` returns True when applied to the first half of `ch`, then `a` is 1. If the length of `ch` is an odd number and `func_1` returns False when applied to the first half of `ch`, then `a` is 2.***
