You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string of lowercase Latin characters.
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if (len(ch) % 2 == 0) :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 3
        else :
            a = 4
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, and `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`. If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4.
    else :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 1
        else :
            a = 2
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is an odd number. `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`. If `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the first half of `ch`, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters. If the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, then `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is an odd number, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`, and `func_1` returns True when applied to the first half of `ch`, then `a` is 1. If the length of `ch` is an odd number and `func_1` returns False when applied to the first half of `ch`, then `a` is 2.
    return a
    #The program returns an integer value 'a' that depends on the length of string 'ch' and the result of function func_1 applied to the first half of 'ch'. If the length of 'ch' is even, 'a' is 3 if func_1 returns True, and 4 if func_1 returns False. If the length of 'ch' is odd, 'a' is 1 if func_1 returns True, and 2 if func_1 returns False.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an integer value 'a' that depends on the length of string 'ch' and the result of function func_1 applied to the first half of 'ch'. If the length of 'ch' is even, 'a' is 3 if func_1 returns True, and 4 if func_1 returns False. If the length of 'ch' is odd, 'a' is 1 if func_1 returns True, and 2 if func_1 returns False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
