Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half of the length of `ch`.**

In this output state, the value of `ch` remains unchanged as it was initially a string of lowercase Latin characters. The new variable `b` is introduced and assigned the value of half of the length of `ch`. The length of `ch` is an integer, and since `b` is calculated as half of this length, `b` is also an integer.
