In natural language, the output state is: The string `ch` remains unchanged, still consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The integer `b` remains equal to half of the length of `ch`, which is still an odd number. A new variable `a` is introduced and assigned the value 2. The function `func_1` still returns `False` for the first half of the string `ch`.
