Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of multiple functions and uses a combination of conditional statements and function calls to determine the correct partitioning of the input string.

The program first checks if the input string is a palindrome or if it can be partitioned into two substrings that are palindromes. If neither of these conditions is true, it calls function `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is equal to the reverse of the second half. If this condition is true, it calls function `func_2` to determine the correct partitioning of the string.

Function `func_1` checks if the first half of a given string is equal to the reverse of the second half. If the string length is even, it compares the first half with the reverse of the second half. If the string length is odd, it compares the first half with the reverse of the second half, excluding the middle character.

Function `func_2` takes a string as input and returns an integer value based on the length of the string and the result of applying function `func_1` to the first half of the string. If the string length is even, it returns 3 if `func_1` returns True and 4 if `func_1` returns False. If the string length is odd, it returns 1 if `func_1` returns True and 2 if `func_1` returns False.

The program then uses the return value of `func_2` to determine the correct partitioning of the string. If the return value is 1, it partitions the string into two substrings. If the return value is 2, it partitions the string into three substrings. If the return value is 3, it partitions the string into two substrings, excluding the middle character. If the return value is 4, it does not partition the string.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly checks for palindromes and partitions the string into substrings that are not palindromes. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
