Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine the partitioning strategy, respectively.

The main part of the program iterates over each test case, checks if the input string is a palindrome using `func_1`, and then applies the partitioning strategy based on the result of `func_2`. If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partitioned substrings. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input string is a single character or when the string is a palindrome. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` helps to simplify the logic and make the program more readable.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program. For example, the variable names `T1` and `T2` are not very descriptive, and the program could benefit from more comments to explain the logic behind the partitioning strategy.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
