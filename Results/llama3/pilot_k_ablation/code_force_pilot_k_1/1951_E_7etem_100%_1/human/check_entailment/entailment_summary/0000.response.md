Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine the number of parts a string needs to be partitioned into, respectively.

The main program first checks if the input string is a palindrome or if it can be partitioned into two palindromes. If not, it calls func_1 to check if the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromes. If func_1 returns True, the program then calls func_2 to determine the number of parts the string needs to be partitioned into.

The program then uses the result of func_2 to partition the string accordingly. If the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromes, the program prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the partitioned string. If the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromes, the program prints "NO".

Based on the execution summaries of func_1 and func_2, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. func_1 correctly checks if the first half of a string is equal to the reverse of the second half, and func_2 correctly determines the number of parts a string needs to be partitioned into based on its length and the result of func_1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
