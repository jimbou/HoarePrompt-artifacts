Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine the partitioning strategy, respectively.

The main program logic checks if the input string is a palindrome or a repetition of a single character or a pair of characters. If it is not, the program calls `func_1` to check if the string is a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, the program calls `func_2` to determine the partitioning strategy based on the length of the string and the result of `func_1` applied to the first half of the string.

The program then uses the partitioning strategy to split the string into substrings and checks if each substring is not a palindrome. If all substrings are not palindromes, the program prints "YES" and the partitioned substrings. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program correctly implements the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine the partitioning strategy, respectively. The main program logic correctly uses these functions to partition the string and check if each substring is not a palindrome.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
