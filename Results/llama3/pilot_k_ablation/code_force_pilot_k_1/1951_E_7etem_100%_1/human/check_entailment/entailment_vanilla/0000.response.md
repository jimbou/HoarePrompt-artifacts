Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings that are not palindromes. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

`func_2` takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome using `func_1`. If the string is a palindrome, it returns a value based on the length of the string and whether it is even or odd. If the string is not a palindrome, it returns a different value.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a string and checks if it is a palindrome using `func_2`. If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the number of parts needed to partition the string (which is always 1 in this case). It then prints the original string as the partition.

If the string is a palindrome, the program checks if it consists only of the same character (i.e., all 'l's). If it does, it prints "NO" because there is no way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the number of parts needed to partition the string (which is always 3 in this case). It then prints three substrings: the first two characters, the middle character, and the last two characters.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
