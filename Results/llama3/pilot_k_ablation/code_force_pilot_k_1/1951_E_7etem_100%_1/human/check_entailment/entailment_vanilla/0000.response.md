Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

`func_2` takes a string `ch` as input and returns an integer value based on the length and palindromic properties of the string. The function uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome. If the length of the string is even and the first half is a palindrome, the function returns 3. If the length is even and the first half is not a palindrome, the function returns 4. If the length is odd and the first half is a palindrome, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns 2.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires partitioning the string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program does not attempt to partition the string in any way.

2. The program does not handle the case where the input string is a single character. In this case, the string is a palindrome, and the program should return "NO".

3. The program does not handle the case where the input string has only two characters. In this case, the string is not a palindrome, and the program should return "YES" with the original string as the partition.

4. The program does not handle the case where the input string has more than two characters. In this case, the program should attempt to partition the string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome.

5. The program does not print the required output. The problem requires printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of partitions and the partitions themselves. The program does not print any output.

In conclusion, the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem, does not handle edge cases, and does not print the required output.

Correctness: **False**
