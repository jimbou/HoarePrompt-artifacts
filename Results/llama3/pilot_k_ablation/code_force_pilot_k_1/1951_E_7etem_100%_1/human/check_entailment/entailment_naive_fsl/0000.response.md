Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to partition the string into some substrings, such that each substring is not a palindrome. However, the program does not attempt to partition the string in any way. Instead, it defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be checking if a given string is a palindrome or not. But these functions are not used to solve the problem.

For example, if the input string is "abba", the program should output "YES" and partition the string into two substrings "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes. However, the program does not do this. It simply checks if the string is a palindrome using `func_1` and `func_2`, but does not attempt to partition the string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description and does not attempt to solve the problem as required.
