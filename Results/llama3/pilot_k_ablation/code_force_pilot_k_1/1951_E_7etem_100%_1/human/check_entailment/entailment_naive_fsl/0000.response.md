Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to partition the string into some substrings, such that each substring is not a palindrome. However, the program does not provide a way to partition the string. It only checks if the string is a palindrome or not.

For example, if the input string is "abba", the program will return True, indicating that the string is a palindrome. However, the problem description requires the program to partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes. In this case, a possible partition is ["ab", "ba"], which are not palindromes.

The program does not provide a way to generate such partitions, and therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
