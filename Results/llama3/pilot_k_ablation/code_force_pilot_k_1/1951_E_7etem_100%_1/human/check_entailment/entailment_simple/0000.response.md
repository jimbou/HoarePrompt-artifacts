Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to determine the partitioning of the string.

The program first checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome or a repetition of a single character or a repetition of a substring of length 2. If it is, the program prints "NO" as there is no valid partition.

If `s` is not a palindrome or a repetition, the program calls `func_1` to check if the first half of `s` is a palindrome. If it is, the program calls `func_2` to determine the partitioning of `s`.

`func_2` checks the length of `s` and the return value of `func_1` for the first half of `s` to determine the partitioning. If the length of `s` is even, `func_2` returns 3 if `func_1` returns True for the first half of `s`, and 4 otherwise. If the length of `s` is odd, `func_2` returns 1 if `func_1` returns True for the first half of `s`, and 2 otherwise.

Based on the return value of `func_2`, the program partitions `s` into substrings and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If any substring is a palindrome, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, the program prints "YES" and the partitioned substrings.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
