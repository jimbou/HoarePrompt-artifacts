This function checks if the first half of a given string of lowercase Latin characters is equal to the reverse of the second half. If the string length is even, it compares the first half with the reverse of the second half. If the string length is odd, it compares the first half with the reverse of the second half, excluding the middle character. The function returns True if the two halves are equal, and False otherwise.
