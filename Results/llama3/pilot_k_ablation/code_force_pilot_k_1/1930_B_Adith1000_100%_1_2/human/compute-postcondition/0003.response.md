The first line assigns the value of `n - i` to `a[2 * i + 1]`, modifying the list `a` at an odd index. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `a[2 * i]`, modifying the list `a` at an even index. Since `i` is 0, the first line sets `a[1]` to `n`, and the second line sets `a[0]` to 1. The value of `n` and `i` are not changed by the code. Stdin is not affected by the code.

Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 0, a is a list of integers where a[0] is 1, a[1] is n, and the rest of the elements are from 1 to n, stdin contains the remaining lines of input**
