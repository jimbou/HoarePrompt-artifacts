The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer equal to the first line of input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains the remaining lines of input**
