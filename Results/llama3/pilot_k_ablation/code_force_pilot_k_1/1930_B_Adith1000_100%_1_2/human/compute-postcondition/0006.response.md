Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where the elements at even indices are from 1 to `n//2` and the elements at odd indices are from `n - (n//2)` to `n`, except for the last element which is `n//2 + 1`, the length of `a` is odd, stdin contains the remaining lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The list `a` still has an odd length, and its elements at even indices are still in the range from 1 to `n//2`, while its elements at odd indices are still in the range from `n - (n//2)` to `n`. However, the last element of `a`, which is at an odd index, has been updated to `n//2 + 1`. The stdin still contains the remaining lines of input.
