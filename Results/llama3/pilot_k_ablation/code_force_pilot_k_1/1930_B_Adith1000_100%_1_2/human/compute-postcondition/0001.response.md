Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first line of input, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains the remaining lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `n` is the integer value of the first line of input from stdin. The list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Stdin still contains the remaining lines of input, as only the first line was consumed by the code.
