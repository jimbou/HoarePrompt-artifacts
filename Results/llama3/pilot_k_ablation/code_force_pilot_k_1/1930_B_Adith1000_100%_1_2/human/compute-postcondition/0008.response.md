Based on the initial state, the list `a` contains integers where the elements at even indices are from 1 to `n//2` and the elements at odd indices are from `n - (n//2)` to `n`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element of `a` is `n//2 + 1`.

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `a` in the order they appear in the list.

Output: **elements of list a (where elements at even indices are from 1 to n//2 and elements at odd indices are from n - (n//2) to n, and if the length of a is odd, the last element is n//2 + 1)**
