Output: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers where the elements at even indices are from 1 to n//2 and the elements at odd indices are from n - (n//2) to n. If the length of a is odd, the last element of a is n//2 + 1. stdin contains the remaining lines of input, and the elements of list a are being printed**
