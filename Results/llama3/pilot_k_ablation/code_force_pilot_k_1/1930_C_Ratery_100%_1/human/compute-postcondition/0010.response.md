Functionality: **The function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then processes each test case by sorting the integers in descending order, and generates a new sequence where each element is either the corresponding element in the sorted sequence or one less than the previous element in the new sequence. The function prints the maximum element of the sorted sequence followed by the generated sequence.**
