Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the maximum element of `arr` and the second-largest element in `arr`, and `x` is the second-largest element in `arr`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, then the second last element in `ans` is greater than the last element by 1. Otherwise, `x` is less than the maximum element in `ans`.***
