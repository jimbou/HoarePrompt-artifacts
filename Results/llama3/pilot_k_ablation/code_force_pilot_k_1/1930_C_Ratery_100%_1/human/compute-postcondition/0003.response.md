Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the maximum element of `arr` and the second last element is greater than the last element by 1, `x` is the second-largest element in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending a new element which is one less than the last element of `ans`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and the last element of `ans` is still valid, as the last element of `ans` has decreased by 1.
