Output: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the maximum element of `arr` and a sequence of elements where each element is either the corresponding element in `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`, and `x` is the last element in `arr`. If `arr` has only one element, `ans` contains only the maximum element of `arr`, and the elements of `ans` are printed**
