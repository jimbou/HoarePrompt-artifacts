Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the maximum element of arr and the second-largest element in arr, and `x` is the second-largest element in arr, and `x` is less than the maximum element in `ans`**

In this output state, the list `ans` now contains two elements: the maximum element of `arr` and the second-largest element in `arr`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
