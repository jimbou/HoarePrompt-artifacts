Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr` and the second element in `arr`, `x` is the second element in the list and is less than the largest integer in `arr`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements `n` remains the same, the list `arr` remains sorted in descending order with each integer being the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, the list `ans` now contains two elements: the largest integer in `arr` and the second element in `arr`, the value of `x` is still the second element in the list and is less than the largest integer in `arr`, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
