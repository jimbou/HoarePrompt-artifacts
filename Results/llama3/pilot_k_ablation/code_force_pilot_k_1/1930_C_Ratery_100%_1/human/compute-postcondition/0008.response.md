Based on the precondition, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains the maximum element of `arr` and a sequence of elements where each element is either the corresponding element in `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, the maximum element of `arr` is the first element of `arr`.

If `arr` has only one element, `ans` contains only the maximum element of `arr`, which is the only element in `arr`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the maximum element of `arr`, followed by a sequence of elements where each element is either the corresponding element in `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`.

Output: **The maximum element of arr, followed by a sequence of elements where each element is either the corresponding element in arr or one less than the previous element in ans**
