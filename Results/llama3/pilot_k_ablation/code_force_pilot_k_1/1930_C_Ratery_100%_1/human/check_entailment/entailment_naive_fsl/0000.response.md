Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a`. The program first calculates the values `a_i + i` for each element in the array and sorts them in descending order. Then, it constructs the array `b` by iterating over the sorted values and appending the maximum possible value to `b` at each step.

The program correctly handles the case where the same value is inserted multiple times into the set `S`, as it only appends the maximum possible value to `b` at each step. This ensures that the resulting array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible array that can be constructed from the given array `a`.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array `a` contains duplicate values, as it only considers the maximum possible value for each element in the array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a`, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
