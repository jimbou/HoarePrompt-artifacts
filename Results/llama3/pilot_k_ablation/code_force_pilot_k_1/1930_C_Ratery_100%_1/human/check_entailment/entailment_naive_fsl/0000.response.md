Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program first calculates the sum of each element in the array and its index, then sorts the array in descending order. It then constructs the lexicographically largest array by iterating through the sorted array and appending the maximum possible value to the answer array.

The program correctly handles the case where the input array has duplicate elements, as it uses a set to keep track of unique elements. It also correctly handles the case where the input array has elements that are not unique, as it uses the maximum possible value for each element.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array is empty, as it does not attempt to access any elements of the array.

The program's time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and its space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the answer array. Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Note: The program's logic is correct, but it can be optimized further. For example, instead of sorting the entire array, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the maximum elements. However, this optimization does not affect the correctness of the program.
