Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of each array, and the array elements themselves.
2. The `func_1` function sorts the array elements in descending order, which is necessary to find the lexicographically largest array `b`.
3. The program then generates the new sequence `ans` by iterating through the sorted array. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`. If it is, it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`, effectively decreasing the last element by 1. Otherwise, it appends `x` to `ans`. This logic ensures that the resulting sequence `ans` is the lexicographically largest possible.
4. Finally, the program prints the maximum element of the sorted array followed by the generated sequence `ans`, which is the correct output format.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example inputs and outputs demonstrate the program's correctness.

Correctness: **True**
