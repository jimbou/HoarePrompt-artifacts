Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters in s plus 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code executes as follows: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The third line finds the index of the first 'B' character in `s` and assigns it to `first_black`. The fourth line finds the index of the last 'B' character in `s` and assigns it to `last_black`. The fifth line calculates the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters in `s` plus 1 and assigns it to `min_paint`. 

After the code executes, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, `first_black` is the index of the first 'B' character in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last 'B' character in `s`, `min_paint` is the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters in `s` plus 1, `_` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
