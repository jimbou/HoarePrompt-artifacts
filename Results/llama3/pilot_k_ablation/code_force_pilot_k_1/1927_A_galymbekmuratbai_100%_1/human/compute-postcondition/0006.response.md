Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a positive integer t, and each subsequent pair of lines contains a positive integer n and a string s consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates the minimum number of paint required to paint the 'B' characters in each string, which is the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' characters plus one. The function then prints the minimum paint required for each string. After processing all input, the function leaves the program state with t being 0, n and s being the last integer and string read from stdin, and the minimum paint required for each string printed.**
