Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be painted to have all 'B' characters together in the string, which is the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters plus 1. The function then prints this minimum number of characters for each test case.**
