The code prints the value of `min_paint`, which is an integer equal to `last_black - first_black + 1`. This value represents the minimum number of paint operations required to paint a certain area, where `first_black` and `last_black` are integers representing the first and last black pixels in a sequence, respectively.

Output: **last_black - first_black + 1 (where last_black and first_black are integers representing the last and first black pixels in a sequence, respectively)**
