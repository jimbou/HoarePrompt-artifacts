To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, it is already guaranteed to be at least 1. However, to make it explicit, we can adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state is not important.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0**
