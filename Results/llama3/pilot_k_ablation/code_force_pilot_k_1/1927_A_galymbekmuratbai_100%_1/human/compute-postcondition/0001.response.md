To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable, but its value is determined by the range of `t`). Since the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `_` is 0**
