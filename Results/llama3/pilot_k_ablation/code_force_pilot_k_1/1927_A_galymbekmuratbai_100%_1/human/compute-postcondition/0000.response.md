Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a positive integer.
	* `int()` converts this input to an integer.
	* The result is assigned to the variable `t`.

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

* The value of `t` is set to the positive integer read from the first line of input.
* The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, minus the first line that was just read.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each subsequent pair of lines contains a positive integer and a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.**

Note that the subsequent pairs of lines in stdin are still present, as only the first line was read and processed.
