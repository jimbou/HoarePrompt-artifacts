Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, first_black is the index of the first 'B' character in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' character in s, min_paint is the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters in s plus 1, _ is t, stdin contains 0 test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be painted to have all 'B' characters together in the string, which is the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters plus 1. The function then prints this minimum number of characters for each test case.
