Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.

2. The given Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.

3. The program uses the `find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, which represents the first black cell. It uses the `rfind()` method to find the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, which represents the last black cell.

4. The program calculates the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white by subtracting the index of the first black cell from the index of the last black cell and adding 1. This is because the segment includes both the first and last black cells.

5. The program prints the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white for each test case.

6. The program correctly handles the case where there is only one black cell, as `find()` and `rfind()` will return the same index, and the minimum length will be 1.

7. The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple black cells, as it finds the first and last black cells and calculates the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white.

8. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
