Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.

Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index of the first black cell using `s.find('B')`. This is correct because the `find()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.

2. Then, it finds the index of the last black cell using `s.rfind('B')`. This is also correct because the `rfind()` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value.

3. Finally, it calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white by subtracting the index of the first black cell from the index of the last black cell and adding 1. This is correct because the length of the segment is the difference between the indices plus 1.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When there is only one black cell, the program correctly outputs 1.
* When there are multiple black cells, the program correctly outputs the length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
* When there are no black cells, the program does not need to handle this case because the problem statement guarantees that at least one cell of the given strip is black.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
