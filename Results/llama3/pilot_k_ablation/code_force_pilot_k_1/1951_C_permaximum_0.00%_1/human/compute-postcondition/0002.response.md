Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= min(n*m, 10^9), prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains no input**

The code first reads three positive integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k, respectively. Then, it reads a list of n positive integers from stdin and assigns it to prices. Finally, it calls the function func_1 with n, m, k, and prices as arguments and assigns the return value to result. The values of t and _ remain unchanged. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
