Output State: **t is greater than 0, n, m, and k are positive integers, prices is a list of n positive integers, stdin contains t-2 inputs, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices)**

The first line assigns the values of the first three inputs from stdin to n, m, and k, respectively. Since n, m, and k are positive integers, their values are updated accordingly. Stdin now contains t-2 inputs.

The second line assigns a list of n positive integers from stdin to prices. Since prices is a list of n positive integers, its value is updated accordingly. Stdin is now empty.

The third line assigns the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices) to result. Since the output of func_1 is not specified, the value of result is not determined. However, since func_1 takes n, m, k, and prices as inputs, the values of these variables are used in the function call.

In summary, the code updates the values of n, m, k, and prices, and assigns the output of func_1 to result. The value of t remains greater than 0, and stdin contains t-2 inputs.
