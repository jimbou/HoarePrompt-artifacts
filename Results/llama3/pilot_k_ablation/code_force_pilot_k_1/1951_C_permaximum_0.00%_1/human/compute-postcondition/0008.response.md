Functionality: This function calculates the minimum amount of money needed to purchase a specified number of tickets, given a list of prices per ticket for each day and constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day. It takes four parameters: the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, the total number of tickets to buy, and a list of prices per ticket for each day. The function returns the total cost of the tickets, which is calculated by sorting the prices and buying the cheapest tickets first, up to the specified total number of tickets or the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day, whichever is smaller. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed the specified total number of tickets.
