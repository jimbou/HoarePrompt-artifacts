Output State: **The program returns the total cost of k tickets, where k is a positive integer less than or equal to the product of n and m, and the tickets are bought from a sorted list of n positive integers.**

In this output state, the total cost is the sum of the costs of k tickets, where the cost of each ticket is determined by the sorted list of prices. The number of tickets bought (k) is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the product of the number of rows (n) and the number of seats in each row (m). The loop that calculates the total cost executes once if k is less than or equal to m, and executes multiple times until k tickets are bought if k is greater than m. If k is 0, the loop does not execute and the total cost is 0.
