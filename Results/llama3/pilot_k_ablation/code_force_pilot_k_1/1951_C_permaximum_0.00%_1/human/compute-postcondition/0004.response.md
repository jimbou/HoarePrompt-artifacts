Output: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= min(n*m, 10^9), prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains no input, and the result (which is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices)) is being printed**
