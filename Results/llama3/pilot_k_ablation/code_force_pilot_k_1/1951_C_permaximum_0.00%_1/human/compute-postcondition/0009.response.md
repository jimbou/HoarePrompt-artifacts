Functionality: This function calculates the minimum amount of money needed to purchase a specified number of tickets, given a list of prices per ticket for each day and the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day. It takes four parameters: the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, the total number of tickets to buy, and a list of prices per ticket for each day. The function returns the total cost of the tickets, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase the specified number of tickets. The function sorts the prices in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted prices, buying as many tickets as possible each day until the total number of tickets to buy is reached. The function returns the total cost of the tickets, which is the sum of the costs of all the tickets bought.
