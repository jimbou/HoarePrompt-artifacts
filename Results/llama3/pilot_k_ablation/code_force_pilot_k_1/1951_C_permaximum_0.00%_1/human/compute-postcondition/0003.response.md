The code prints the value of `result` which is the output of the function `func_1` called with arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.
Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function `func_1` with the given arguments.
Output: **result (where result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
