The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= min(n*m, 10^9), prices is a list of n positive integers does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that k <= min(n*m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n positive integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
