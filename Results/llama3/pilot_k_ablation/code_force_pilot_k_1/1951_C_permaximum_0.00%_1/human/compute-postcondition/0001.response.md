To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable in the loop head, which is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state is not important.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs**
