Correctness: **False** 

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the prices are updated after purchasing tickets. The program sorts the prices at the beginning, but it does not update the prices correctly after purchasing tickets. The prices should be updated by adding the number of tickets purchased to the prices of the remaining days.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    """Calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

    Args:
        n: The number of sale days.
        m: The maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
        k: The total number of tickets to buy.
        prices: A list of prices per ticket for each day.

    Returns:
        The minimum amount of money needed to purchase k tickets.
    """
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    prices = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(prices)
    
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(prices)
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        cost = tickets_to_buy * price
        total_cost += cost
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        # Update prices for the remaining days
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            prices[i] = (prices[i][0] + tickets_to_buy, prices[i][1])
        heapq.heapify(prices)
    
    return total_cost

def func_2():
    """Handles input and output for multiple test cases."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        print(result)

func_2()
```

This solution uses a priority queue (implemented as a heap) to keep track of the prices. After purchasing tickets, it updates the prices by adding the number of tickets purchased to the prices of the remaining days. This ensures that the prices are correctly updated and the minimum spending is calculated correctly.
