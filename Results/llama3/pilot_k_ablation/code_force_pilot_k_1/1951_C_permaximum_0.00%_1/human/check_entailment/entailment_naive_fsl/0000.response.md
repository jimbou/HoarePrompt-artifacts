Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem states that the price per ticket increases by x if x tickets are purchased on day i, but the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and buys the tickets at the lowest prices without considering the increase in price due to previous purchases.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will buy 2 tickets on the first day at a price of 8, and then buy 1 ticket on the second day at a price of 6. However, the correct solution should buy 0 tickets on the first day, 0 tickets on the second day, 1 ticket on the third day at a price of 4, and 2 tickets on the fourth day at a price of 3 (after the price increase due to the purchase on the third day). The program's solution does not take into account the price increase and therefore does not produce the correct result.
