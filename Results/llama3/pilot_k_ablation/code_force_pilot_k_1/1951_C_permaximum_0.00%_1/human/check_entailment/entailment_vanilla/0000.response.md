Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (m) and the price per ticket for each day.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes the number of sale days (n), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (m), the total number of tickets to buy (k), and a list of prices per ticket for each day as input. It sorts the prices in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted prices. For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy, which is the minimum of the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (m) and the remaining number of tickets to buy (k - tickets_bought). It then calculates the cost of buying these tickets and adds it to the total cost. The function continues this process until all tickets have been bought.

Function 2 (`func_2`) handles input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, the total number of tickets to buy, and the list of prices per ticket for each day. It then calls Function 1 with these inputs and prints the result.

However, there is a flaw in the program. The problem statement mentions that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. This means that the prices should be updated after each purchase, but the program does not do this. It simply sorts the prices once and then uses the sorted prices for all purchases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
