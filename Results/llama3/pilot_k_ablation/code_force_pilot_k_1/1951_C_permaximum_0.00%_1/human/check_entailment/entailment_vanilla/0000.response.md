Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of maximum tickets purchasable per day (m) and the price increase after purchasing tickets.

Function 1, `func_1`, attempts to solve this problem by sorting the prices and then iterating through them. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1.  The function sorts the prices, which is not necessary and can be inefficient for large inputs. The prices should be processed in the order they are given, as the problem statement implies that the prices are time-dependent.
2.  The function calculates the cost by multiplying the tickets to buy by the current price. However, this does not take into account the price increase after purchasing tickets. The correct approach would be to add the tickets purchased to the total cost and then update the prices for the remaining days.
3.  The function breaks the loop when the total tickets bought equals k. However, this does not guarantee that the minimum spending is achieved, as the function does not consider the optimal distribution of tickets across days.

Function 2, `func_2`, handles input and output for multiple test cases but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
