Reasoning:

The problem description requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days, and the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (m). The problem also states that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x.

Function 1 sorts the prices in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted prices, buying as many tickets as possible each day until the total number of tickets to buy is reached. However, this approach does not take into account the price increase caused by purchasing tickets on previous days.

For example, in the first test case, the prices are [8, 6, 4, 2]. If we sort the prices, we get [2, 4, 6, 8]. If we buy 2 tickets on the first day (price 2), the prices for the remaining days will become [4, 6, 8]. However, the function will still buy 1 ticket on the second day (price 4), which is not the optimal solution.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the problem description, and the correctness is False.

Correctness: **False**
