Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day and the price increase after each purchase.

Function `func_1` calculates the minimum spending by sorting the prices and then buying the minimum number of tickets possible each day until all k tickets are bought. This approach ensures that the minimum amount of money is spent, as it prioritizes buying tickets on days with lower prices.

Function `func_2` handles the input and output for multiple test cases by reading the input parameters, calling `func_1` with these parameters, and printing the result for each case.

The program correctly implements the problem's constraints and logic, and the functions work together to provide the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
