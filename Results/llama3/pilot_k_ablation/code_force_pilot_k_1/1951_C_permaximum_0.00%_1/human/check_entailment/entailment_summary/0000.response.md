Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not take into account the price increase after purchasing tickets. The problem statement clearly mentions that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. However, the program does not implement this logic.

In the func_1 function, the prices are sorted in ascending order, and then the program iterates over the sorted prices, buying as many tickets as possible each day until the total number of tickets to buy is reached. However, this approach does not consider the price increase after purchasing tickets.

For example, in the first test case, the program will buy 0 tickets on the first day, 0 tickets on the second day, 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4, and 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6. However, after buying 1 ticket on the third day, the prices for the remaining days should be increased by 1, which is not considered in the program.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
