To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`, specifically, as long as there are more lines to read. Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, which reads the first line of each test case containing the integer `t`, we need to ensure that `stdin` contains at least one line with an integer value for `t`.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one line with an integer value for `t`, `_` is 0**
