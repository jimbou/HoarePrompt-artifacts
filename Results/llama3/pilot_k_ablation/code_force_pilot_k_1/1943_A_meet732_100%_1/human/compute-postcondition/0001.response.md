Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now a positive integer. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The third line creates a list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
