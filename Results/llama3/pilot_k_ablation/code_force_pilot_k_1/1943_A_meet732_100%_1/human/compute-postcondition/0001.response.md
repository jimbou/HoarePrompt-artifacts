Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

The code block reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The third line creates a list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
