Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `stdin` contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, and `j` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive) if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `j` is 1. If the loop executed, either `c` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is 0. If the loop did not execute, `n` is 0.***
