Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if there exists a `j` between 1 and `n` (inclusive) such that `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `j` is printed. If no such `j` exists, no value is printed.***
