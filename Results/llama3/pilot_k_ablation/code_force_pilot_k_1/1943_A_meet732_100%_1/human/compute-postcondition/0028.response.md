Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then finds the smallest positive integer that is not present in the input integers for each test case, printing this integer. If the smallest missing positive integer is 1, it prints 0 instead. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
