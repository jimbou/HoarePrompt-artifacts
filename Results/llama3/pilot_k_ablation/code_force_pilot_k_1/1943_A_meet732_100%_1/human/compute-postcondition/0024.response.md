Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, or continues execution with `c` being either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `c` is 2 since `cntl[0]` is larger than 2.***
