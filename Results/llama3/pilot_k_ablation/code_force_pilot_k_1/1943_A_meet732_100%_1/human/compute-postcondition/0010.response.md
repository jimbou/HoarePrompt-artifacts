According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1. The variable `j` is also in the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1**
