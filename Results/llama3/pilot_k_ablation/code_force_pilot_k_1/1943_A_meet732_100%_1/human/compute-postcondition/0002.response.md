To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are variable `i` and list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `stdin` contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, and `_` is 0. However, these states do not guarantee the loop will execute, so we need to adjust them.

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least 1 integer, and `i` is now the first integer in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `stdin` contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list**
