Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `c` is either 0 or 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2 for any `j` in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive), then the loop breaks and prints `j`. Otherwise, the loop completes without printing any value.**
