Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is larger than 0**

The code decrements the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was initially 2, its new value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is still a list of integers, `cntl` is still a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is still 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is still larger than 0.
