Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is larger than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `stdin`, and `j` remain unchanged. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
