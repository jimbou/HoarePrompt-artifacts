Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `_`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line outside the loop or if statement.
