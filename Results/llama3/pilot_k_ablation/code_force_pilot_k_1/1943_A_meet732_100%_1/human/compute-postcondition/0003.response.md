Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The rest of the values in the `cntl` list remain 0. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `_`, retain their original values.
