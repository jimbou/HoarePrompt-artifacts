The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl` at index `i` by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, we can say that `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is the first integer in the list.

After executing the code, the value of `cntl` at index `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[a[0]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is the first integer in the list.**
