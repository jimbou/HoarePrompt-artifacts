Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is larger than 0, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
