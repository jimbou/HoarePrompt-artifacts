Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is either 1 or 2 because `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, so `min(2, cntl[0])` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
