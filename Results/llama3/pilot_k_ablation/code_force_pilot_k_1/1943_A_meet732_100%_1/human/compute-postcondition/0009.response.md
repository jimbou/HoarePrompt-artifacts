Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `c` is 2 since cntl[0] is larger than 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still a positive integer, the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cntl` still contains the count of each integer in `a`, and a new variable `c` is introduced with a value of 2, since `cntl[0]` is larger than 2. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
