Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least one line with a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is more than 0***
