Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in list `a` for all `i` in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, indicating that the number 0 does not appear in list `a`.**
