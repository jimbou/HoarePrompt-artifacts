Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (for Alice) or simply deleting them from `a` (for Bob). The goal is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

3. It then initializes a count list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. This list is used to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.

4. The program then iterates over the array `a` and increments the corresponding count in the `cntl` list for each element.

5. If the count of 0 in `cntl` is 0, it means that 0 is not present in the array `a`, so the MEX is 0. In this case, the program prints 0.

6. Otherwise, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0 in `cntl`. This variable `c` is used to keep track of the number of times Alice can pick a 0 without making the MEX of `c` greater than 1.

7. The program then iterates over the `cntl` list starting from index 1. For each index `j`, if the count of `j` in `cntl` is less than 2, it means that `j` can be the MEX of `c`. If the count of `j` is 0, it means that `j` is not present in `a`, so the MEX is `j`. In this case, the program prints `j` and breaks the loop.

8. If the count of `j` is 1, it means that `j` is present in `a` but can still be the MEX of `c`. In this case, the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it means that Alice cannot pick any more 0s without making the MEX of `c` greater than 1, so the MEX is `j`. In this case, the program prints `j` and breaks the loop.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the final score of the game. It handles all possible cases and prints the correct MEX for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
