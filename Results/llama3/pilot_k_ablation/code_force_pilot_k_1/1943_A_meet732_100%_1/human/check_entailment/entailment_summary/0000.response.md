Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. If 0 is not present in the array, the program prints 0 as the score. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0. This variable `c` is used to keep track of the number of times Alice can choose a number that is not 0.

The program then iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If a number `j` has a count less than 2, it means that Bob can choose this number to minimize the score. If the count of `j` is 0, it means that Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, and the program prints `j` as the score. If the count of `j` is 1, it means that Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, but Bob can also choose this number to minimize the score. In this case, the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it means that Alice has used up all her chances to choose a number that is not 0, and the program prints `j` as the score.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the input array contains only 0s or only 1s. It also correctly handles the case where the input array contains a mix of 0s and 1s.

Correctness: **True**
