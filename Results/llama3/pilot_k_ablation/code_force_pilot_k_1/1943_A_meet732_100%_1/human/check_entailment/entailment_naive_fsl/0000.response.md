Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The strategy is to first count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. Then, it checks if the number 0 is present in the array. If it is not present, the MEX of the array `c` will be 0, so the program prints 0. If 0 is present, the program sets a counter `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0's. This is because Alice can choose at most two 0's to maximize the score.

Then, the program iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n` (the size of the array `a`). For each number `j`, if its count in `cntl` is less than 2, it means that Bob can choose this number to minimize the score. If the count is 0, it means that the number `j` is not present in the array `c`, so the MEX of `c` will be `j`, and the program prints `j`. If the count is 1, it means that Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, so the program decrements the counter `c`. If `c` becomes 0, it means that Alice has chosen two numbers, and the MEX of `c` will be `j`, so the program prints `j`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the array `a` contains only one number, the case where the array `a` contains only two numbers, and the case where the array `a` contains more than two numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
