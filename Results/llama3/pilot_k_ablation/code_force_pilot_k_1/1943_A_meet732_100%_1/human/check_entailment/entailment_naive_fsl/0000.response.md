Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The key insight is that Alice should aim to create a sequence `c` with the smallest possible MEX (minimum excludant).

The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the input array `a` using the `cntl` list. If 0 is not present in the array, the MEX is 0, and the program prints 0.

Otherwise, the program initializes a variable `c` to 2, which represents the maximum number of 0s that Alice can include in her sequence `c`. The program then iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` (the size of the input array). For each number `j`, if its count in `cntl` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at most one occurrence of `j` from the array. If `cntl[j]` is 0, it means that `j` is not present in the array, and the program prints `j` as the MEX. If `cntl[j]` is 1, it means that Alice can include `j` in her sequence `c`, and the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it means that Alice has included two 0s in her sequence, and the program prints `j` as the MEX.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the input array contains only 0s or only 1s. Therefore, the program is correct.
