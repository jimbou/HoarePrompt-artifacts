Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob tries to minimize it. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and stores them in the list `cntl`. Then, it checks if the number 0 appears in `a`. If it does not, the program prints 0 as the score. If 0 appears in `a`, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the number of times 0 appears in `a`. The program then iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If a number `j` appears less than twice in `a`, the program checks if `j` appears at all in `a`. If `j` does not appear in `a`, the program prints `j` as the score and breaks the loop. If `j` appears exactly once in `a`, the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the program prints `j` as the score and breaks the loop. This strategy ensures that Alice maximizes the score while Bob tries to minimize it.

Correctness: **True**
