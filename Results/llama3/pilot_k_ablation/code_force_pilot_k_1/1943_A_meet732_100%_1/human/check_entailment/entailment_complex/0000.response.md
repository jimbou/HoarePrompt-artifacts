Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of a single integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2.  It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the count of each integer in the input.
3.  It then iterates over the input integers, incrementing the corresponding count in the `cntl` list.
4.  After counting the occurrences of each integer, it checks if the count of 0 is 0. If so, it prints 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.
5.  If the count of 0 is not 0, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0. This variable `c` is used to keep track of the number of times Alice can choose an integer that is not 0.
6.  The program then iterates over the `cntl` list, starting from index 1. If it finds an index `j` where the count is less than 2, it checks if the count is 0. If so, it prints `j`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.
7.  If the count at index `j` is 1, it decrements the variable `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it prints `j`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the game between Alice and Bob, where Alice tries to maximize the score (the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array) and Bob tries to minimize it. The program correctly handles the cases where the smallest missing positive integer is 1, printing 0 instead.

Correctness: **True**
