To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `input()`.

According to the code, `input()` should contain an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) for the loop to execute. This means `y` should be within the range of `t`.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, y is within the range of t**
