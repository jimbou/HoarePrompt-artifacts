Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, rev_res is the concatenation of the strings in operational_list, with even-indexed strings having trailing zeros removed, list_len is at least 0, operational_list is a sorted list of strings from the second line of stdin, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed, and the length of rev_res is less than int(max_power) + 1***
