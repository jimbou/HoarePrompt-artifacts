Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, list_len is an integer that must be at least 1, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, y is within the range of t. If x is even, rev_res is updated by adding the string value of operational_list[x] (with trailing zeros removed) to its current value. If x is odd, rev_res is increased by the second element of operational_list.***
