Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, list_len is at least 1, operational_list is a sorted list of strings from the second line of stdin, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed. If x is even, rev_res is the string operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list.***
