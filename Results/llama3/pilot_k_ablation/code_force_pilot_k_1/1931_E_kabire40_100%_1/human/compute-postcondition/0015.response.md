Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, y is within the range of t, rev_res is a string that contains the concatenation of all the strings in operational_list, with the strings at even indices having their trailing zeros removed. If list_len is 0, rev_res remains unchanged. If the length of rev_res is greater than or equal to the value of max_power plus 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.***
