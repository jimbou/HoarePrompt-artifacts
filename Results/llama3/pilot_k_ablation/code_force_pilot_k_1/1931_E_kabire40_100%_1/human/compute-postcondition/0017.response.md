Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers (n and m) and the second line contains n strings. The function processes each test case by concatenating the strings in a specific order (even-indexed strings have their trailing zeros removed) and then checks if the length of the resulting string is greater than or equal to m+1. Based on this comparison, the function prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' for each test case. If there are no test cases (i.e., the input is 0), the function does not modify the input and leaves it unchanged.**
