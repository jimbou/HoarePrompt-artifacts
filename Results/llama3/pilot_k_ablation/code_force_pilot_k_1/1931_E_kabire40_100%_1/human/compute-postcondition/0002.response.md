To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `list_len`. The loop will execute if `list_len` is at least 1.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, rev_res is an empty string, list_len is at least 1, operational_list is a sorted list of strings from the second line of stdin, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed, x is 0**
