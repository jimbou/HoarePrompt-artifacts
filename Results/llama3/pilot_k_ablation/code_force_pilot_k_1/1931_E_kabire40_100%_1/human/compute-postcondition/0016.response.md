Output State: **stdin is empty, y is equal to t, list_len and max_power are the last values read from stdin, operational_list is the last list of strings read from stdin, rev_res is a string that contains the concatenation of all the strings in operational_list, with the strings at even indices having their trailing zeros removed, for all test cases. If t is 0, stdin remains unchanged, y is 0, list_len and max_power are undefined, operational_list is undefined, and rev_res is an empty string.**
