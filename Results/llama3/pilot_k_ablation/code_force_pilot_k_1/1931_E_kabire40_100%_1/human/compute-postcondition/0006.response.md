The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` adds the string at index `x` in the `operational_list` to the `rev_res` variable. Since `x` is 1, it adds the second element of the `operational_list` to `rev_res`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`rev_res` is increased by the second element of `operational_list`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `list_len` is an integer that must be at least 1, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `y` is within the range of `t`, `x` is 1**
