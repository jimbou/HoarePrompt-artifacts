Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, rev_res is the string that is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list, list_len is at least 1, operational_list is a sorted list of strings from the second line of stdin, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed, x is not divisible by 2**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating the string at index x in operational_list to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the list_len is still at least 1. The operational_list is still a sorted list of strings from the second line of stdin, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed. The value of x is still not divisible by 2.
