The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` adds the string value of `operational_list[x]` (with trailing zeros removed) to the current value of `rev_res`. Since `x` is an even number and `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, the value of `operational_list[x]` is a string. The `rstrip('0')` method removes any trailing zeros from this string.

Output State: **`rev_res` is updated by adding the string value of `operational_list[x]` (with trailing zeros removed) to its current value, stdin contains t-1 test cases, list_len is an integer that must be at least 1, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, y is within the range of t, x is an even number.**
