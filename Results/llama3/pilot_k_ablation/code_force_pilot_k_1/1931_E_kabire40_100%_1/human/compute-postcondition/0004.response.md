Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is the string `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed, `list_len` is at least 1, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the second line of stdin, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed, and `x` is an even number.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still an even number, and the list `operational_list` is still sorted based on the difference in length between each string and its corresponding string with trailing zeros removed. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains t-1.
