Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of integers in each test case, and the integers themselves.
2.  It sorts the integers based on their length without trailing zeros, which is a crucial step in determining the optimal moves for Anna and Sasha.
3.  The program then concatenates the integers in a specific order, alternating between removing trailing zeros and keeping them. This is in line with the game logic, where Anna reverses the digits of an integer and Sasha concatenates two integers.
4.  Finally, the program compares the length of the resulting string to the value of `m` and prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' based on the comparison. This is consistent with the winning conditions described in the problem statement.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
