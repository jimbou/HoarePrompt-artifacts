Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. In the game, Anna can reverse the digits of any number, and Sasha can concatenate any two numbers. However, the program only considers reversing the digits of the numbers in the order they are given, and concatenating the reversed numbers in the same order.

A counterexample is when the input is:

3 5
9 56 1

The program will output "Anna", but the correct output should be "Sasha". This is because Anna can reverse the digits of 9 to get 9, and then Sasha can concatenate 9 with 56 to get 956, which is greater than 10^5.
