Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The problem description states that Sasha must extract two elements from the list, concatenate them in any order, and insert the result back into the list. However, the program does not simulate this process correctly. It simply concatenates the elements in the list without considering the optimal moves for Sasha.

A counterexample is when the input is:

3 5
9 56 1

The program will output "Anna", but the correct output should be "Sasha". The optimal move for Sasha is to concatenate 9 and 56, resulting in 956, which is greater than 10^5. Then, Anna can reverse 1, but it will not change the outcome. Sasha will win the game.

The program does not consider the optimal moves for Sasha and Anna, and it does not correctly simulate the game process. Therefore, it is incorrect.
