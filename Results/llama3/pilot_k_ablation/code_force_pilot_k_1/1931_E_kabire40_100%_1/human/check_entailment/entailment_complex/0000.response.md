Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal play. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of integers in each test case, and the integers themselves.
2. It sorts the integers based on their length without trailing zeros, which is a crucial step in determining the optimal play. This is because Anna's move involves reversing the digits of an integer, which can potentially remove trailing zeros.
3. The program then concatenates the integers in a specific order, alternating between removing trailing zeros and keeping them. This is consistent with the game logic, where Anna's move involves reversing the digits of an integer, and Sasha's move involves concatenating two integers.
4. The program compares the length of the resulting string to the value of `m`, which determines the winning condition. If the length of the string is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
5. The program prints the correct output for each test case, either "Sasha" or "Anna", based on the comparison in step 4.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal play. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
