Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly sorts the input array, finds the median index, and then increments the index until it finds a value that is not equal to the median value. This is in line with the problem description, which requires finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
