Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's why:

- The program first sorts the array `a` in ascending order. This is necessary to find the median of the array.

- Then, it calculates the index of the median in the sorted array using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`. This is because the median is the middle element in the sorted array. If the length of the array is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but in this problem, we are only concerned with increasing the median, so we can simply consider the smaller of the two middle elements as the median.

- The program then initializes a variable `operations` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of operations required to increase the median.

- The program then enters a while loop that continues as long as `median_index` is less than `n` and `a[median_index]` is equal to the median value. In each iteration of the loop, `median_index` is incremented by 1 and `operations` is incremented by 1. This is because we need to increment all elements that are equal to the median value to increase the median.

- Finally, the program appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list and returns the `results` list.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array by incrementing all elements that are equal to the median value. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
