Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It first sorts the array and then finds the median index and value. It then counts the number of elements that have the same value as the median, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It works for arrays of any length, including arrays with an even or odd number of elements. It also handles arrays with duplicate elements, as it correctly counts the number of elements that have the same value as the median.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It does not have any edge cases that are not handled correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
