Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the number of times `median_index` was incremented until `a[median_index]` was not equal to the element at `(n - 1) / 2` in the sorted list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the second element of the first test case sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(n - 1) / 2` such that `a[median_index]` is not equal to the element at `(n - 1) / 2` in the sorted list `a`, `median_value` is the element at `median_index` in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the number of times `median_index` was incremented until `a[median_index]` was not equal to the element at `(n - 1) / 2` in the sorted list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of results now contains the number of operations performed to find the median index in the sorted list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
