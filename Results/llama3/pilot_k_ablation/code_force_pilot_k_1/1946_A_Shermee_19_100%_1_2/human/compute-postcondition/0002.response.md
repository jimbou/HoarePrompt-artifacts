Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of the first test case, a is the second element of the first test case sorted in ascending order, median_index is the integer division of (n - 1) by 2, median_value is the element at median_index in the sorted list a, operations is 0**

In this output state, the initial state of `test_cases`, `case`, and `results` remains unchanged. The code extracts the first element `n` and the second element `a` from the first test case `case`. The list `a` is then sorted in ascending order. The `median_index` is calculated as the integer division of `(n - 1)` by 2, which gives the index of the median value in the sorted list `a`. The `median_value` is then assigned the value at this index in the sorted list `a`. Finally, the variable `operations` is initialized to 0.
