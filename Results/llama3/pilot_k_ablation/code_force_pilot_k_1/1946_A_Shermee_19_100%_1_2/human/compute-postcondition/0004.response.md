Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, a is the second element of the first test case sorted in ascending order, median_index is the integer division of (n - 1) by 2 plus 1, median_value is the element at median_index in the sorted list a, operations is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `median_index` and `operations`. The first line increments `median_index` by 1, and the second line increments `operations` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
