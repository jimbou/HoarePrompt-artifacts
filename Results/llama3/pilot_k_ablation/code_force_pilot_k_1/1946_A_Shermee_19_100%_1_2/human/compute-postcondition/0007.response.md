Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list containing the number of times `median_index` was incremented until `a[median_index]` was not equal to the element at `(n - 1) / 2` in the sorted list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is empty, `results` is an empty list.**
