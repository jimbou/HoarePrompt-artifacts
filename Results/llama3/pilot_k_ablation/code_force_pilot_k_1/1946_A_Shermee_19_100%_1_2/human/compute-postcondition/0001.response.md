To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. Since `results` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to have at least 1 test case, and `case` should be the first test case in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
