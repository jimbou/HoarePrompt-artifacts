Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `results` is an empty list**

In this output state, the variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list, while the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged. The `test_cases` still contains a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
