To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_rep` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `_rep` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_rep` is 0**
