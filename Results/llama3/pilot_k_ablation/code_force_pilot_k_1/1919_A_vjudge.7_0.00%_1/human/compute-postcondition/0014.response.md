Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `n` is higher than `k`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, 'Alice' is being printed if `n` is strictly less than `k`, otherwise 'Bob' is being printed.***
