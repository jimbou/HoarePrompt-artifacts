Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, with each line containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are both between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
