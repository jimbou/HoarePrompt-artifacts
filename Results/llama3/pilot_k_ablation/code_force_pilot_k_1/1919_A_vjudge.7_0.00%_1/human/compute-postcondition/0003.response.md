Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9). The current value of `n` is higher than the current value of `k`.**
