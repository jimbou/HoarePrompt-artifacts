Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `n` is higher than the current value of `k`, and 'Bob' is being printed**
