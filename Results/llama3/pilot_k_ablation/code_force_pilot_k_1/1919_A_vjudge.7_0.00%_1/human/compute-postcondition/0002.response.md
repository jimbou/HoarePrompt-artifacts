Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still between 1 and 1000, but since one line has been read from stdin, the number of remaining lines is now `t-1`. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the two integers from the first line of stdin, which are between 1 and 10^9. The value of `_rep` remains 0, as it is not affected by the code.
