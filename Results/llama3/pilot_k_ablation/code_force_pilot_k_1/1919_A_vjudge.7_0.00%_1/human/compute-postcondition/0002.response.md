The code reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, the first line of input is read and assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are now integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `_rep` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) but it is decreased by 1 because one line of input has been read. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9)**
