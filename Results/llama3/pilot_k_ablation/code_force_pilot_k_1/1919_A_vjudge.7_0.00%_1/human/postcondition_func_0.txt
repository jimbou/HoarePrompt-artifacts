This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers a and b. It compares each pair of integers and prints 'Alice' if a is less than b, 'Bob' if a is greater than b, or 'Bob' if a is equal to b. The function continues this process until all input lines have been processed, resulting in t lines of output, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
