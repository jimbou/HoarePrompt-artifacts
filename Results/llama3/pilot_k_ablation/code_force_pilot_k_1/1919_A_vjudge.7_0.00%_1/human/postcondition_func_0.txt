This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two space-separated integers a and b. It then compares each pair of integers and prints 'Alice' if a is less than b, 'Bob' if a is greater than or equal to b. The function continues this process until all t lines have been processed, leaving stdin empty.
