Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by simply comparing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, she will win, because she can always swap wallets and then remove a coin, forcing Bob to have an empty wallet on his turn. If Alice has more coins than Bob, or if they have the same number of coins, Bob will win, because he can always choose not to swap wallets and then remove a coin, forcing Alice to have an empty wallet on her turn.

The program correctly implements this logic by printing 'Alice' if n is less than k, and 'Bob' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
