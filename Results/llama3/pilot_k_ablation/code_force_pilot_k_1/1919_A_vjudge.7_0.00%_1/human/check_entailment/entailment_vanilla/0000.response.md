Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by comparing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. However, the program's logic is incorrect.

The program prints "Bob" when Alice has more coins (n > k), which is incorrect. According to the problem description, Alice will win if she has more coins because she can always make a move by exchanging wallets and removing a coin.

Similarly, the program prints "Alice" when Bob has more coins (n < k), which is also incorrect. Bob will win if he has more coins because he can always make a move by exchanging wallets and removing a coin.

The program prints "Bob" when the number of coins is equal (n == k), which is correct. In this case, Bob will win because Alice will be unable to make a move after Bob's turn.

However, the program's overall logic is flawed, and it does not correctly determine the winner in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
