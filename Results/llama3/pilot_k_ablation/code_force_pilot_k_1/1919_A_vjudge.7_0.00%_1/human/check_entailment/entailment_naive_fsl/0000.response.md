Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The game's outcome depends on the sum of the coins in both wallets, not just the comparison of the number of coins in each wallet.

For example, if Alice has 3 coins and Bob has 4 coins, the program will print "Alice" because n < k. However, the correct outcome of the game is that Bob will win, because the sum of the coins in both wallets is 7, which is an odd number. In this case, Bob will make the last move and win the game.

The correct solution should check if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd or even. If the sum is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.
