Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Alice will win, and if it is odd, Bob will win.

The program does not take into account the total number of coins, but instead only compares the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

For example, if Alice has 3 coins and Bob has 2 coins, the program will print "Alice", but the correct answer is "Bob" because the total number of coins is 5, which is odd.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (n + k) % 2 == 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This program correctly determines the winner of the game by checking the parity of the total number of coins.
