Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, and the game is played optimally. However, the program does not take into account the optimal moves of the players. It simply compares the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and prints the winner based on that.

The correct approach would be to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who removes the last coin will win. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will remove the last coin, and if it's even, Bob will remove the last coin.

Correctness: **False**
