To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that must be met for the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while que:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `que` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop, `que` is either a deque containing the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph or a deque containing -1 if no cycle is found. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `que` must not be empty.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `que` is not empty. This means `que` must contain at least one element, which is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph.

State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is an empty list, i is -1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, start is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, end is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, que is a deque containing at least one element (the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph), and prev is a dictionary with the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph mapped to -1.**
