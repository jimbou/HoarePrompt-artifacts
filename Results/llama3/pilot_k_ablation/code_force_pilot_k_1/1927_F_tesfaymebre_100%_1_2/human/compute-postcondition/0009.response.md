Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is a sorted list of at least one edge in descending order, each edge represented as a tuple of (weight, vertex1, vertex2), i is m-1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w is the weight of the first edge in the list, u is the first vertex of the first edge in the list, v is the second vertex of the first edge in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU. The parent of u and the parent of v in the DSU are not the same***
