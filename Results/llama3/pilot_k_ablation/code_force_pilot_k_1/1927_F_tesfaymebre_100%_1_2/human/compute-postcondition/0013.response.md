Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is an empty list, i is -1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, start is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, end is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, que is a deque containing the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, and prev is a dictionary with the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph mapped to -1. If no cycle is found, que is a deque containing -1 and prev is a dictionary with -1 mapped to -1.**

The code creates a deque `que` containing the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, which is stored in the variable `start`. If no cycle is found, `start` is -1, so `que` will contain -1. The code also creates a dictionary `prev` with the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph mapped to -1. If no cycle is found, `prev` will have -1 mapped to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
