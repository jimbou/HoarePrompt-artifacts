The code prints the vertices in the path from start to end in reverse order, excluding the last vertex (end), and the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph.
Output: **the vertices in the path from start to end in reverse order (excluding the last vertex (end)), and the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph (_min_edge)**
