Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is a sorted list of at least one edge in descending order, each edge represented as a tuple of (weight, vertex1, vertex2), i is m-1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements, _min_edge is the weight of the first edge in the list, start is the first vertex of the first edge in the list, end is the second vertex of the first edge in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU. The current value of parent_u is equal to the current value of parent_v.**

The code block assigns the weight of the first edge in the list to `_min_edge`, and the first and second vertices of the first edge to `start` and `end`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `dsu`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
