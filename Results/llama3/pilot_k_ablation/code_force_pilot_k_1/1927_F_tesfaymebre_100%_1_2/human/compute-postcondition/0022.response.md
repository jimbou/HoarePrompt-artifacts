Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges and has at least 1 neighbor for the current `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `start` is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `end` is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `que` is a deque containing at least one element (the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph) with one less element, `prev` is a dictionary with the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph mapped to -1, `node` is a node in the graph. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, then the current value of `node` is equal to `nei` and the current neighbor `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
