Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is a sorted list of at least one edge in descending order, each edge represented as a tuple of (weight, vertex1, vertex2), i is m-1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w is the weight of the first edge in the list, u is the first vertex of the first edge in the list, v is the second vertex of the first edge in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning the result of the `dsu.find()` method to a variable. The `dsu.find()` method returns the parent of a given vertex in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure. The DSU object `dsu` has `n+1` elements, where `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= m`.

The first line assigns the parent of vertex `u` to the variable `parent_u`. Since `u` is the first vertex of the first edge in the list, its parent is determined by the DSU.

The second line assigns the parent of vertex `v` to the variable `parent_v`. Since `v` is the second vertex of the first edge in the list, its parent is also determined by the DSU.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. The graph, edges, and other variables maintain their initial state.
