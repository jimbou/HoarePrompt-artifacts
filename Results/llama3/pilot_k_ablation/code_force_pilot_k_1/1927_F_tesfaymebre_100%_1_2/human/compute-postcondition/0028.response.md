Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is an empty list, i is -1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, start is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, end is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary mapping each vertex reachable from start (excluding end) to its previous vertex in the path from start to end (if a cycle was found), or prev is a dictionary with -1 mapped to -1 (if no cycle was found), node is end, path is an empty list, curr is end.**

The code initializes an empty list `path` and assigns the value of `end` to `curr`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
