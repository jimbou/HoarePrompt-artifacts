To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `curr != -1`. The only variable in the loop head is `curr`, so we can only adjust its state.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `curr`. If `curr` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `curr` is `end`, which is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph.

However, we cannot guarantee that `end` is not equal to -1 based on the given state. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `curr` (or `end`) to ensure it is not equal to -1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, `edges` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `start` is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `end` must not be -1, `que` is an empty deque, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each vertex reachable from start (excluding end) to its previous vertex in the path from start to end (if a cycle was found), or prev is a dictionary with -1 mapped to -1 (if no cycle was found), `node` is end, `path` is an empty list, `curr` must not be -1**
