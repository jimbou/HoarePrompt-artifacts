Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is a sorted list of at least one edge in descending order, each edge represented as a tuple of (weight, vertex1, vertex2), i is m-1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements. If the parent of u and the parent of v in the DSU are the same, then the weight of the first edge in the list is stored in _min_edge, the first vertex of the first edge in the list is stored in start, and the second vertex of the first edge in the list is stored in end. Otherwise, the parent of u and the parent of v in the DSU are the same, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.***
