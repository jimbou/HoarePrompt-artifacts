You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes 1 time. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a non negative integer, `fac` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    fac *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `fac` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**

Your Task:

Initial State: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, edges is an empty list, i is -1, u and v are the last two vertices added to the graph, w is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, dsu is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, start is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, end is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, que is a deque containing the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, and prev is a dictionary with the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph mapped to -1. If no cycle is found, que is a deque containing -1 and prev is a dictionary with -1 mapped to -1.
Code of the loop:
```
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, `edges` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `start` is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `end` is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `que` is a deque containing all vertices reachable from `start` that are not `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each vertex reachable from `start` (excluding `end`) to its previous vertex in the path from `start`, `node` is a node in the graph.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
