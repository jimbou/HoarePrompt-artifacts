The code prints the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, which is stored in the variable `_min_edge`, and the length of the path from the start vertex to the end vertex, which is stored in the variable `path`.

Since the exact values of `_min_edge` and `path` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph and the length of the path from the start vertex to the end vertex.

Output: **_min_edge (the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph), len(path) (the length of the path from the start vertex to the end vertex)**
