Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, `edges` is a sorted list of at least one edge in descending order, each edge represented as a tuple of (weight, vertex1, vertex2), `i` is m-1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements where the parent of `u` and the parent of `v` are the same, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `w` is the weight of the first edge in the list, `u` is the first vertex of the first edge in the list, `v` is the second vertex of the first edge in the list, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the DSU which is also the parent of `v` in the DSU.**

In this output state, the DSU object `dsu` now has `u` and `v` in the same set, meaning their parents are the same. All other variables remain unchanged.
