Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, `edges` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `start` is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `end` is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `que` is a deque containing all vertices reachable from `start` that are not `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each vertex reachable from `start` (excluding `end`) to its previous vertex in the path from `start`, `node` is a node in the graph.**
