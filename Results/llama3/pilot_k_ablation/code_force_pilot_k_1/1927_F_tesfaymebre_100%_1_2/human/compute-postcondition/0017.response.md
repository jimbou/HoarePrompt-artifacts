Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, `edges` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `start` is the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `end` is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, `que` is a deque containing at least one element (the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph) with one less element, `prev` is a dictionary with the first vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph mapped to -1, and the current value of `node` is equal to the current value of `end`, which is the second vertex of the first edge that caused a cycle in the graph, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program execution is paused at the point where the break statement is encountered.
