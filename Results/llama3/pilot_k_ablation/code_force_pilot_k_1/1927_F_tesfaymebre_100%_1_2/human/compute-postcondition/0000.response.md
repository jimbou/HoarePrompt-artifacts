Output State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`, which is unknown.**

The value of `test_cases` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1()`. Since the return value of `func_1()` is unknown, the exact value of `test_cases` cannot be determined. The fact that `test_cases` was initially a positive integer is no longer relevant, as its value has been overwritten by the return value of `func_1()`.
