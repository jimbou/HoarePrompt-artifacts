Output State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()` that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only calls the function `func_6()` without modifying these variables. The function `func_6()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified, so we cannot determine any changes to the state beyond the execution of this function.
