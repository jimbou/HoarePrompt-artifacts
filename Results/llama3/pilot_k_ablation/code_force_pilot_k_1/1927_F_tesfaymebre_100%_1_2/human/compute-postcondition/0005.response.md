To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `edges`, `w`, `u`, and `v`. 

For the loop to execute, `edges` must have at least one edge. Since `edges` is a sorted list of `m` edges in descending order, we can adjust the state of `edges` to have at least one edge. 

The loop will start with the first edge in the sorted list, so we can adjust the states of `w`, `u`, and `v` to be the weight and vertices of the first edge in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected and weighted graph with m edges, `edges` is a sorted list of at least one edge in descending order, each edge represented as a tuple of (weight, vertex1, vertex2), `i` is m-1, `u` and `v` are the last two vertices added to the graph, `w` is the weight of the last edge added to the graph, `dsu` is a DSU object with n+1 elements, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `w` is the weight of the first edge in the list, `u` is the first vertex of the first edge in the list, `v` is the second vertex of the first edge in the list**
