n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The function func_3() returns a tuple of two integers. The function func_3() returns a tuple of three integers. The class DSU is defined and has methods find() and union(). The graph is undirected and weighted, and there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices. The graph does not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself).
