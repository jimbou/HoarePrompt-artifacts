This function constructs an undirected and weighted graph with a specified number of vertices and edges, detects the first edge that causes a cycle in the graph, and prints the weight of this edge and the length of the path from the start vertex to the end vertex. If a cycle is found, it also prints the vertices in the path from the start vertex to the end vertex. If no cycle is found, it prints the weight of the first edge that would cause a cycle (positive infinity) and the length of the path (which is undefined in this case).
