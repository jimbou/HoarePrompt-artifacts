This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers in descending order, calculates a series of sums by subtracting pairs of integers from the total sum, and prints the maximum sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and all variables undefined.
