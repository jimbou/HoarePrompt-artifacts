Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is a positive integer, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, sum1 is a positive integer, ans is a list containing the value of sums, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is not equal to 0, and the sum of i, x, and -1 is less than n, sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The first line updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
