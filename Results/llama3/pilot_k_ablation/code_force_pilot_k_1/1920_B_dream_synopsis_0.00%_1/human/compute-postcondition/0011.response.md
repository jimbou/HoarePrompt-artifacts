Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is a positive integer, `stdin` is empty, and `_` is 0. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`. If the sum of `i`, `x`, and -1 is less than `n`, `sums` is the updated value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]`.***
