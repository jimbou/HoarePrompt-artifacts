Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains one less test case than initially, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` contains the updated sums after the code execution. Otherwise, `ans` contains the updated sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.***
