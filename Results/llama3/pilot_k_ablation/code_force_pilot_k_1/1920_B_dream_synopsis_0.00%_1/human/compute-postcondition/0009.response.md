Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is a positive integer, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, sum1 is a positive integer, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is a positive integer equal to its original value plus a[i - 1].**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line adds the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`, updating the value of `sums`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
