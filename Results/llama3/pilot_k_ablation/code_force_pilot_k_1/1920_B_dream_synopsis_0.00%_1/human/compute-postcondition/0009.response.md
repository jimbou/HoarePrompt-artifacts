Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is at least 0, x is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated sum of the integers in a up to index i-1, _ is 0, stdin contains one less test case than initially, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is not less than n, sums is the updated sum of the integers in a up to index i-1**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated to include the integer at index `i-1` in list `a`. The value of `ans` has also been updated to include this new sum. All other variables remain unchanged.
