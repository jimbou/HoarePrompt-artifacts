Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n`, `k`, and `x` are positive integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is a positive integer, `ans` is a list of integers, and `_` is the number of test cases. The value of `ans` is a list containing `k+1` elements, where each element is the updated value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and the maximum value in the list `ans` has been printed for each test case. If there are no test cases, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans` are not defined.**
