The code snippet provided reads input for two test cases, sorts the input list in descending order, and calculates the sum of the sorted list. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. Since `input()` must be greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are all positive integers. Stdin now contains one less test case.
*   The second line reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to `a`. Stdin now contains one less test case.
*   The third line sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
*   The fourth line reverses the sorted list `a`, making it sorted in descending order.
*   The fifth line calculates the sum of all elements in the sorted list `a` and assigns it to `sum1`.
*   The sixth line initializes an empty list `ans`.

Considering the initial state and the combined effect of all lines, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains one less test case than initially**
