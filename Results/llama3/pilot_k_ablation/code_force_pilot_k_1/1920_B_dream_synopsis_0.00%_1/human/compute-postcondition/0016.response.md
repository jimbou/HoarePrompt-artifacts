Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers in descending order, calculates a series of sums by subtracting multiples of the xth largest integer from the total sum, and prints the maximum sum for each test case. If there are no test cases, the function does not perform any actions.**
