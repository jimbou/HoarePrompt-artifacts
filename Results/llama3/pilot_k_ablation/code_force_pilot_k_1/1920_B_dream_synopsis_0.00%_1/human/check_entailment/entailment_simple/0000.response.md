Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the array `a`.
2.  The program sorts the array `a` in descending order, which is necessary to determine the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
3.  The program calculates the sum of all elements in the array `a` and stores it in the variable `sum1`.
4.  The program then iterates over the range `k + 1` to consider all possible scenarios where Alice removes `i` elements from the array. For each scenario, it calculates the sum of the remaining elements after Bob's move.
5.  The program uses a clever approach to calculate the sum of the remaining elements after Bob's move. It starts with the sum of all elements (`sum1`) and then subtracts twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements (since Bob will multiply these elements by -1). This gives the sum of the remaining elements after Bob's move.
6.  The program then updates the sum for each subsequent scenario by adding the `i-1`th element (which was removed by Alice) and subtracting twice the `i + x - 1`th element (which is the next element that Bob will multiply by -1).
7.  The program stores the maximum sum obtained from all scenarios in the list `ans`.
8.  Finally, the program prints the maximum sum from the list `ans`, which represents the optimal sum of elements after the game.

Correctness: **True**
