The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains three integers n, k, and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.
