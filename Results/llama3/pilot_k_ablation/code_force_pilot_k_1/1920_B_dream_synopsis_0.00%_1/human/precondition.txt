The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n), representing the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements that Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), representing the elements of the array.
