Reasoning: 

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes an integer input n and checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it generates a string of letters from 'A' to 'Z', repeating each letter twice, with the last letter possibly repeated only once if n is odd. This string is designed to have exactly n special characters.

func_2 reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then executes func_1 t times.

The execution summaries of the functions indicate that func_1 correctly generates a string with exactly n special characters when n is greater than 1. func_2 correctly reads the number of test cases and executes func_1 the appropriate number of times.

Therefore, the given program meets the problem description, and its functions together produce the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
