Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: 'n' is 0, 'res' is a string consisting of a sequence of letters from 'A' to 'Z' repeated twice, with the last letter possibly repeated only once if the initial value of 'n' is odd, 'i' is equal to the initial value of 'n'
        print(res)
        #This is printed: A sequence of letters from 'A' to 'Z' repeated twice
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains one input: an integer. If the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'res' is a string consisting of a sequence of letters from 'A' to 'Z' repeated twice, with the last letter possibly repeated only once if the initial value of 'n' is odd, 'i' is equal to the initial value of 'n', and the string 'res' is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer input from the user, checks if it's less than or equal to 1, and prints 'NO' in that case. If the input is greater than 1, it generates a string of letters from 'A' to 'Z', repeating each letter twice, with the last letter possibly repeated only once if the input is odd, and prints this string. The function effectively validates the input and produces a specific output based on the input value, either a simple 'NO' or a constructed string of repeated letters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and then t number of integers, each integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` number of integers, each integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t number of integers, and executes the function func_1() t times.
