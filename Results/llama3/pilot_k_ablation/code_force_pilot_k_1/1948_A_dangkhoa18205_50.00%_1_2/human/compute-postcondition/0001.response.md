The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` number of integers, each integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), so for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` number of integers, each integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
