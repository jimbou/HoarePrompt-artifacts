Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains one input: an integer. If the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'res' is a string consisting of a sequence of letters from 'A' to 'Z' repeated twice, with the last letter possibly repeated only once if the initial value of 'n' is odd, 'i' is equal to the initial value of 'n', and the string 'res' is being printed.***
