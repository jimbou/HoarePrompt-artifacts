Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` number of integers, each integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, stdin, `_`, and the constraint that `t` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but since its implementation is not provided, its effects on the program state are unknown.
