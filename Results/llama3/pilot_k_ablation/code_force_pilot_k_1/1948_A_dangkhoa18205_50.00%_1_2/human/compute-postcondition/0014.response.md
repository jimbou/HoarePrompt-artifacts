Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 1 and less than or equal to 50, 'YES' is being printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1. If `n` is larger than 1 and less than or equal to 48, `res` is 'AA'. If `n` is 1, `res` is 'A'.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The conditions for `res` are still valid, so if `n` is larger than 1 and less than or equal to 48, `res` is 'AA', and if `n` is 1, `res` is 'A'.
