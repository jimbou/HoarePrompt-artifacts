According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer larger than 1 and less than or equal to 50. This already ensures that `n` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1 and less than or equal to 50, stdin contains one input: an integer, 'YES' is being printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 0, res is an empty string**
