Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `balance` is -1, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `s` and `char` is not equal to '('**

The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, the new value of `balance` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
