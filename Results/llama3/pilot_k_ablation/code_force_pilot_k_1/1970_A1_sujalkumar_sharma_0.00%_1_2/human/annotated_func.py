#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `balance` is 0, `positions` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the balance of the parentheses at each position `i` in the string `s`, the position `i` itself, and the character at that position `i`.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters from s, sorted by the balance of the parentheses at each position and then by the position in descending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string of balanced parentheses and returns a new string consisting of the same characters, sorted by the balance of the parentheses at each position and then by the position in descending order. The function does not modify the input string.
