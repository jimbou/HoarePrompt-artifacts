Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it prints 'YES'.

2. If the array is not sorted, it checks for the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order (i.e., the current element is greater than the next element).

3. Once it finds such a pair, it checks two conditions:
   - If the first element of the array is greater than all elements in the suffix (new), and 
   - If the suffix (new) is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix. If not, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
