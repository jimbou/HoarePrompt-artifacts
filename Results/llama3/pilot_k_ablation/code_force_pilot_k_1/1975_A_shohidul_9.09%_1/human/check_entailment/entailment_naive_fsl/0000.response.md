Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping the prefix and suffix.

However, if the input is:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping the prefix and suffix.

But if the input is:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping the prefix and suffix.

But if the input is:

But if the input is:
