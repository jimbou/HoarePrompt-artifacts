Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation any number of times.

However, the program will output "NO" for this case, but it will not work correctly for the case where the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation. For example, consider the input:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the array is already sorted or if the first element is greater than the rest of the elements. It does not check all possible cases where the array can be sorted after performing the operation.

To fix this issue, the program needs to check all possible cases where the array can be sorted after performing the operation. This can be done by iterating over all possible split points and checking if the resulting array is sorted.

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(n):
            new = a[i:] + a[:i]
            if all([new[j] <= new[j+1] for j in range(n-1)]):
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

This program checks all possible cases where the array can be sorted after performing the operation and outputs "YES" if it finds a case where the array is sorted, otherwise it outputs "NO".
