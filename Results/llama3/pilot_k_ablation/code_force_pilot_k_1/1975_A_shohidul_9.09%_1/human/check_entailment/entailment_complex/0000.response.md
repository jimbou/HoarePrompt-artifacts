Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. 

The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the program prints 'YES'. If the array is not sorted, the program checks if the array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts at each possible position and checking if the resulting array is sorted. If the array can be sorted, the program prints 'YES'. If the array cannot be sorted, the program prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and does not contain any syntax or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
