Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.**
