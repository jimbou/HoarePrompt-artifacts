To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `_` to 0, as it will take on the value of the current iteration starting from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), `_` is 0**
