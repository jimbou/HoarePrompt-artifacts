Output State: **t is a positive integer that is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer that is at least 1. The variable `n` now holds an integer value read from the input. The list `a` contains `n` integers, also read from the input. The variable `check_all` is a boolean value that indicates whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order. If all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `check_all` is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`.
