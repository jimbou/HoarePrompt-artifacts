Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in `a[i:]` are less than `a[0]`, `new` is a list of `n-i` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6), `new_all` is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in `new` are in increasing order, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `new`, `new_all`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 1, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is still greater than the current value of `a[i]`. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
