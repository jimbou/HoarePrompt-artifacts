Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that is at least 1, n is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is False, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, new_all is True. If both check_all and new_all are True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
