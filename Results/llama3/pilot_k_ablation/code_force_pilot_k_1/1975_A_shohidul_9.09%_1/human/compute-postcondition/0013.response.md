Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is True, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of `n - 1` integers, `new_all` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The program still prints 'YES' as it was doing before the break statement.
