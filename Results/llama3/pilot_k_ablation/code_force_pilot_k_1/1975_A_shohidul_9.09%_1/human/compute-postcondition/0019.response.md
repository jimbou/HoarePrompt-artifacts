Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that is at least 1, n is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is False, i is 1. If the value at index i - 1 in list a is greater than the value at index i, then a new list new of n - 1 integers is created, new_all is set to True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited based on the values of check_all and new_all. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
