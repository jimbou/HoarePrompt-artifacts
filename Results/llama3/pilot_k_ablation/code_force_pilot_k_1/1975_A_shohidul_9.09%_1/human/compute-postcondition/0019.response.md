Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). If check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, check_all is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in a[i:] are less than a[0], new is a list of n-i integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), new_all is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in new are in increasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
