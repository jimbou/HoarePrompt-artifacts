Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6). If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then if `check_all` and `new_all` are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in `a[i:]` are less than `a[0]`, `new` is a list of `n-i` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6), `new_all` is a boolean value indicating that not all elements in `new` are in increasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.**
