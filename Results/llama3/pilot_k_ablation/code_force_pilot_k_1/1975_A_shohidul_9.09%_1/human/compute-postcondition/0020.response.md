Output State: **t is a positive integer that is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is False, i is n - 1. If the list a is sorted in ascending order, then no changes are made to the variables. If the list a is not sorted in ascending order, then either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited based on the values of check_all and new_all.**
