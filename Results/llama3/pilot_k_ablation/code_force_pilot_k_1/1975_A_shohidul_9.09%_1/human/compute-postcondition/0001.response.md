The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The first integer is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
