To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, we can adjust its state to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1**
