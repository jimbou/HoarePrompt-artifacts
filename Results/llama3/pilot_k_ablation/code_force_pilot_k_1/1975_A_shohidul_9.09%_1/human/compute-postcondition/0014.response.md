Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean value indicating that all elements in a[i:] are less than a[0], new is a list of n-i integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), new_all is a boolean value indicating that all elements in new are in increasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1, and the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i], and 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, a, check_all, new, new_all, and _ remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases because we have already processed one test case and printed 'YES'. The value of i is still 1, and the current value of a[i - 1] is still greater than the current value of a[i]. Additionally, we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the break statement.
