Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), which is the range of values it can take based on the input. The list `a` is updated to contain `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), which are the values read from the input. The variable `check_all` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Finally, the state of `stdin` is updated to contain `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
