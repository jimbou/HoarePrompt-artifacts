Output State: **t is a positive integer that is at least 1, n is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is False, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, new_all is True, and either check_all is False or new_all is False, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, and new_all remain unchanged. The condition that either check_all is False or new_all is False still holds, and 'NO' is still being printed.
