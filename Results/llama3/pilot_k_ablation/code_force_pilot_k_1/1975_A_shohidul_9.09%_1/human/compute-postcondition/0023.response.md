Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (array length) followed by a list of integers (array elements). It checks if the array is sorted in ascending order. If the array is sorted, it prints 'YES'. If the array is not sorted, it checks if the array can be sorted by removing the first element and then printing 'YES' if the remaining array is sorted in ascending order, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.**
