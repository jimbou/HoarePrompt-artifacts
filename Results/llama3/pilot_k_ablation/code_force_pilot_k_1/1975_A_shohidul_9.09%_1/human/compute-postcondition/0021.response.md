Postcondition: **t is a positive integer that is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers. If check_all is True, indicating that the list a is sorted in ascending order, then 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then if the list a is sorted in ascending order, no changes are made to the variables. If the list a is not sorted in ascending order, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited based on the values of check_all and new_all.**
