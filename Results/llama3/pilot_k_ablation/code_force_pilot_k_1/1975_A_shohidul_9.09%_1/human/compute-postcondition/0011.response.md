Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean value indicating that all elements in a[i:] are less than a[0], new is a list of n-i integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), new_all is a boolean value indicating that all elements in new are in increasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, and the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i]. Additionally, both check_all and new_all are true, meaning all elements in a[i:] are less than a[0] and all elements in new are in increasing order.**
