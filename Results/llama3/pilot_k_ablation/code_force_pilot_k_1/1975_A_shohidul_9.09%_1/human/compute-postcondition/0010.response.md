Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean value indicating that all elements in a[i:] are less than a[0], new is a list of n-i integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), new_all is a boolean value indicating that all elements in new are in increasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, and the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i].**

The code snippet executes three lines, each affecting different variables. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` from index `i` to the end to the variable `new`. This creates a new list containing the last `n-i` elements of `a`. The second line assigns a boolean value to `check_all` based on the condition that all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`. This updates the value of `check_all` to reflect the relationship between the first element of `a` and the elements in `new`. The third line assigns a boolean value to `new_all` based on the condition that all elements in `new` are in increasing order. This updates the value of `new_all` to reflect the order of elements in `new`. The other variables, including `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
