Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It checks if the list is in increasing order, and if not, it checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is in decreasing order and the second part is in increasing order. The function prints 'YES' if the list meets either condition, and 'NO' otherwise.**
