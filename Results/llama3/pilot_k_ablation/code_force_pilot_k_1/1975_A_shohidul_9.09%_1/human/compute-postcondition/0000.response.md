Let's break down the code and its impact on the program.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

When the code `t = int(input())` is executed, it reads the first integer from the stdin, which is the number of test cases `t`. The value of `t` is now a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

The output state is:

**`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, and the standard input still contains the remaining test cases, each with two lines: the first line containing the number of integers in the test case, and the second line containing the actual integers.
