Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a list of integers (the elements of the array). The integer is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The list contains integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains one less test case, but each test case still contains two inputs: an integer (the length of the array) and a list of integers (the elements of the array). The integer is still a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the list still contains integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
