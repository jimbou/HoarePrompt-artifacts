Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a tree represented by an adjacency list, starting from a given vertex x. It removes a specified number of edges (y) from the tree and returns a tuple containing two values: the sum of the results of the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of x plus one, and the total number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which the DFS result is greater than or equal to the number of edges to be removed.
