This function determines the largest integer less than or equal to the integer division of `n` by `k` plus 1 for which a certain condition (`check(r)`) returns False, given a tree with `n` vertices and `k` as a non-negative integer less than `n`. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges, then performs a binary search to find the desired integer. The function prints this integer as output.
