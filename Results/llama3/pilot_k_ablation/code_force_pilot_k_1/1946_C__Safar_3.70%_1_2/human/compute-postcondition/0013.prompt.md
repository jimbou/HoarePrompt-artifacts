You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal, and the function is initially called with a vertex x and y as the number of edges to be removed.
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: x and y are positive integers, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal and contains x and all its neighbors, c is 1 plus the sum of the results of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x, r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which ans is greater than or equal to y.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the results of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x, and r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which ans is greater than or equal to y.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the results of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x, and r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which ans is greater than or equal to y.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
