Postcondition: ***x and y are positive integers, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal and contains x and possibly other nodes, c is 1 plus the result of the dfs function if node is not in visited, otherwise c is 1, r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus 1 if ans is greater than or equal to y and node is not in visited, otherwise r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search if node is not in visited, otherwise r is the original value of r, node is the first node in the list, ans is the result of the dfs function if node is not in visited, otherwise ans is not changed, rn is the number of nodes visited during the search if node is not in visited, otherwise rn is not changed.***
