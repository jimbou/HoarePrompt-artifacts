Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal and contains x and possibly other nodes, c is 1 plus the result of the dfs function, r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus 1 if ans is greater than or equal to y, otherwise r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search, node is the first node in the list, ans is the result of the dfs function, rn is the number of nodes visited during the search***
