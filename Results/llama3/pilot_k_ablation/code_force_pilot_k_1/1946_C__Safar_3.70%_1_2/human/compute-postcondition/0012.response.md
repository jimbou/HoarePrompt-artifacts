Functionality: This function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a tree represented by an adjacency list dictionary `g`, starting from a given vertex `x` and considering a specified number of edges to be removed `y`. It returns a tuple containing two values: `c` and `r`. The value `c` represents the count of nodes visited during the search, including the starting vertex `x`, plus the sum of the results of the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of `x`. The value `r` represents the total number of nodes visited during the search, including the starting vertex `x`, plus the number of unvisited neighbors of `x` for which the DFS function result is greater than or equal to `y`. The function modifies the `visited` set by adding the starting vertex `x` and its unvisited neighbors.
