Output State: **x and y are positive integers, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal and contains x and all its neighbors, c is 1 plus the sum of the results of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x, r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which ans is greater than or equal to y.**
