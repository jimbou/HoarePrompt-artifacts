Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), representing the edges of a tree with n vertices.
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices adjacent to vertex `i` in the tree represented by `edges`.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices adjacent to vertex `i` in the tree represented by `edges`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is the smallest integer greater than the integer division of `n` by `k` plus 1 for which `check(l)` returns True, `r` is the largest integer less than or equal to the integer division of `n` by `k` plus 1 for which `check(r)` returns False.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: the largest integer less than or equal to the integer division of `n` by `k` plus 1 for which `check(r)` returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the largest integer less than or equal to the integer division of `n` by `k` plus 1 for which a certain condition (`check(r)`) returns False, given a tree with `n` vertices and `k` as a non-negative integer less than `n`. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges, then performs a binary search to find the desired integer. The function prints this integer as output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal, and the function is initially called with a vertex x and y as the number of edges to be removed.
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: x and y are positive integers, g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, visited is a set of vertices that have been visited in the DFS traversal and contains x and all its neighbors, c is 1 plus the sum of the results of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x, r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which ans is greater than or equal to y.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the results of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x, and r is the original value of r plus the number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which ans is greater than or equal to y.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a tree represented by an adjacency list, starting from a given vertex x. It removes a specified number of edges (y) from the tree and returns a tuple containing two values: the sum of the results of the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of x plus one, and the total number of nodes visited during the search plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x for which the DFS result is greater than or equal to the number of edges to be removed.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is a set or list that keeps track of visited nodes, and dfs is a function that takes two parameters and returns a tuple of two values, where the first value is a boolean and the second value is an integer.
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: *x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is an empty set or list, ans is a boolean, and r is an integer. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k
    return False
    #The program returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. It takes a positive integer `x` and a non-negative integer `k` as inputs, and uses a DFS function to compute two values: a boolean `ans` and an integer `r`. The function returns `True` if both `ans` is greater than or equal to `x` and `r` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `False` otherwise. The function also clears a `visited` set or list before performing the DFS operation.
