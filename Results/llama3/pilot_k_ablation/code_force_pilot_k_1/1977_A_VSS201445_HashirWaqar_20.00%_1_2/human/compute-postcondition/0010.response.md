Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 0. If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is larger than or equal to `m`, 'YES' is being printed if both `n` and `m` are either odd or even.***
