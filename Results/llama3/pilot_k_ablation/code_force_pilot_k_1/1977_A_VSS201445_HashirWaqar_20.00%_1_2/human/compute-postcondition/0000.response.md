The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the input from `stdin` contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). So for the loop to be executed the input from `stdin` must contain an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 0**
