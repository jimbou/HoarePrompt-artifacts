Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to the first pair of integers from the input, which are between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with two integers, since one pair has been read. The value of `_` remains 0, as it was not affected by the code.
