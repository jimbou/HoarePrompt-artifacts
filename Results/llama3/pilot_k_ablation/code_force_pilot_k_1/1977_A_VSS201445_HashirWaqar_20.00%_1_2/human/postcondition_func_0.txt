This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair consists of two numbers n and m. It then checks each pair and prints 'YES' if n is greater than or equal to m and both n and m are either both odd or both even, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all pairs have been read from standard input, at which point the input is empty.
