Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program checks each pair of numbers n and m, and prints 'YES' if n is greater than or equal to m and both n and m are either both odd or both even. This is because Nikita can only end up with a tower of m cubes if he makes an even number of moves (either adding or removing cubes) when m is even, or an odd number of moves when m is odd.

The program correctly handles the case where n is less than m by printing 'NO', because it is impossible for Nikita to end up with a tower of m cubes if he makes fewer moves than the number of cubes he wants to end up with.

The program also correctly handles the case where n is greater than or equal to m by printing 'YES' if both n and m are either both odd or both even, because Nikita can always make the required number of moves to end up with a tower of m cubes in this case.

Correctness: **True**
