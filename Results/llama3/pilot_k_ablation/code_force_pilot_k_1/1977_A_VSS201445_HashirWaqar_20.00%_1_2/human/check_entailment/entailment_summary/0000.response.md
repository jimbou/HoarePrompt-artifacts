Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program checks if n is greater than or equal to m, which is a necessary condition because Nikita can't build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves he makes. Then, it checks if both n and m are either both odd or both even. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 in each move. Therefore, if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even), it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
