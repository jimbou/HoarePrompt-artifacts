Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of n and m from the input.

The program first checks if n is less than m. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

If n is not less than m, the program checks whether both n and m are either odd or even. This is done using the bitwise AND operator (&) and the modulus operator (%). If both n and m are odd or both are even, the program prints 'YES' because it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for building a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The use of bitwise operations and modulus operations is also correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
