Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If n (the number of moves) is less than m (the desired number of cubes), it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

- If n and m are both odd or both even, it prints 'YES'. This is because if n is odd, the final number of cubes must also be odd (since each move changes the parity of the number of cubes), and if n is even, the final number of cubes must also be even.

This logic is correct because it covers all possible cases:

- If n < m, it's impossible to end up with m cubes.

- If n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even), it's possible to end up with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in each move.

- If n and m have different parity (one is odd and the other is even), it's impossible to end up with m cubes because the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move.

Therefore, the program correctly determines if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
