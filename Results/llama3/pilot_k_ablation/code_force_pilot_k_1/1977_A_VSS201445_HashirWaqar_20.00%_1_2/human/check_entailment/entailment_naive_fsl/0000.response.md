Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower must be either equal to the number of moves (if the number of moves is odd) or equal to the number of moves minus an even number (if the number of moves is even). The program checks these conditions using the bitwise AND operator (&) and the modulo operator (%). If the number of moves is odd, the program checks if the number of cubes is also odd (n & 1 and m & 1). If the number of moves is even, the program checks if the number of cubes is also even (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0). If either of these conditions is true, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO". The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge case where n < m, in which case it prints "NO".
