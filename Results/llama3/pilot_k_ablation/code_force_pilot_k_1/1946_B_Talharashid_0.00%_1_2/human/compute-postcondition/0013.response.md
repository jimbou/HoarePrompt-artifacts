Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the maximum sum of a subarray of the input integers, the sum of all input integers, and the values of n and k. The calculated value is then printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
