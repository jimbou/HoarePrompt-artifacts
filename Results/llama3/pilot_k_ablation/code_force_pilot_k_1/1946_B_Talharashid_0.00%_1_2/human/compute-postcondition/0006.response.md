Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list, `c` is equal to the sum of the original value of `c` and `ele`, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele` is no longer valid, instead either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and the first element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele` is no longer valid, instead, the condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than or equal to the absolute value of `ele` is true.
