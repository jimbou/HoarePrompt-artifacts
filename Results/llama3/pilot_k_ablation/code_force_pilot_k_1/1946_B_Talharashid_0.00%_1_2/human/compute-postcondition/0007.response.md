Postcondition: ***stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then c is 0 and maxi is 0. Otherwise, c is equal to the sum of the original value of c and ele, maxi is 0. Either ele is not less than 0 or c is more than or equal to the absolute value of ele.***
