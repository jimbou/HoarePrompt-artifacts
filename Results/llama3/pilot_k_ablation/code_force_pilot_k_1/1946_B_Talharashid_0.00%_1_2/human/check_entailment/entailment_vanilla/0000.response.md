Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by finding the maximum sum of the array after k operations. However, the approach used is incorrect.

The program is trying to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then multiply it by 2^k to account for the k operations. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the fact that the sum of the subarray can be inserted anywhere in the array, not just at the end.

Moreover, the program is using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` to calculate the final sum, which is incorrect. The correct formula should take into account the fact that the sum of the subarray can be inserted multiple times, not just twice.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum of the array after each operation. However, the given program does not use dynamic programming and instead uses a simple iterative approach that does not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
