Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve by breaking up the problem of difficulty x into a problemset of n sub-problems.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases and the values of x and n for each test case.

2. The program calculates the maximum possible balance by iterating over all possible divisors of x. It checks if each divisor is less than or equal to the integer division of x by n (k), and updates the maximum balance (ans) accordingly.

3. The program correctly handles the case where x is a perfect square, by checking both the divisor and the quotient of x.

4. The program prints the maximum balance for each test case, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

5. The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the standard input empty after execution.

Correctness: **True**
