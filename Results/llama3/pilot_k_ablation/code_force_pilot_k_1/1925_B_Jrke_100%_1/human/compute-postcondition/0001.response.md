The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line reads two integers, x and n, from the input and assigns them to the variables x and n, respectively. The second line calculates the integer division of x by n and assigns the result to the variable k. The third line initializes the variable ans to 1.

After the execution of the entire code block, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x)**

In this output state, the values of x and n are updated based on the input provided. The value of k is calculated based on the values of x and n. The variable ans is initialized to 1. The stdin is updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed.
