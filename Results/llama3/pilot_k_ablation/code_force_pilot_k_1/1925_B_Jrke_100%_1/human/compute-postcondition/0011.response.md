Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is the maximum value in the list `l`, the current value of `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` still contains the same elements as before, but the value of `ans` is now the maximum of these elements. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
