Functionality: **This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is the number of test cases (t), followed by t pairs of integers (x and n). For each pair, it calculates the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the integer division of x by n (k), and prints this value. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value, leaving stdin empty after execution.**
