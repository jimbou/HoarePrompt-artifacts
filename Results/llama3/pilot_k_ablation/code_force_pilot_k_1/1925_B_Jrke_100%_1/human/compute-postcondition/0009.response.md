Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, the current value of `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to include the integer division of `x` by `i`, in addition to the previous values of `ans` and the current value of `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
