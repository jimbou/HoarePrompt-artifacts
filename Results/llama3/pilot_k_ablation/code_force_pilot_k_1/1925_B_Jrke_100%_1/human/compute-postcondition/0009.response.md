Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1, and the integer division of `x` by `i`, stdin contains no input. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1, and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `x` is divisible by `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k` is still valid.
