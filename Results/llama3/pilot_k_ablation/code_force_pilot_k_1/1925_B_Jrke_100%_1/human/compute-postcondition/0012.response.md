Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is the maximum value in the list `l`, the current value of `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.***
