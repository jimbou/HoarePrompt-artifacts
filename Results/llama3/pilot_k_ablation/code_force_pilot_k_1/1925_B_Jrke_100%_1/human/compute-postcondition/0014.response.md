The code prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k (where k is the integer division of x by n)**
