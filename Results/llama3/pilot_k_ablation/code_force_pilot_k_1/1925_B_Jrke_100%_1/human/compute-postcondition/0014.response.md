The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. Since `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, it represents the largest integer less than or equal to `x/n`. The maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` is the largest integer that divides `x` without leaving a remainder and is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k (where k is the integer division of x by n)**
