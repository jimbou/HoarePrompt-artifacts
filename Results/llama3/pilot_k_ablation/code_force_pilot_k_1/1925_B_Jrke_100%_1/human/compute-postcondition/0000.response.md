To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `input()` reads from `stdin`, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure it contains a non-zero integer.

State: **`stdin` contains a non-zero integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), `_` is 0**
