To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. Since `x` is already an integer between 1 and 10^8, we don't need to adjust its range. However, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and x, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), `i` is 1**
