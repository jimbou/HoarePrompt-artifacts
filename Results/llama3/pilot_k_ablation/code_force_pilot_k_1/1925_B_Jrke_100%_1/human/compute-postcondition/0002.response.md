The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If x is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, stdin contains no input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, stdin contains no input**
