Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, stdin contains no input. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`**

In this output state, we have updated the value of `l` which is now a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is still 1. The stdin still contains no input. Also, the current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`.
