Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `l` now contains the value of `ans`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, which is 1.
