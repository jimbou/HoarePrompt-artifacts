Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, stdin contains no input. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.***
