Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and the current value of `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains two elements: the initial value of `ans` (which is 1) and the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, each with two integers `x` and `n`. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, and `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
