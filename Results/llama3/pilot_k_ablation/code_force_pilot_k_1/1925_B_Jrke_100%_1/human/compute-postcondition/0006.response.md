Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1, stdin contains no input. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`**

The code `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `l`. Since `i` is 1, the list `l` now contains two values: 1 and 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
