The function evaluates a list of password test cases and returns a list of strings indicating whether each password meets certain conditions. The conditions are that the letters and digits in the password must be sorted in ascending order, and if both letters and digits are present, the last letter must come before the first digit. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, where each string corresponds to the password at the same index in the input list. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
