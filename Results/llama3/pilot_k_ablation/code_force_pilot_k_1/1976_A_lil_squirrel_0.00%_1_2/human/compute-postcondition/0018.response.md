Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of exactly `n` characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of exactly `n` characters, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetical characters of `password`, `digits` is a string containing all the digits of `password`. If `password` is empty, `letters` and `digits` are empty strings. Either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the last character of `letters` is not after the first character of `digits` in `password`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `results` has been updated to include 'YES', indicating that the password meets the condition of having its letters and digits in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `test_cases` being a list of lists with at least one sublist, `n` being a positive integer, `password` being a string of exactly `n` characters, and `letters` and `digits` being strings containing the alphabetical and digit characters of `password`, respectively.
