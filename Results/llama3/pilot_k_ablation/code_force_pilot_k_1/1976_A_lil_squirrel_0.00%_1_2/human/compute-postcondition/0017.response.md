Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of exactly `n` characters, `results` is a list. If the letters or digits in `password` are not in ascending order, `results` contains 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` remains empty. `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of exactly `n` characters, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetical characters of `password`, `digits` is a string containing all the digits of `password`. If `password` is empty, `letters` and `digits` are empty strings. Either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the last character of `letters` is not after the first character of `digits` in `password`.***
