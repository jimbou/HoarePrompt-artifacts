Output State: **The program returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the corresponding password in `test_cases` meets the conditions specified in the loop. The list has the same length as `test_cases`, and each string in the list corresponds to the password at the same index in `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is empty, the returned list is also empty.**
