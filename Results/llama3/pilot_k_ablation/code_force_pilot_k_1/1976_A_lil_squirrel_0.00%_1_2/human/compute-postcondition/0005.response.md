The code `letters += ch` adds the current character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `ch` is the first character in the `password` and is an alphabetical character, `letters` now contains this first alphabetical character.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of exactly `n` characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of exactly `n` characters, `letters` is a string containing the first alphabetical character of `password`, `digits` is an empty string, and `ch` is the first character in the `password` and is an alphabetical character.**
