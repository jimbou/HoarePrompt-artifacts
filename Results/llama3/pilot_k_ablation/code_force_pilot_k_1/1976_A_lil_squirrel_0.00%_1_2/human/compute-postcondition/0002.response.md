Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a string password of exactly n characters, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, password is a string of exactly n characters, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each initializing an empty string variable: `letters` and `digits`. These lines do not affect any of the pre-existing variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `password`) or their values. The only change is the introduction of two new variables, `letters` and `digits`, both of which are empty strings.
