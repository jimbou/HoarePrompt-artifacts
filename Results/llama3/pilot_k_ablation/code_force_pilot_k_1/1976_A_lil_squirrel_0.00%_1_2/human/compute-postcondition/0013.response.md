Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a string password of exactly n characters, results is a list containing 'NO', n is a positive integer, password is a string of exactly n characters, letters is a string containing all the alphabetical characters of password, digits is a string containing all the digits of password. If password is empty, letters and digits are empty strings. The current value of letters is not in ascending order or the current value of digits is not in ascending order.**

The code snippet appends 'NO' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration, without modifying any other variables. The values of t, test_cases, n, password, letters, and digits remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of 'NO' to the results list.
