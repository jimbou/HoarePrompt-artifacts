Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `s`, such that 1 <= `n` <= 20 and `s` is a string of exactly `n` characters, each of which is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the corresponding password in `test_cases` meets the conditions specified in the loop. If `test_cases` is empty, `results` is also empty.**
