To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `password`, and `test_cases`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `test_cases` must have at least one sublist for the loop to execute. If it's empty, the loop will not run.
2. Since `n` and `password` are unpacked from each sublist in `test_cases`, we need to ensure that each sublist contains exactly two elements.
3. The first element of each sublist, `n`, must be a positive integer, and the second element, `password`, must be a string.

Considering these conditions, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of exactly `n` characters, and `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of exactly `n` characters**

Note that we didn't change the state of `t` or `results` since they are not part of the loop head.
