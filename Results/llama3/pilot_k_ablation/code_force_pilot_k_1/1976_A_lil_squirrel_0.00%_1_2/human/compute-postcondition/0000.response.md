The code initializes an empty list called `results`. The initial state's variables `t` and `test_cases` are not affected by this code. The output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `s`, such that 1 <= `n` <= 20 and `s` is a string of exactly `n` characters, each of which is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a string `s`, such that 1 <= `n` <= 20 and `s` is a string of exactly `n` characters, each of which is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `results` is an empty list.**
