Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem description. It first separates the letters and digits from the password, then checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order. It also checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO', otherwise it returns 'YES'.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles passwords with repeated letters or digits.

The use of the `isalpha()` and `isdigit()` methods to check if a character is a letter or a digit is correct, and the use of the `sorted()` function to check if the letters and digits are sorted is also correct.

The program also correctly handles the case where the password has a digit that comes after a letter, by checking if the index of the last letter is greater than the index of the first digit.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
