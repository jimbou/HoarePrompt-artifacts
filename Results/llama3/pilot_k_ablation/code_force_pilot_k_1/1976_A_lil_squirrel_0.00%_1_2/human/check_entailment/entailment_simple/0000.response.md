Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem statement.

1. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isalpha()` and `isdigit()` methods.

2. It checks if there are no digits after letters by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit in the password. If the last letter comes after the first digit, it returns 'NO'.

3. It checks if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the sorted digits with the original digits.

4. It checks if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the sorted letters with the original letters.

If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
