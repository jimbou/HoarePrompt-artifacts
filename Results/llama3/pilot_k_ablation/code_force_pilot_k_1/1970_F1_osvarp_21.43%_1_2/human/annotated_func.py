    #State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two integers where each integer represents the total points scored by each team, `t` is an integer, and stdin is empty. The state of `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `points` is updated based on the commands executed in the loop. If a player catches the golden snitch, the corresponding team's points are updated and a message is printed. If a player is eliminated, a message is printed. If a goal is scored, the corresponding team's points are updated and a message is printed.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the total points scored by each team)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a game where players move around a grid, score goals, and catch the golden snitch. It reads input from stdin, including the grid size, grid layout, player positions, and commands to move players or catch the snitch. The function updates the game state based on the commands, prints messages for goals, eliminations, and snitch catches, and finally prints the final score. The game state includes the positions of all players, the points scored by each team, and the status of the golden snitch.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a position on the field, and goal is a list of two lists, each containing positions of goals for the red and blue teams respectively.
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res', which indicates whether the position 'pos' is a goal for the red team (0), the blue team (1), or not a goal for either team (-1).

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given position is a goal for the red team, the blue team, or not a goal for either team, and returns a corresponding value (0 for red, 1 for blue, -1 for neither).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.' and the second character is either a digit from 0 to 9 or 'G' or 'Q'.
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the first character of the string 'el' is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates a given 2-character string 'el' and returns True if the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns False.
