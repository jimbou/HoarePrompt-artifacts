This function simulates a game where players move around a grid, score goals, and catch the golden snitch. It reads input from stdin, including the grid size, grid layout, player positions, and commands to move players or catch the snitch. The function updates the game state based on the commands, prints messages for goals, eliminations, and snitch catches, and finally prints the final score. The game state includes the positions of all players, the points scored by each team, and the status of the golden snitch.
