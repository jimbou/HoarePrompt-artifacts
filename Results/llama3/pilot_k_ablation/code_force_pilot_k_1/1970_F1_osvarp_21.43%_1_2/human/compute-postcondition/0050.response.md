Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lines, each containing m pairs of characters separated by spaces, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in grid, allPlayers is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in grid, goal is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, points is a list of two integers where points[team] is 1 and the other element is 0 if the current position of obj is in the goal, otherwise points is a list of two zeros, t must be greater than 0, time is 0, comand is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, obj is a pair of characters, com is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), pos is the coordinates of obj in grid, nxt is the coordinates of the next position of obj after applying the command com, and stdin contains t-1 lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces. If obj is '.B' and the next position of obj is a player in grid, or if obj is a player and the next position of obj is '.B', then this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if com is 'T' and the current position of obj is in the goal, this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 0 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal of team at position pos. If com is not 'T' and obj is a player, the value for key obj in elements is updated to nxt.***
