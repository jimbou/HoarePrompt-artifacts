The code prints the current time and the name of the goal for the team, followed by the string 'CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH'. The time is 0, and the goal name is determined by the team, which is not explicitly defined in the precondition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the goal name is likely to be either 'WG' or 'BG', which are the keys in the goal list.

Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team, either 'WG' or 'BG')**
