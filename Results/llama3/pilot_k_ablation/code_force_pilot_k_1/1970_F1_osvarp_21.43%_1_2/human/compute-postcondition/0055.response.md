Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two integers where each integer represents the total points scored by each team, `t` is an integer, and stdin is empty. The state of `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `points` is updated based on the commands executed in the loop. If a player catches the golden snitch, the corresponding team's points are updated and a message is printed. If a player is eliminated, a message is printed. If a goal is scored, the corresponding team's points are updated and a message is printed.**
