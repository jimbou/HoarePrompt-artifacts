The code prints the current time and the player that is eliminated after applying the command `com` to the object `obj` at position `pos` in the grid.

Here, `time` is the current time which is 0, and `player` is the player occupying the next position of `obj` after applying the command `com`. The exact value of `player` depends on the state of the grid and the command `com` applied to the object `obj`.

Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is the player occupying the next position of obj after applying the command com)**
