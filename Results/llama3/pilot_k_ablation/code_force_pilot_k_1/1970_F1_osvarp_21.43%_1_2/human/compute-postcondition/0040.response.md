Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid` where `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is the coordinates of `obj` in `grid`, `nxt` is the coordinates of the next position of `obj` after applying the command `com`, `team` is the team of the goal at position `pos`, and stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or the next position of `obj` is not a player in `grid`, and either `obj` is not a player or the next position of `obj` is not '.B'. The current value of `com` is 'T'. The current position of `obj` is in the goal.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the variable `team` which is assigned the team of the goal at the current position of `obj`. The current position of `obj` is in the goal, and the command `com` is 'T'. All other variables remain unchanged.
