Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, and stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces. If `comand` has exactly 3 elements, then if `el` is equal to '.Q', the value of '.Q' is True. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `points` is a list containing 10 and 0, and '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed where time is 0 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `comand` does not have exactly 3 elements, then `points` is a list of two integers where `points[team]` is 1 and the other element is 0 if the current position of `obj` is in the `goal`, otherwise `points` is a list of two zeros. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements['.B']` is updated to `nxt`.***
