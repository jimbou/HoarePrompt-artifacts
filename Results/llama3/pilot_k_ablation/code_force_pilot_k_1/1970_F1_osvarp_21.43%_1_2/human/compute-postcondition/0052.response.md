Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, where `elements['.B']` is updated to `nxt`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two integers where `points[team]` is 1 and the other element is 0 if the current position of `obj` is in the `goal`, otherwise `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters '.B', `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is the coordinates of `obj` in `grid`, `nxt` is the coordinates of the next position of `obj` after applying the command `com`, and stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `elements` dictionary for the key '.B' is updated to the next position `nxt` of the object '.B' after applying the command `com`. All other variables remain unchanged.
