Based on the precondition, the `points` list contains two integers representing the total points scored by each team. The `print` statement is executed after the loop, which means that the points have been updated based on the commands executed in the loop.

The `points[0]` refers to the points scored by the first team, and `points[1]` refers to the points scored by the second team.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the final score of the game, with the points scored by each team.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the total points scored by each team)**
