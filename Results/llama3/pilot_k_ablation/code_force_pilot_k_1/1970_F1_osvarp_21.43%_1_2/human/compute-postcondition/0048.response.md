Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `obj` is a pair of characters, `com` is a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T), `pos` is the coordinates of `obj` in `grid`, `nxt` is the coordinates of the next position of `obj` after applying the command `com`, and stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or the next position of `obj` is not a player in `grid`, and either `obj` is not a player or the next position of `obj` is not '.B'. The command `com` is not 'T'. If `obj` is a player, the value for key `obj` in `elements` is updated to `nxt`.***
