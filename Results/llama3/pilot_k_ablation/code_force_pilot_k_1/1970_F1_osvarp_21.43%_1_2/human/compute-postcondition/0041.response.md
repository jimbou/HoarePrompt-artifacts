Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the current time and the name of the goal that the object is in, followed by the string 'GOAL'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `time` is 0, so the first part of the output will be '0'.
* `team` is the team of the goal at the current position of `obj`, which is in the goal. Since `obj` is in the goal, `team` must be either 'WG' or 'BG'. Let's assume it's 'WG' for now.
* `GoalName[team]` will be the name of the goal for the team 'WG'. Since the exact value of `GoalName['WG']` is not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, it's likely that `GoalName['WG']` is a string that represents the name of the white goal.
* The string 'GOAL' will be appended to the end of the output.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0 [GoalName['WG']] GOAL**

Note that if `team` is 'BG', the output will be:

Output: **0 [GoalName['BG']] GOAL**

Since we don't know the exact value of `GoalName['WG']` or `GoalName['BG']`, we can't provide a more precise output.
