Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each non-'..' element in `grid`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in `grid`, `goal` is a list of two lists, where the first list contains the coordinates of 'WG' elements and the second list contains the coordinates of 'BG' elements, `points` is a list of two zeros, `t` is an integer, and stdin contains `t` lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to an integer, which is the first input from `stdin`. The other variables remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains `t` lines of input, each containing a pair of characters and a command.
