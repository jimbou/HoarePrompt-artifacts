Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines, each containing `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' is (0, 0) and `line[ind]` is (i, ind), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is a list of two zeros, `stdin` contains an integer `t`, and then `t` lines each containing a pair of characters and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T) separated by spaces, `i` is 0, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'.**

In this output state, the `elements` dictionary has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is the current value of `line[ind]` and the value is the pair `(i, ind)`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
