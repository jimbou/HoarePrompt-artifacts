Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer and a string of "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between the total number of characters and twice the number of "-" characters in the string, unless the total number of characters equals the number of "-" characters, in which case it prints the total number of characters.**
