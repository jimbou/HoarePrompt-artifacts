The code prints the absolute difference between the total number of characters `n` and twice the number of "-" characters `neg` in the string `s`, unless the number of "-" characters `neg` is equal to the total number of characters `n`, in which case it prints the total number of characters `n`.

Output: **the absolute difference between the total number of characters `n` and twice the number of "-" characters `neg` in the string `s`, or `n` if `n` equals `neg`**
