The code prints the absolute difference between the total number of characters `n` and twice the number of '-' characters `neg` in the string `s`, unless the total number of characters `n` is equal to the number of '-' characters `neg`, in which case it prints the total number of characters `n`.

Output: **the absolute difference between n and twice the number of '-' characters in s, or n if n equals the number of '-' characters in s**
