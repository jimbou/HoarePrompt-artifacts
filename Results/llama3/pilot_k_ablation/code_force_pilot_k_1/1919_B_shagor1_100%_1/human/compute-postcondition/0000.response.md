Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of "+" and "-" characters with a length equal to n, neg is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is the first input from stdin. The value of `s` is a string of "+" and "-" characters with a length equal to `n`, which is the second input from stdin. The variable `neg` is initialized to 0. Since one test case has been processed, stdin now contains one less test case.
