To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least one character. Since `n` is the length of `s` and is between 1 and 5000, we can infer that `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` will take on the value of the first character in `s` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of "+" and "-" characters of length `n` that must have at least one character, `neg` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first character in `s`**
