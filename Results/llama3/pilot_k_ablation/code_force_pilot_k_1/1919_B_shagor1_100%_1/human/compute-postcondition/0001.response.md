The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of "+" and "-" characters with a length equal to `n`, `neg` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `s` is not empty and `i` is the first character in `s`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of "+" and "-" characters with a length equal to `n`, `neg` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first character in `s`**
