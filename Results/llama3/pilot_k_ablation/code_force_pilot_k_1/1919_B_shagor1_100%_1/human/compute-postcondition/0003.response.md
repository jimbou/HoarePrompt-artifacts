Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of "+" and "-" characters with a length equal to `n`, `neg` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the first character `i` in `s` is currently "-".**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is still a non-empty string of "+" and "-" characters with a length equal to `n`, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, and the first character `i` in `s` is still "-".
