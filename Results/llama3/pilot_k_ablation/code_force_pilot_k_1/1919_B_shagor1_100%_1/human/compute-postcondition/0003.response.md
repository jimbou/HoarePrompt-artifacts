Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of "+" and "-" characters of length `n` that must have at least one character, `neg` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the first character `i` of `s` is currently '-'**.

The code increments the value of `neg` by 1. Since the initial value of `neg` is 0, it becomes 1 after the execution of the code. The other variables `n`, `s`, `stdin`, and the first character `i` of `s` remain unchanged.
