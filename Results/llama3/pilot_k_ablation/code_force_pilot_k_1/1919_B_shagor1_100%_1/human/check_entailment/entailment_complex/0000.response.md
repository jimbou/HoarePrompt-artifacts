Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '-' characters in the input string `s` and then printing the absolute difference between the length of `s` and twice the number of '-' characters. If the length of `s` is equal to the number of '-' characters, it prints the length of `s`.

This approach is correct because the optimal way to split the array `a` is to group consecutive '+' and '-' characters together. The penalty of each group is then the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. Since the sum of each group is either 1 or -1, the penalty of each group is equal to its length.

By counting the number of '-' characters and calculating the absolute difference between the length of `s` and twice the number of '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
