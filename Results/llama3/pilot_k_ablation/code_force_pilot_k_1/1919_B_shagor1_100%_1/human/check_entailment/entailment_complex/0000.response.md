Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array of 1s and -1s into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of "-" characters in the string and then printing the absolute difference between the total number of characters and twice the number of "-" characters. If the total number of characters equals the number of "-" characters, it prints the total number of characters.

This approach is correct because it effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty by considering the optimal way to split the array into subarrays. The optimal way to split the array is to group consecutive "+" and "-" characters together, which results in subarrays with sums that are either 0 or 1. The penalty for these subarrays is 0 or 1 multiplied by their length, which is the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
