Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of "-" characters in the string `s` and then printing the absolute difference between the total number of characters `n` and twice the number of "-" characters `neg`. If `n` equals `neg`, it prints `n`.

This approach is correct because the optimal way to split the array is to group the "+" and "-" characters together in a way that minimizes the sum of the penalties of the subarrays. By counting the number of "-" characters, the program is effectively grouping the "-" characters together and calculating the minimum possible penalty.

The program handles the edge case where `n` equals `neg` correctly by printing `n`, which is the minimum possible penalty in this case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
