Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either 0 or 1. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so a sum of 0 or 1 results in the minimum possible penalty.

The program calculates the minimum possible penalty by printing the absolute difference between `n` and twice the number of '-' characters in `s`, or `n` if `n` equals the number of '-' characters in `s`. This is because the sum of the array is `n - 2 * neg`, and the minimum possible penalty is achieved when this sum is either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
