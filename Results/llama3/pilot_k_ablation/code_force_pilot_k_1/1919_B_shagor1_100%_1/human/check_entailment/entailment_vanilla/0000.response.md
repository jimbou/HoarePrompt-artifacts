Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

2. Inside the loop, the program calls the function `func_1()` which reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

3. The function `func_1()` then initializes a variable `neg` to 0, which is used to count the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

4. The program then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is '-', it increments the `neg` variable.

5. After counting the number of '-' characters, the program calculates the minimum possible penalty using the formula `abs(n - 2 * neg) if n != neg else n`. This formula works because the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. By counting the number of '-' characters, the program can calculate the total sum of the array and then use this formula to find the minimum possible penalty.

6. Finally, the program prints the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
