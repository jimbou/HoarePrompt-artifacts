Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '-' characters in the string and then calculating the absolute difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of '-' characters. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is determined by the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, in which case the penalty is the length of the string. The program also handles the case where the string consists only of '+' or '-' characters, in which case the penalty is the length of the string.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
