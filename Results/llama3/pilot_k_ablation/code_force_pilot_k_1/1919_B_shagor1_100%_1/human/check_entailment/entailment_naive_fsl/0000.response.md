Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The key insight is that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program calculates the number of negative signs in the input string `s` and then calculates the absolute difference between the total length `n` and twice the number of negative signs. This is because each negative sign contributes -1 to the sum, and each positive sign contributes 1. The absolute difference gives the minimum possible penalty.

The program also handles the edge case where the number of negative signs is equal to the total length `n`, in which case the penalty is simply `n`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
