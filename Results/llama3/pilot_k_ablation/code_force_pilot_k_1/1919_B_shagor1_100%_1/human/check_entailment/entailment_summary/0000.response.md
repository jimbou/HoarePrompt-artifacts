Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of "-" characters in the string and then calculating the absolute difference between the total number of characters and twice the number of "-" characters. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is the difference between the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters. The program also handles the case where the total number of characters equals the number of "-" characters correctly by printing the total number of characters.

Correctness: **True**
