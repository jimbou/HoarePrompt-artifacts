Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program works by first reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself. It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of '-' characters. If the length of the string is equal to the number of '-' characters, it prints the length of the string.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays with alternating sums of 1 and -1. The absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of '-' characters represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's execution summary matches its intended behavior, and it correctly handles the edge case where the length of the string is equal to the number of '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
