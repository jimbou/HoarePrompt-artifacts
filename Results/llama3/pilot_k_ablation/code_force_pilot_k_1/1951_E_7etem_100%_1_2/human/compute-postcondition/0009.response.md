Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is odd, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `a` is 1, and the current value of `func_1(ch[:b])` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 1, while the values of `ch` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still odd, and `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`. Additionally, the current value of `func_1(ch[:b])` is still True.
