Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even. `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`. The function `func_1` returns False for the first half of the string `ch`. `a` is 4.**

The code only assigns a new value to the variable `a`, which is now 4. The other variables, `ch` and `b`, and the function `func_1` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `a` and the unchanged values of `ch`, `b`, and the behavior of `func_1`.
