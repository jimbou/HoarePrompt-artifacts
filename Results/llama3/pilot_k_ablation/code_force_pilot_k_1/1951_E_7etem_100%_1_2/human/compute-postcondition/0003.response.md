Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even. `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`. The current value of `ch[:b]` satisfies the condition `func_1(ch[:b])`, `a` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 3, while the values of `ch` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still even, and `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`. Additionally, the condition `func_1(ch[:b])` is still satisfied for the current value of `ch[:b]`.
