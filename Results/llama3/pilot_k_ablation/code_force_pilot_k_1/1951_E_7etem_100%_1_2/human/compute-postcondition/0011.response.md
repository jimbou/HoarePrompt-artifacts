Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`. The length of `ch` is odd. `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, `a` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 2, while the values of `ch` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still odd, and `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`. The function `func_1(ch[:b])` still returns False.
