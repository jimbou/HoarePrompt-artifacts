Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings that are not palindromes. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

`func_2` takes a string `ch` as input and returns an integer value based on the length of the string and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome. The function uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not actually partition the input string into substrings. It only checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome and returns an integer value based on that.
2. The program does not handle the case where the input string has a length of 1. In this case, the string is always a palindrome, and the program should return "NO".
3. The program does not handle the case where the input string consists only of the same character repeated multiple times. In this case, the string is always a palindrome, and the program should return "NO".
4. The program does not provide the correct output format. According to the problem statement, the program should output "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of parts and the partitioned substrings.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
