Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem of partitioning a string into non-palindromic substrings. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used correctly to achieve this goal.

One potential case where the program fails is when the input string is a single character, for example "a". In this case, the program does not output "YES" or "NO" as required, but instead does not produce any output.

Another potential case where the program fails is when the input string is a palindrome, for example "abccba". In this case, the program does not output "NO" as required, but instead does not produce any output.

The program also does not correctly handle the case where the input string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the input string "uwuowouwu" can be partitioned into ["uw", "uow", "ouwu"], but the program does not output this partition.

Overall, the program does not correctly solve the problem and does not produce the required output for all potential cases.
