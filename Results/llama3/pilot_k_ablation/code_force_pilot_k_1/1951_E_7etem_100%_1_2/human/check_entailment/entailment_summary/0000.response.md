Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` checks if the first half of a given string is the same as the reversed second half. This function is used to determine if a string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.

`func_2` categorizes a string based on its length and the result of `func_1` applied to the first half of the string. The categorization is used to determine the number of partitions required to make all substrings non-palindromic.

The main program iterates over each test case and applies the following logic:

1. If the input string is a single character or a repetition of the same character, it is not possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, so the program prints "NO".
2. If the input string is a palindrome, the program checks if it can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings using `func_1`. If it can, the program prints "YES" and the partitioned substrings.
3. If the input string is not a palindrome, the program uses `func_2` to categorize it and determine the number of partitions required. Based on the category, the program partitions the string into non-palindromic substrings and prints "YES" and the partitioned substrings.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
