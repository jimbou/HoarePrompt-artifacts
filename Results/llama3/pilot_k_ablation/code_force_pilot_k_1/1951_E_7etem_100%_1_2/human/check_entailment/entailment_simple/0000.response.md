Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a string s needs to be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine the number of parts the string needs to be partitioned into, respectively.

The program first checks if the input string s is a palindrome or if it can be partitioned into two identical substrings. If it is, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it calls func_1 to check if the string is a palindrome. If it is not, the program calls func_2 to determine the number of parts the string needs to be partitioned into.

The program then uses the result of func_2 to partition the string into the required number of parts. If the string can be partitioned into the required number of parts, the program prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the partitioned string. If the string cannot be partitioned into the required number of parts, the program prints "NO".

Based on the provided execution states, the program seems to be working correctly. It correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
