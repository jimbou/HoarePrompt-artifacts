To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution directly). However, since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop execution, we need to ensure it's in a state that allows the loop to run.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), it's guaranteed to be greater than 0.

However, we also need to consider the state of `stdin`, which contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`. For the loop to execute, `stdin` should have at least `t` pairs of integers available.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains at least `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`**
