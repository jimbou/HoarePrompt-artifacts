Based on the initial state, the print statement `print(*res)` will print the elements of the list `res`.

The list `res` has a length of `n`, and its elements are determined by the values of `n` and `k`. 

- If `k` is equal to `n`, all elements of `res` are 1.
- If `k` is 1, all elements of `res` are a range from 1 to `n`.
- Otherwise, all elements of `res` are -1.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact elements of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `res` as determined by the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **[1 if k is equal to n, a range from 1 to n if k is 1, otherwise -1] (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3, and k is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
