The code prints the elements of the list `res` as separate values, without any separators or formatting. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list and passes its elements as individual arguments to the function.

Since the exact values of `res` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `res`.

Output: **elements of the list res (where res is a list of integers)**
