The code snippet reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from stdin, and then assigns a value to the list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. 

If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` is equal to 1, `res` becomes a list of numbers from 1 to `n`. If neither of these conditions is met, `res` becomes a list containing a single -1.

The variable `t` is not modified by the code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers, stdin contains at least t - 1 pairs of integers**
