Functionality: **This function reads a series of input pairs from standard input, where each pair consists of two integers, n and k. It then generates a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If k is equal to n, the list contains all 1s. If k is 1, the list contains the numbers from 1 to n. For any other values of k, the list contains a single -1. The function prints each generated list to the console, one list per input pair.**
