Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), as it has been assigned the value of the first input from stdin. The remaining input in stdin consists of t pairs of integers n and k, where k is between 1 and n, and n is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).
