This function reads a series of input pairs from the standard input, where each pair consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a list of integers based on the values of n and k, and prints this list. The list contains all 1's if k is equal to n, a range of numbers from 1 to n if k is 1, and all -1's otherwise. The function repeats this process for a number of times specified by the first input integer t, and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
