Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program takes the number of test cases `t` as input, and for each test case, it takes the length of the array `n` and the number of sorted cyclic shifts `k` as input.

The program uses a list comprehension to generate the array `a` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is equal to `n`, the program generates an array of `n` ones, which will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted. If `k` is equal to 1, the program generates an array of numbers from 1 to `n`, which will have only one sorted cyclic shift. For all other values of `k`, the program generates an array containing only -1, indicating that there is no valid array `a`.

The program then prints the generated array `a` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. If `k` is equal to `n`, the array of ones will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted. If `k` is equal to 1, the array of numbers from 1 to `n` will have only one sorted cyclic shift. For all other values of `k`, there is no valid array `a`, so the program correctly outputs -1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
