Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k is greater than 1 and less than n. In this case, the program will output [-1], but it should output a valid array a that satisfies the given conditions.

For example, when n = 4 and k = 2, the program will output [-1], but a valid array a that satisfies the conditions is [1, 2, 3, 1]. This array has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2, 3].

The program only handles the cases when k is equal to n or 1, but it does not handle the cases when k is greater than 1 and less than n. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
