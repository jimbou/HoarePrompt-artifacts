Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program outputs [-1], but according to the problem description, there should be a valid array a that satisfies the requirements. 

In this case, a = [1, 2, 3] would be a valid solution, but the program does not output this. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
