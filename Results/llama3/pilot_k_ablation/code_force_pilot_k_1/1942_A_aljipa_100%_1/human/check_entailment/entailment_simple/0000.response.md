Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the desired array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `k` is equal to `n`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program generates an array of all 1's, which satisfies the condition.
2. If `k` is equal to 1, it means that only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program generates an array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition.
3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the condition. In this case, the program generates an array containing only -1, indicating that no solution exists.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently handles all possible cases. The use of list comprehensions and conditional expressions makes the code concise and readable.

Correctness: **True**
