Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1. If k is equal to n, it generates a list of all 1s, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
2. If k is 1, it generates a list of numbers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.
3. For any other values of k, it generates a list containing a single -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible input cases.

Correctness: **True**
