Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

- If k is equal to n, it generates a list of all 1's, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the list are sorted.
- If k is 1, it generates a list of numbers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the list is sorted (the original list itself).
- If k is neither 1 nor n, it generates a list containing only -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program also correctly reads the input pairs and repeats the process for the specified number of times.

Correctness: **True**
