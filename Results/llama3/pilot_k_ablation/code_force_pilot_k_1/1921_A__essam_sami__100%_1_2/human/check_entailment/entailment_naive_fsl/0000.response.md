Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h) where (a, b) and (c, d) are two adjacent corners of the square, and (e, f) and (g, h) are the other two adjacent corners. 

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) which is 9, and the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 2) which is 9, and then it will print 9. However, the correct area of the square is 9, but the program is not guaranteed to always work correctly because it relies on the order of the input coordinates.

A correct program would find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x or y coordinates.
