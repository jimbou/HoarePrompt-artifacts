Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by 4t lines of two integers each, representing coordinates of squares. It then calculates the squared distances between points on each square and prints the smaller of the two squared distances for each square. The function consumes all input from stdin and produces t output values, one for each square.**
