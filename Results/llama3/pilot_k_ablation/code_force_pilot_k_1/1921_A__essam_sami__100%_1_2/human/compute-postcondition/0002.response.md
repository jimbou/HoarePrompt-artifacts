Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains 4t - 4 lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), steps is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, e is an integer, f is an integer, g is an integer, h is an integer, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of lines in stdin is reduced by 4 due to the four `input()` calls. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are assigned the integer values from the input lines. The values of `n` and `x` are calculated based on the assigned values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`, and are non-negative integers since they are the sum of squares of differences between integers. The value of `steps` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
