The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The input contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000). After reading the integer `t`, the input still contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000).**
