The only variables in the loop head are variables  steps and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000). So for the loop to be executed, t must be at least 1 and steps is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), steps is 0**
