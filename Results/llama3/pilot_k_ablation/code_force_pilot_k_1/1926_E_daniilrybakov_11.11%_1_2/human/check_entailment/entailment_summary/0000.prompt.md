Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

    34 14
    
    84 19

Output

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        n_back = n
        s = (n + 1) // 2
        n = (n + 1) // 2
        m = 1
        while s < k:
            if n == 0:
                s = n_back
                n = 1
                break
            m *= 2
            n //= 2
            s += n
        print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)





# Execution Summary:
This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on `n` and `k` using a while loop and prints the result. The function continues this process until all `t` test cases have been processed, at which point it leaves the input stream empty and the variables `m`, `n`, `n_back`, and `s` undefined. The function's primary purpose is to perform calculations and print results for multiple test cases based on input values.
