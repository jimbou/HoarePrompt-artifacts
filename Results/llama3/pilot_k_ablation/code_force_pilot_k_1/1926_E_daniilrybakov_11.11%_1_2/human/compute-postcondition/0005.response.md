The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`. Since `n_back` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `s` becomes an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The second line assigns the value 1 to `n`. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n_back is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, s is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, n is 1, m is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9) and k is greater than s**
