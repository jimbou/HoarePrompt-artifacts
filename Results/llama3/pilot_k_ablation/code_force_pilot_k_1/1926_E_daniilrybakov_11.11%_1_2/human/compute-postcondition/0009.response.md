The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`. 

Here, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, and `m` is a power of 2.

Since the exact values of `k`, `s`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the given expression.

Output: **(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, s is greater than or equal to k, n is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, and m is a power of 2)**
