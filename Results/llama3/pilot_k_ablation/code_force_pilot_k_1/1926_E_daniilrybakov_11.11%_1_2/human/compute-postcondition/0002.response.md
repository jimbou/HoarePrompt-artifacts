Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n_back is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, s is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, m is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n_back` is set to the value of `n` from the first line of stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The value of `s` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive. The value of `n` is also updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive. The value of `m` is set to 1. The stdin now contains `t - 1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), as one line has been read and processed.
