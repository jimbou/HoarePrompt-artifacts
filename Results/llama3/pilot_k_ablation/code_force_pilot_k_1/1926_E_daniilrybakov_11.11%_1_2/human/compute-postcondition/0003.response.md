According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. `k` being an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n_back is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, s is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, m is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9) and k is greater than s**
