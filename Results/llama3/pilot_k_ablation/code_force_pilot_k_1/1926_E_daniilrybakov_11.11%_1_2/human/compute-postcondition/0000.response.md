Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k, where k is between 1 and n, and n is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
