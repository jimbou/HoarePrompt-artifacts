Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n_back is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, s is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, m is 2, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9) and k is greater than s**

The code modifies the values of `m`, `n`, and `s`. The first line doubles the value of `m`, making it 2. The second line halves the value of `n`, which remains an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive. The third line adds the new value of `n` to `s`, making `s` greater than its original value. The values of `t`, `n_back`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
