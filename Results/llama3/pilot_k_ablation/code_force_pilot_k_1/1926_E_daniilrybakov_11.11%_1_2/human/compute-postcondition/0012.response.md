Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on `n` and `k` using a while loop and prints the result. The function continues this process until all `t` test cases have been processed, at which point it leaves the input stream empty and the variables `m`, `n`, `n_back`, and `s` undefined. The function's primary purpose is to perform calculations and print results for multiple test cases based on input values.**
