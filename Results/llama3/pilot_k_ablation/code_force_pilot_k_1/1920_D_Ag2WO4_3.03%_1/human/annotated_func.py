#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries.

    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value of b at index x, where x is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), and b is a list of integers representing the result of the operations, with the value at index x being either the number of copies (1 <= x <= 10^9) or the result of the operation (1 or 2).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers x and a flag f as input, where x represents a list of test cases with operations and queries, and f is a flag that determines the function's behavior. The function iterates through the operations in reverse order, applying the operations to the value of x. If f is 0, the function returns the value of b at index x, where b is a list of integers representing the result of the operations. If f is not 0, the function applies the operations to x, updating its value based on the operations, and returns the final value of x, which is either 0 or the remainder of the original value of x divided by the product of all a[2 * i + 1] values where a[2 * i] is less than the original value of x.
