#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a list of two integers n and q, followed by n lists of two integers b and x, and a list of q integers.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the first element of the original list of integers representing the number of test cases, and the current value of f is 0.
    #State: *`x` is the first element of the original list of integers, which is the number of test cases, and the rest of the initial state remains the same. Additionally, `f` is not equal to 0.
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than the original `x`, or `x` is 0 if the original `x` is a multiple of any element in the list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers and two lists `a` and `b` as input. It first checks if the value of `f` is 0, and if so, returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. If `f` is not 0, it iterates through the list `a` in reverse order, updating the value of `x` based on the elements of `a` until it finds a suitable value to return from list `b`. The function returns a value from list `b` based on the updated value of `x`, which is either the remainder of the original `x` divided by an element in `a` or 0 if the original `x` is a multiple of an element in `a`.
