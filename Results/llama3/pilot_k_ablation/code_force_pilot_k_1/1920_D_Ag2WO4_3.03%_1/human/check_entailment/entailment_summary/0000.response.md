Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of array a after a series of operations. The program uses two lists, a and b, to keep track of the size of the array and the elements appended to the array, respectively. The program also uses a variable f to keep track of the number of times the array is copied.

The program first reads the number of operations and queries, and then reads the operations and queries. For each operation, it updates the size of the array and the elements appended to the array accordingly. For each query, it calls the function func_1 to determine the k-th element of the array.

The function func_1 takes an integer x as input and returns the x-th element of the array. It first checks if the value of f is 0, and if so, returns the value at index x in list b. If f is not 0, it iterates through the list a in reverse order, updating the value of x based on the elements of a until it finds a suitable value to return from list b.

The program then prints the results of the queries.

Correctness: **True**
