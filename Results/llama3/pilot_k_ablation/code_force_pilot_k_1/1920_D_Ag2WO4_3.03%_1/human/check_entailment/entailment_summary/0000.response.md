Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves performing operations on an array and answering queries about the array's elements. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the array's size and a dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array. It iterates through the operations, updating the array's size and elements accordingly. For each query, it uses the `func_1` function to determine the k-th element of the array.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The `func_1` function is not defined correctly. It seems to be missing the `r` function, which is used in the `print` statement. Also, the function is not correctly handling the case when `f` is not 0.

2. The program does not handle the case when the array's size exceeds 10^18. In such cases, the program may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

3. The program does not handle the case when the input is invalid. For example, if the input contains negative numbers or non-integer values, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

4. The program does not follow the problem's constraints. For example, it does not check if the number of operations `n` is within the range [1, 10^5].

5. The program does not handle the case when the number of queries `q` is 0. In such cases, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

6. The program does not handle the case when the query values are not within the range [1, 10^18]. In such cases, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

7. The program does not handle the case when the array's size is 0. In such cases, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

8. The program does not handle the case when the input contains duplicate operations. In such cases, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

9. The program does not handle the case when the input contains operations that are not of type 1 or 2. In such cases, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

10. The program does not handle the case when the input contains queries that are not within the range [1, 10^18]. In such cases, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

Correctness: **False**
