Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes an array `a` with two elements, both set to 0. This array will be used to keep track of the size of the array after each operation. The `b` dictionary is used to store the values appended to the array.

2. The program reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d` for each test case.

3. It then iterates over each operation. If the operation is of type 1 (appending an integer), it increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the appended value in the `b` dictionary. If the operation is of type 2 (appending copies of the array), it checks if the array has at least one element. If it does, it appends the current size of the array to `a`, multiplies it by the number of copies plus one, and appends the new size to `a`. If the array is empty, it simply multiplies the last size by the number of copies plus one.

4. After all operations are processed, the program reads the queries. However, the program does not correctly process the queries. The function `func_1` is defined to handle the queries, but it is not called correctly in the program. The program tries to call a function `r` which is not defined.

5. The function `func_1` takes a query `x` and checks if the array has been copied at least once. If not, it simply returns the value at index `x` in the `b` dictionary. If the array has been copied, it iterates over the sizes of the array in reverse order. If the query `x` is within the range of the current size, it continues to the next size. If `x` is greater than the current size, it takes the modulus of `x` with the current size plus one. If the result is 0, it returns the value at the current size in the `b` dictionary. If the result is not 0 and the current size is greater than or equal to the result, it continues to the next size. Otherwise, it returns the value at index `x` in the `b` dictionary.

6. However, the program does not correctly handle the case when the query `x` is greater than the size of the array. In this case, the function `func_1` will not return the correct value.

7. Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the array is empty. In this case, the function `func_1` will throw an error when trying to access the `b` dictionary.

Correctness: **False**
