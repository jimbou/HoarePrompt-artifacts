Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The operations involve appending integers or copies of the array to the end of the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program initializes an array `a` with two elements, both set to 0. This array is used to keep track of the size of the array after each operation. The variable `f` is used to count the number of times the array is copied.

2.  The program reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then reads each operation, which is either appending an integer or copying the array.

3.  If the operation is appending an integer, the program increments the last element of array `a` by 1 and stores the appended integer in a dictionary `b` with the current index as the key.

4.  If the operation is copying the array, the program checks if the array has at least one element. If it does, the program appends the current size of the array to `a`, multiplies it by the number of copies plus one, and appends the result to `a`. The variable `f` is incremented to count the number of copies. If the array is empty, the program simply multiplies the current size by the number of copies plus one.

5.  After reading all operations, the program reads the queries, which are the indices of the elements to be retrieved from the array.

6.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an index `x` as input and returns the element at that index in the array. The function works by iterating through the array from the last copy operation to the first. If the index is within the range of a copy operation, the function returns the element at the corresponding index in the original array. If the index is not within the range of any copy operation, the function returns the element at the corresponding index in the original array.

7.  The program prints the results of the queries by mapping the `func_1` function to each query and joining the results into a string.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, the program correctly handles the operations and queries.

Correctness: **True**
