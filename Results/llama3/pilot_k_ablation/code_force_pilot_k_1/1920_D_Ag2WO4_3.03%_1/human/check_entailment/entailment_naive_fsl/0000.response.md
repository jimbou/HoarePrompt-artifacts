Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query k is equal to the size of the array after finishing all n operations. In this case, the program should return the last element of the array, but the function func_1 does not handle this case correctly.

For example, consider the input:

4
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The size of the array after finishing all n operations is 20. If we query k = 20, the program should return the last element of the array, which is 3. However, the function func_1 does not handle this case correctly and returns an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
