Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query k is equal to the length of the array a. In this case, the program should return the last element of the array, but instead, it will return an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The correct output should be:

1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3

However, the program will return:

1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when k is equal to the length of the array a. When k is equal to the length of the array a, the program should return the last element of the array, but instead, it will return the second last element.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
