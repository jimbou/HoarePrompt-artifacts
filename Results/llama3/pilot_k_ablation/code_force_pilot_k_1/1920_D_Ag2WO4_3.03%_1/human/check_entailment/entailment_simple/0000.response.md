Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes an array `a` with two elements, both set to 0. This array will be used to keep track of the size of the array after each operation.

2. The program then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

3. It then reads each operation and updates the array `a` accordingly. If the operation is of type 1, it simply increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the value `e` in a dictionary `b` with the current index as the key. If the operation is of type 2, it checks if the last two elements of `a` are equal. If they are not equal, it appends the current last element of `a` to `a`, multiplies it by `e + 1`, and appends the result to `a`. It also increments a counter `f`. If the last two elements of `a` are equal, it simply multiplies the second last element of `a` by `e + 1` and updates the last element of `a`.

4. After reading all operations, the program reads the queries.

5. For each query, the program checks if `f` is 0. If `f` is 0, it simply returns the value of `b` at index `x`, where `x` is the query.

6. If `f` is not 0, the program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each pair of elements in `a`, it checks if the first element is greater than or equal to `x`. If it is, it continues to the next pair. If the second element is less than `x`, it calculates the remainder of `x` divided by the second element and updates `x` to be this remainder. If `x` becomes 0, it returns the value of `b` at index equal to the second element. If the first element is greater than or equal to `x`, it continues to the next pair.

7. If the program iterates over all pairs of elements in `a` and `x` is still not 0, it returns the value of `b` at index `x`.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases.
