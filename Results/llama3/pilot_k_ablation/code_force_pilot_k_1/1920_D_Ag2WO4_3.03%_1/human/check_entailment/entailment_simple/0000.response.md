Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program iterates over each test case, processing the operations and queries accordingly. It maintains a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the values appended to the array.

The program correctly handles the two types of operations: appending an integer to the end of the array and appending copies of the array to the end of the array. It also correctly processes the queries, finding the k-th element of the array.

The program uses a recursive approach to find the k-th element, starting from the last operation and moving backwards. It uses the modulo operator to handle cases where the k-th element is beyond the size of the array.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the k-th element is 0 or when the array size is 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
