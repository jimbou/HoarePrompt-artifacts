To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `f`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `f` is greater than 0. Since `f` is not equal to 0, we can adjust the state to `f` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` will start from `f - 1` and decrement by 1 in each iteration.

State: **`x` is the first element of the original list of integers, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`**
