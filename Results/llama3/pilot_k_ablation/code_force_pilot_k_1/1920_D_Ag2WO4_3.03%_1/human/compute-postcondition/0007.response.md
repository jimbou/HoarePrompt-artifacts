Postcondition: ***`x` is the first element of the original list of integers, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. If the element at index `2 * i` in the list `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues executing the code inside the loop.***
