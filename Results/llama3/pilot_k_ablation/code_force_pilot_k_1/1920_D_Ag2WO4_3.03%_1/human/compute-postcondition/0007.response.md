Postcondition: **The program iterates through the test cases, and for each test case, it processes the operations and queries. If the value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to process the operations and queries. The program maintains the integrity of the test cases, operations, and queries, ensuring that the number of operations and queries, as well as the values of `n`, `q`, `x`, and `f`, remain within their specified ranges.**
