You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value of b at index x, where x is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), and b is a list of integers representing the result of the operations, with the value at index x being either the number of copies (1 <= x <= 10^9) or the result of the operation (1 or 2).
    #State: *x is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries. f is not equal to 0
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: x is either 0 or the remainder of the original value of x divided by the product of all a[2 * i + 1] values where a[2 * i] is less than the original value of x, and f is 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of b at index x, where x is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), and b is a list of integers representing the result of the operations, with the value at index x being either the number of copies (1 <= x <= 10^9) or the result of the operation (1 or 2).

Case_2: x is either 0 or the remainder of the original value of x divided by the product of all a[2 * i + 1] values where a[2 * i] is less than the original value of x, and f is 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
