Postcondition: **The program iterates through the test cases, and for each test case, it processes the operations and queries. If the value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to process the operations and queries. If the value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`, the program updates the value of `x` to be the remainder of `x` divided by `a[2 * i + 1]`, ensuring that `x` is not equal to 0. The program maintains the integrity of the test cases, operations, and queries, ensuring that the number of operations and queries, as well as the values of `n`, `q`, `x`, and `f`, remain within their specified ranges.**
