Postcondition: ***`x` is the first element of the original list of integers, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. If the element at index `2 * i` in the list `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues executing the code inside the loop. If `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`, then `x` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by `a[2f - 1]`, which is less than `a[2f - 1]`, the element at index `2 * i` in the list `a` is less than the original `x`, the program is still inside the loop, and `x` is not equal to 0.***
