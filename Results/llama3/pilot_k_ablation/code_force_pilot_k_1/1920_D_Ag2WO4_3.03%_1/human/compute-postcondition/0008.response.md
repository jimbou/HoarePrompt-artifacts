Postcondition: **`x` is the first element of the original list of integers, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. The element at index `2 * i` in the list `a` is less than `x`. The current value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`. The program is currently inside the loop and has not skipped to the next iteration.**
