This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, a string s1 representing the current state of cat presence in n boxes, and a string s2 representing the desired state of cat presence in n boxes. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the current state into the desired state, where an operation is either adding or removing a cat from a box, and prints this minimum number of operations. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
