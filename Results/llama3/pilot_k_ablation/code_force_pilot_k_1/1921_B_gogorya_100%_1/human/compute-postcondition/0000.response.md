Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is now a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The rest of the input remains the same, with each test case consisting of three lines: the number of boxes `n`, the current state of the boxes `s`, and the desired state of the boxes `f`.
