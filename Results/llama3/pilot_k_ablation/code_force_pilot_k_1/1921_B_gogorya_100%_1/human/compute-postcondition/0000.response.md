Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, stdin now contains one less test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been read and is no longer in the stdin. Each test case still consists of three lines, but the first line of the first test case has been read and is no longer in the stdin.
