The code prints the sum of `res` and half of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res`. Here, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2` up to the length of `n`.

Output: **res + abs(hd - res) // 2 (where res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2 up to the length of n)**
