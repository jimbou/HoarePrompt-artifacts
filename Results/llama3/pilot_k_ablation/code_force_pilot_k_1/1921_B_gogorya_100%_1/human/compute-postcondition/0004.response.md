Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5). The second line contains a string `s` of `n` characters, where the `i`-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the `i`-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string `f` of `n` characters, where the `i`-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the `i`-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, stdin now contains one less test case, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `hd` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.**
