To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is 0, `i` is 0**
