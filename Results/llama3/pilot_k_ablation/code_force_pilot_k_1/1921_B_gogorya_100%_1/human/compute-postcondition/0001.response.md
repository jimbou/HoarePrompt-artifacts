To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer, this condition is already met. However, to make it explicit, we can state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1**
