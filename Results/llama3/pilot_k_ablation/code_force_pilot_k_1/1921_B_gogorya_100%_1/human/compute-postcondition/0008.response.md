Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5). The second line contains a string `s` of `n` characters, where the `i`-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the `i`-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string `f` of `n` characters, where the `i`-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the `i`-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, stdin now contains one less test case, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `hd` is the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
