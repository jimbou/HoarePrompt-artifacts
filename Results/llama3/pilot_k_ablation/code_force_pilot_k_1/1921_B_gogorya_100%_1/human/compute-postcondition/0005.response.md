Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `s1` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s2` at index `i`.**

The value of `hd` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition that the current value of `s1` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s2` at index `i` is still valid.
