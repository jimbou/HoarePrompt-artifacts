#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        hd = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                hd += 1
        
        res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
        
        print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, stdin contains no test cases, `_` is `t`, `n` is undefined, `s1` is undefined, `s2` is undefined, `hd` is undefined, `res` is undefined.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, a string s1 representing the current state of cat presence in n boxes, and a string s2 representing the desired state of cat presence in n boxes. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the current state into the desired state, where an operation is either adding or removing a cat from a box, and prints this minimum number of operations. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
