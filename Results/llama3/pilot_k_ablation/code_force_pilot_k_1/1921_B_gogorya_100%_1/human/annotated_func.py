#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        hd = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                hd += 1
        
        res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
        
        print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is undefined, `s1` is undefined, `s2` is undefined, `hd` is undefined, `res` is undefined.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, a string s1 representing the current state of cat boxes, and a string s2 representing the desired state of cat boxes. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the current state into the desired state, considering two types of operations: moving a cat from one box to another (represented by the Hamming distance between s1 and s2) and adding or removing a cat from a box (represented by the difference in the count of '1's between s1 and s2). The function then prints the minimum number of operations required for each test case.
