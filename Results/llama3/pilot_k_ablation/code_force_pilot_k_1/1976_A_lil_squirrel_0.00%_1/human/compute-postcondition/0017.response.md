Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, n is the first n in the first test case, password is the first password in the first test case. Either letters or digits or both are empty, or the characters in either the letters or the digits of the password are in sorted order, or the index of the last character of letters is less than or equal to the index of the first character of digits in the password. If the characters in either the letters or the digits of the password are not in sorted order, results is a list containing 'NO'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
