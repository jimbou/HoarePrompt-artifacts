Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the first `n` in the first test case, `password` is the first password in the first test case. Either letters or digits or both are empty, or the characters in either the letters or the digits of the password are in sorted order, or the index of the last character of letters is less than or equal to the index of the first character of digits in the password. `results` is a list containing 'NO' and 'YES'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer, and the list of test cases `test_cases` still has at least one test case. The values of `n` and `password` remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains both 'NO' and 'YES', indicating that the password has met the conditions of having either letters or digits or both empty, or the characters in either the letters or the digits in sorted order, or the index of the last character of letters is less than or equal to the index of the first character of digits.
