The code `letters += ch` appends the current character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `ch` is the first character in the password and is an alphabet character, `letters` now contains this alphabet character.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the first n in the first test case, `password` is the first password in the first test case and must have at least 1 character, `results` is an empty list, `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is an alphabet character, `digits` is an empty string, and the current value of `ch` is the first character in the password and is an alphabet character.**
