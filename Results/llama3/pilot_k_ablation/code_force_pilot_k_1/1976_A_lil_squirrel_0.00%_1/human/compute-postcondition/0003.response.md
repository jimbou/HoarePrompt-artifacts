Based on the provided state and the for loop statement, I will adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute.

The only variable in the loop head is `ch` and `password`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the first n in the first test case, `password` is the first password in the first test case and must have at least 1 character, `results` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string, `ch` is the first character in the password**
