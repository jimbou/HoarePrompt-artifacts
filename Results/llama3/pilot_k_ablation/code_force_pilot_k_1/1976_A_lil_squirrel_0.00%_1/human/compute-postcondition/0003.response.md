According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is the first positive integer in the first tuple, password is the first string in the first tuple, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string. So for the loop to be executed  the password must have at least 1 character and the ch is the first character in the password.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is the first positive integer in the first tuple, password is the first string in the first tuple and must have at least 1 character, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string, ch is the first character in the password**
