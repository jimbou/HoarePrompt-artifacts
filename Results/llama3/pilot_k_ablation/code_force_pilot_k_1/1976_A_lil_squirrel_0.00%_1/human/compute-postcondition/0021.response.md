Output State: **The program returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the corresponding password in the test_cases list meets the conditions: letters and digits are sorted in ascending order and the last letter does not appear after the first digit. If the test_cases list is empty, the results list is also empty.**
