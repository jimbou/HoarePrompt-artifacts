Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the first `n` in the first test case, `password` is the first password in the first test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO' if the characters in either the letters or the digits of the password are not in sorted order, and 'NO' has been appended to the results list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `password` remains the same as in the initial state. The `results` list now contains an additional 'NO' value, indicating that the characters in either the letters or the digits of the password are not in sorted order.
