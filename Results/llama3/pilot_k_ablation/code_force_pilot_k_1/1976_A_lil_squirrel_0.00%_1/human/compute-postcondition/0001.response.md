According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases. If the list has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 tuple and the n is the first positive integer in the first tuple and password is the first string in the first tuple.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer in the first tuple, `password` is the first string in the first tuple**
