The only objects in the loop head are variables  `n`, `password` and list  `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer and results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 test case and the n is the first n in the first test case and password is the first password in the first test case.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the first n in the first test case, `password` is the first password in the first test case, `results` is an empty list**
