Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer in the first tuple, `password` is the first string in the first tuple and must have at least 1 character, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is the first character in the password which is a digit, `ch` is the first character in the password and is a digit.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list of test cases remains the same with at least one tuple containing a positive integer and a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The results list is still empty. The value of `n` remains the same as the first positive integer in the first tuple. The password remains the same as the first string in the first tuple with at least one character. The letters string is still empty. The digits string now contains the first character of the password, which is a digit. The character `ch` is still the first character in the password and is a digit.
