This function evaluates a list of passwords based on specific conditions and returns a list of strings indicating whether each password meets these conditions. The conditions are: (1) letters and digits in the password must be sorted in ascending order, and (2) the last letter must not appear after the first digit. For each password, the function returns 'YES' if the password meets these conditions and 'NO' otherwise. If the input list of passwords is empty, the function returns an empty list.
