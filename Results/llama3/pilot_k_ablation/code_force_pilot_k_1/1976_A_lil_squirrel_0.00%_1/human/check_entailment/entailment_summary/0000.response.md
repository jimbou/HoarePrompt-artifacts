Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first separates the letters and digits from the password.
2. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in ascending order. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
3. If the letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter. This is done by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit in the password. If the last letter appears after the first digit, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
4. If the password passes both checks, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

The program correctly handles all the conditions for a strong password and returns the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
