Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. The program first separates the letters and digits from the password.

2. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in ascending order. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.

3. If the letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter. This is done by checking if the index of the last letter is greater than the index of the first digit. If this condition is true, it appends 'NO' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits.

5. The program also correctly handles the case where the test_cases list is empty. In this case, the results list will also be empty.

Correctness: **True**
