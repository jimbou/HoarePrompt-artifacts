Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It first separates the letters and digits from the password, then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it immediately returns 'NO'. If they are sorted, it then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If there is, it returns 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles passwords with repeated letters or digits.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
