Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q must be greater than 0, a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, i is 1, v is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, m is an integer equal to b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s].**

The code modifies the value of `ql` and `m`. The first line subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`, effectively reducing `ql` by the value of the element before the insertion point in sequence `a`. The second line adds the value of `b[s - 1]` to `m`, which is the value of the element before the insertion point in sequence `b`. The third line adds the product of `bd[s]` and the integer division of `ql` by `ad[s]` to `m`. This calculates the value of `m` as the sum of the value before the insertion point in sequence `b` and the product of the difference between consecutive elements in sequence `b` at the insertion point and the integer division of the reduced `ql` by the difference between consecutive elements in sequence `a` at the insertion point.
