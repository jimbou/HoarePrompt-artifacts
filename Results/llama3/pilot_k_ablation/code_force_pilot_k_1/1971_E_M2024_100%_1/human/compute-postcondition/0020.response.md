Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] * ql // ad[s], s is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `stdin`, `i`, `v`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from its original value. The value of `m` is updated by adding `b[s - 1]` and the result of the integer division of `bd[s] * ql` by `ad[s]` to its original value. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
