To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it is the only variable in the loop head. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines with a single integer d. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that k <= n <= 10^9, and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, and the sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5. The sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**
