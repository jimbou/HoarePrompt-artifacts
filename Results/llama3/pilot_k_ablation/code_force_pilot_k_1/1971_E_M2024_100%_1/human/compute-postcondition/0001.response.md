According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and _ is now 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three lines of input: two lines containing k integers and one line containing q integers.**
