To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(b)` is at least 2, since the range starts from 1. We also know that `i` is currently `k`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be 1, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**
