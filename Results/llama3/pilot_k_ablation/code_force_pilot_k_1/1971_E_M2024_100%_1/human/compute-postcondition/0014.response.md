Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q must be greater than 0, a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, i is 1, v is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order.**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns 0 to `m`. The second line assigns 1 to `i`. The third line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ql`. The fourth line uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order and assigns it to `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
