Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q must be greater than 0, a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, i is 1, v is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order. The current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and b[s] is printed, where b[s] is the s-th element of the strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers b, and the value of b[s] is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, and the only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
