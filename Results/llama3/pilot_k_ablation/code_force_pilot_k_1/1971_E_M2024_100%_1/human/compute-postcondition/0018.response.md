Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer. The current value of a[s] equals ql, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing any variable values.
