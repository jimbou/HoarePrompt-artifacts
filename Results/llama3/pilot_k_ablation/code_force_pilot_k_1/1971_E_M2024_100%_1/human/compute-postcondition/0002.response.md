Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with one element equal to 0, bd is a list with one element equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with three lines of input: k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q lines with a single integer d.**

The code assigns the values of n, k, and q from the first line of stdin to the corresponding variables. Then, it assigns the values of k integers a_i and k integers b_i from the next two lines of stdin to the lists a and b, respectively, with an additional element 0 at the beginning of each list. Finally, it initializes two lists ad and bd with a single element 0 each.
