To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a)`). Since `a` already has at least 2 integers, we don't need to adjust its state further. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts from 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing a single integer 0**
