Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines with a single integer d. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that k <= n <= 10^9, and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, and the sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5. The sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, followed by k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q single integers d. The constraints on n, k, q, a_i, and b_i remain the same as in the initial state.
