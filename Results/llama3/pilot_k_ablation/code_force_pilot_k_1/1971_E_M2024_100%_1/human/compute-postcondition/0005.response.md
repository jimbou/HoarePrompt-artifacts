Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with one element equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with three lines of input: k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q lines with a single integer d, i is k-1.**
