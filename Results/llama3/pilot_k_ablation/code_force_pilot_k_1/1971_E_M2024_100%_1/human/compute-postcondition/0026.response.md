Output State: **t is 0, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that k <= n <= 10^9, and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, v is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, and nothing is printed.**
