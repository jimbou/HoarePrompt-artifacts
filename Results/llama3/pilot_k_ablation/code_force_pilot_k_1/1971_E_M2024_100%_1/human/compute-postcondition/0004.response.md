Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 0 and the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ad` has been updated to include a new integer, which is the difference between the second element of list `a` and the first element of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
