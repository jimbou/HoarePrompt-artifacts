Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing two integers: 0 and `ad[1] / bd[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to include a new element, which is the result of dividing the second element of `ad` by the second element of `bd`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
