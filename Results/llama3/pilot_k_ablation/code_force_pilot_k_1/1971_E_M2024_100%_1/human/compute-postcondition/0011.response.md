Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 2 elements, `b` is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, `a_k` = n, `ad` is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, `bd` is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, `i` is 0, `v` is a list with two elements: 0 and ad[0] / bd[0], stdin contains multiple test cases with three lines of input: k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q lines with a single integer d**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of the division of the first element of `ad` by the first element of `bd`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `v` now has two elements: the initial 0 and the result of the division.
