Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `k`, `v` is a list containing a single integer 0.**

In this output state, a new variable `v` is introduced and assigned a list containing a single integer 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and the lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` maintain their original properties.
