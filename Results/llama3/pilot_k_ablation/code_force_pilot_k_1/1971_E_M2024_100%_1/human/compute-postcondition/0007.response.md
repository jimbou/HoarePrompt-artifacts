Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing `k+1` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 0 and the second integer is `b[1] - b[0]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated to include the difference between the first two elements of `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
