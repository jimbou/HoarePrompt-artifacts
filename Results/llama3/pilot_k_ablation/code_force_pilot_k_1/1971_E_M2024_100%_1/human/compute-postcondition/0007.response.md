Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, `b` is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 and b has at least 2 elements, `a_k` = n, `ad` is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, `bd` is a list with two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is b[1] - b[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with three lines of input: k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q lines with a single integer d.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `bd` now has two elements: the first element is still 0, and the second element is the difference between the first two elements of the sequence `b`, which is `b[1] - b[0]`. The value of `i` is still 1. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
