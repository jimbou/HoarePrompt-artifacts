Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= q <= 10^5, a is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and a has at least 1 element, b is a strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, ad is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, i is k-1, v is a list with k elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is q, ql is an integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, m is an integer equal to b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and m is printed for each iteration, where m is equal to b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s].**
