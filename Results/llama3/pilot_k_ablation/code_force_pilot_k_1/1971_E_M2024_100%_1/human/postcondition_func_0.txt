This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, followed by two sequences of k integers a_i and b_i, and finally q single integers d. It then calculates the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, and the ratios of these differences. For each query integer d, it finds the corresponding value in the sequence b using binary search and prints the result. If d is equal to an element in a, it prints the corresponding element in b; otherwise, it calculates the result using the differences and ratios. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each query.
