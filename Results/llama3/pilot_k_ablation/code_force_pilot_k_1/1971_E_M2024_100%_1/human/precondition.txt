stdin contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, k, and q, followed by a list of k integers a_i, a list of k integers b_i, and q integers d_i. n, k, and q are positive integers, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= q <= 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of positive integers, a_k = n, and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. 0 <= d_i <= n.
