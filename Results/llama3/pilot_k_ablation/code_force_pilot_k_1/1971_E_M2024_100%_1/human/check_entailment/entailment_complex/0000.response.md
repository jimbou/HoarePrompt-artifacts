Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the sequences a and b, and the ratios of these differences. For each query integer d, it finds the corresponding value in the sequence b using binary search and prints the result. If d is equal to an element in a, it prints the corresponding element in b; otherwise, it calculates the result using the differences and ratios. The program processes all test cases and prints the results for each query.

Correctness: **True**
