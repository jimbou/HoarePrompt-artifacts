Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of test cases, the final destination, the number of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries.
2. It correctly calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the distances and times between points, respectively.
3. It correctly calculates the speeds between each pair of points by dividing the distance difference by the time difference.
4. For each query, it correctly finds the corresponding point in the list `a` using binary search (via `bisect_left`) and calculates the time it takes to reach that point by adding the time it takes to reach the previous point and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the current speed.
5. It correctly handles the case where the query point is exactly at one of the known points by printing the corresponding time directly.
6. It correctly prints the results for each query and resets the variables for the next test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
