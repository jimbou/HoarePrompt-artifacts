Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the final destination `n`, the number of points `k`, the number of queries `q`, the list of points `a`, the list of times `b`, and the queries.
2.  It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in lists `a` and `b`, which represent the distances and times between points, respectively.
3.  It calculates the speed of the car between each pair of points by dividing the distance by the time.
4.  For each query, it finds the corresponding point in list `a` using binary search (`bisect_left`) and calculates the time it takes to reach that point by adding the time taken to reach the previous point and the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the calculated speed.
5.  It prints the calculated time for each query.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
