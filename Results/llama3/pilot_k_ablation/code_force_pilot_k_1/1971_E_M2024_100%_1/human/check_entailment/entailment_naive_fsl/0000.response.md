Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach a given point `d` based on the provided sequences `a` and `b`. It first calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` to determine the speed of the car between each pair of points. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the interval in which the query point `d` lies and calculates the time it takes to reach `d` based on the speed of the car in that interval.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `d` is exactly at one of the points in `a`, it returns the corresponding time from `b`.
* When `d` is between two points in `a`, it calculates the time based on the speed of the car in that interval.
* When `d` is outside the range of `a`, it does not attempt to calculate the time, which is correct since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 1, in which case the car travels at a constant speed from point 0 to point `n`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
