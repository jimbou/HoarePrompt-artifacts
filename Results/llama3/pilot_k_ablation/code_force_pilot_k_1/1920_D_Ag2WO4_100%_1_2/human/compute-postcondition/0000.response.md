Output State: **x is an integer representing the number of test cases**.

The initial state of x is a list of integers, where the first integer represents the number of test cases. The code `x = int(x)` converts the first element of the list to an integer, effectively extracting the number of test cases from the list. The rest of the list, which contains the operations and queries, is discarded. The output state reflects this change, where x is now an integer representing the number of test cases.
