Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly handles the two types of operations: appending an integer to the end of the array and appending x copies of the array to the end of the array.

2. The program correctly calculates the size of the array after each operation and stores the size in the list `a`.

3. The program correctly handles the queries by finding the k-th element of the array. It does this by iterating through the list `a` in reverse order and updating the query index `x` based on the size of the array at each step.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the query index `x` is not in the collection `b` by returning the updated `x` value, which is the k-th element of the array.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the array size exceeds 10^19 by skipping the operation and continuing with the next operation.

6. The program correctly prints the answers to the queries in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
