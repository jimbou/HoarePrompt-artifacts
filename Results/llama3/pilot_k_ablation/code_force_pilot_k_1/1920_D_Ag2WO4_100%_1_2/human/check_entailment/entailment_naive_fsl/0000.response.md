Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index is greater than the size of the array after all operations. In this case, the program should return an error or handle it in some way, but instead, it will produce incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will produce incorrect results for queries 14, 15, 16, and 20, because these indices are greater than the size of the array after all operations.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly.
