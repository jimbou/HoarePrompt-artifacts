Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by initializing an empty array `a` and an empty dictionary `b`. The array `a` will store the sizes of the array after each operation, and the dictionary `b` will store the values appended to the array.

2. The program then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It iterates over each operation, reading the type of operation `d` and the value `e`.

3. If the operation is of type 1 (appending an integer), the program increments the last element of array `a` by 1 and stores the value `e` in dictionary `b` with the current size of `a` as the key.

4. If the operation is of type 2 (appending copies of the array), the program appends a new element to array `a` with the value of the last element multiplied by `e + 1`. This represents the new size of the array after appending copies.

5. After all operations are processed, the program reverses array `a` to get the sizes of the array in reverse order.

6. The program then reads the queries and applies a function `func_1` to each query. The function `func_1` takes a query `x` and finds the corresponding value in the array.

7. If `x` is in dictionary `b`, the function returns the value stored in `b`. Otherwise, it iterates over the sizes in array `a` in reverse order, subtracting 1 from `x` and taking the modulus of the current size until it finds a size that is in dictionary `b`. It then returns the value stored in `b` for that size.

8. Finally, the program prints the results of applying `func_1` to each query.

Correctness: **True**
