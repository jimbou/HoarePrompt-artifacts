Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list containing one non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, `end` is 1000000000, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `start` is either less than or equal to `v` or its original value if `t` was not 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include one non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, which is the value of `v`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `start` is either less than or equal to `v` or its original value if `t` was not 1, as specified in the initial state.
