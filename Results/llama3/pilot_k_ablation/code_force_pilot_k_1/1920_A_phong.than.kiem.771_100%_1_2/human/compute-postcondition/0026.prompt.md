You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and the next n lines of stdin contain two space-separated integers, t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000.
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `stdin` is empty.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `stdin` is empty.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, and the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, and less than or equal to the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, if the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1 is less than or equal to the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, otherwise it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, and the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, and less than or equal to the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, if the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1 is less than or equal to the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, otherwise it returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
