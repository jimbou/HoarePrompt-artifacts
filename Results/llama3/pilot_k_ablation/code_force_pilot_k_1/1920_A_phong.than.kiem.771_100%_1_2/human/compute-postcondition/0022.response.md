Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000 that must have at least 1 element, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `count_num` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element of the list `num`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `num` still contains non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000, and `i` is still the first element of this list, within the range of `start` and `end`. The input stream `stdin` is still empty.
