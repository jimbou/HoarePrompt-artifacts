Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000 that must have at least 1 element, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `count_num` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element of the list `num`. The current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop, because the `continue` statement is used. The values of the variables `n`, `num`, `start`, `end`, `count_num`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same.
