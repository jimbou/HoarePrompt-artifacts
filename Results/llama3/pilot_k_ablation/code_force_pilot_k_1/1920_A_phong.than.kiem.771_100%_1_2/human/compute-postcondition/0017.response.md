Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `count_num` is 0, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_num` has been initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `num`, `start`, `end`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
