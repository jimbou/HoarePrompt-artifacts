Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000 that must have at least 1 element, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `stdin` is empty. If the first element `i` of the list `num` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, then `count_num` is 0 and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 and `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`.***
