Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `t` is 1, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `i` is 0. The current value of `start` is equal to the current value of `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `start` is now equal to the current value of `v`, indicating that `start` has been updated to the value of `v`.
