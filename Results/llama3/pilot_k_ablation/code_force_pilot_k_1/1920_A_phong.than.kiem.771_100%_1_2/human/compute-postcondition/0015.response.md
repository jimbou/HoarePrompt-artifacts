Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `num` is either an empty list or a list containing one non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `i` is 0, `t` is either 3 or its original value if `t` was not 3, `end` is 1000000000, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `start` is either less than or equal to `v` or its original value if `t` was not 1. If `t` is 3, then `num` contains one non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. Otherwise, `num` remains an empty list.***
