Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `t` is an integer in {1,2,3}, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `i` is 0. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is updated to be equal to `v`. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, `stdin`, `t`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
