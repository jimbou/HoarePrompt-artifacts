Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `end` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `t` is 2, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition "If `t` was 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then the current value of `start` is equal to `v`, otherwise the current values of `start`, `end`, `num`, `stdin`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged" is not applicable here because `t` is 2, so the value of `start` is not affected.
