The code snippet reads the value of `n` from stdin, which is a positive integer. The initial value of `n` is overwritten by this input. The code then initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0 (which is equivalent to 1,000,000,000). The `num` list is initialized as an empty list.

The code does not modify the values of `t` and `v` from the stdin, as they are not used in the code snippet. The next `n` lines of stdin, which contain two space-separated integers `t` and `v`, are not read or processed by the code.

Output State: **n is a positive integer read from stdin, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines of two space-separated integers each, t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000.**
