Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `t` is an integer in {1,2,3}, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `t` is now an integer in {1,2,3} and the value of `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, which were read from the first line of the input. The stdin now contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, as one line has been read.
