Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `end` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines of two space-separated integers each, `t` is 2, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `i` is 0. If `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to be less than or equal to `v`.***
