This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where each input consists of a type (1, 2, or 3) and a value. It uses the type 1 inputs to determine a start value and the type 2 inputs to determine an end value. It then counts the number of type 3 inputs that fall within the range defined by the start and end values. Finally, it returns the size of the range minus the count of type 3 inputs that fall within the range, or 0 if the start value is greater than the end value.
