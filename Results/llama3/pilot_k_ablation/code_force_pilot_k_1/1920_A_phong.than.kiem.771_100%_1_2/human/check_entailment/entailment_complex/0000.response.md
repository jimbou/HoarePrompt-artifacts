Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the constraints, and calculates the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints. The program handles the three types of constraints (greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, and not equal to) correctly and updates the start and end values accordingly. It also correctly counts the number of type 3 inputs that fall within the range defined by the start and end values. Finally, it returns the size of the range minus the count of type 3 inputs that fall within the range, or 0 if the start value is greater than the end value. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
