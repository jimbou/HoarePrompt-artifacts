Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value.
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value that is entered by the user, and the value of `isOne` remains False.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1, regardless of the value of the boolean variable isOne.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns an integer value based on the input boolean `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it prompts the user to enter an integer value and returns it. If `isOne` is True, it returns the number 1. The function does not modify the input boolean `isOne`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value, to_int is a boolean value.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string. If `space` is true, `items` is a list of strings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, `items` is a list of characters in the string `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is true, the list contains integers converted from the substrings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, the list contains integers converted from the individual characters in the string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings or characters. If `space` is true, the list contains strings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, the list contains individual characters from the string `line`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, it splits the input line into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the input line as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers; otherwise, it returns them as strings or characters. The function returns a list of integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values of any type and sym is a string.
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of values of any type, `sym` is a string, `string` is a string that contains all elements of `arr` converted to strings, separated by `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that contains all elements of the list `arr` converted to strings, separated by the string `sym`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of values and a separator string as input, converts each value in the list to a string, and returns a single string containing all the converted values separated by the specified separator.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)

    #State: `indices` is a list of all indices of occurrences of `substring` in `string`, `index` is -1, `string` is a string, `substring` is a string
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of all indices of occurrences of substring in string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns all occurrences of a given substring within a string by their indices. It takes a string and a substring as input, searches for the substring within the string, and returns a list of indices where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify the original string or substring.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values and element is a value of any type such that element is present in arr.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the element is found in the list 'arr'. The indices are the positions of the element in the list, and the list contains all the indices where the element is present. The element is a value of any type that is present in the list 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It accepts a list and an element as input, and returns a list of indices where the element is found. If the element is present multiple times in the list, all corresponding indices are included in the output. If the element is not found in the list, an empty list is returned.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is any type of value.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists, `index` is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and `value` is any type of value. Either the loop found a sub-array where the element at `index` is equal to `value` and returned that sub-array, or it iterated through all sub-arrays without finding a match and did not return anything.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that the loop iterated through all sub-arrays in the list 'arr' without finding a sub-array where the element at the specified 'index' is equal to the given 'value'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for a sub-array within a given list of lists (`arr`) where the element at a specified `index` matches a given `value`. If a match is found, it returns the entire sub-array. If no match is found after iterating through all sub-arrays, it returns `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and the next n lines of stdin contain two space-separated integers, t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000.
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000000000, `start` is the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `stdin` is empty.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, and the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1, and less than or equal to the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, if the maximum of the initial value -1 and the minimum of the values associated with type 1 is less than or equal to the minimum of the initial value 1000000000 and the maximum of the values associated with type 2, otherwise it returns 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where each input consists of a type (1, 2, or 3) and a value. It uses the type 1 inputs to determine a start value and the type 2 inputs to determine an end value. It then counts the number of type 3 inputs that fall within the range defined by the start and end values. Finally, it returns the size of the range minus the count of type 3 inputs that fall within the range, or 0 if the start value is greater than the end value.
