This function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, it splits the input line into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the input line as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers; otherwise, it returns them as strings or characters. The function returns a list of integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
