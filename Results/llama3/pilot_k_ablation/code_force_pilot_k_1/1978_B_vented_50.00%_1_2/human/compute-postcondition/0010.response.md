Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n times a is being printed. If a is less than b, the profit is updated to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed.***
