The code prints the calculated profit, which is the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, where a is less than b, and n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, and t is greater than 0.
Output: **the calculated profit (where profit is the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2)**
