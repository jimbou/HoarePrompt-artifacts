The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first test case is consumed by this line of code. The value of `t` is now equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
