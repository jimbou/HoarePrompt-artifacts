Output State: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and a is less than b**
