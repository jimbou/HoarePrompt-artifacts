Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` is being printed. If `a` is less than `b`, the profit is updated to the product of `n` and `a` plus (`b` - `a`) * (min(`n` - 1, `b` - `a`) + 1) - min(`n` - 1, `b` - `a`) * (min(`n` - 1, `b` - `a`) + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decreased by 1, and it is still greater than 0. The number of test cases in the standard input has been reduced by one. The values of `x`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The profit calculation and printing conditions also remain the same.
