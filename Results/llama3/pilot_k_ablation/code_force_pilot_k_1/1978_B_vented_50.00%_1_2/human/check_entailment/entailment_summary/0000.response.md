Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b).

3. It calculates the initial profit by multiplying the number of buns (n) with the usual price of a bun (a).

4. If the usual price of a bun (a) is greater than or equal to the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b), it simply prints the initial profit. This is because selling the buns at the usual price would result in a higher profit.

5. If the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b) is greater than the usual price of a bun (a), it calculates the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price (k). The optimal value of k is the minimum of (b - a) and (n - 1).

6. It then calculates the additional profit by selling k buns at the modified price. The additional profit is calculated as (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2.

7. Finally, it prints the total profit, which is the sum of the initial profit and the additional profit.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns.

Correctness: **True**
