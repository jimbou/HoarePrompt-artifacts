To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `results` since it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty, meaning it must have at least one element. Therefore, the state of `results` needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `idx` is 2 * t + 1, `data` is a list of strings, where the first element is the string representation of t. `results` is a list of at least one value, where each value is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`.**
