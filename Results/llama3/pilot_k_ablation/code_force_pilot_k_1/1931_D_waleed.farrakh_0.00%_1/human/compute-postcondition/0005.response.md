To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `results` because it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `results` must have at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1 + 2 * t, results is returned by func_1(test_cases) and must have at least one element**
