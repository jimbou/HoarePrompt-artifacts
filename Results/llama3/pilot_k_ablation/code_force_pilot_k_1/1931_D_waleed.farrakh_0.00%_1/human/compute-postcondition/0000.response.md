Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code reads the input from stdin and splits it into lines, storing it in the `data` variable. It then converts the first line to an integer and assigns it to `t`. The `test_cases` list is initialized as an empty list. The `idx` variable is set to 1. No other variables are affected.
