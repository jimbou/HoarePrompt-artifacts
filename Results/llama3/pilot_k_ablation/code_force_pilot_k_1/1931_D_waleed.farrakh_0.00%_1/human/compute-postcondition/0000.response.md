Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer equal to the first line of data. idx is an integer equal to 1. data is a list of strings, where the first element is the string representation of t. input is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**

In this output state, the code has read the first line of data from sys.stdin and converted it to an integer, which is stored in the variable t. The variable idx is set to 1, indicating that the next line of data to be processed is the second line. The variable data is a list of strings, where the first element is the string representation of t. The variable input is a function that reads from sys.stdin. The variable test_cases is still an empty list, waiting to be populated with tuples containing n, x, y, and arr.
