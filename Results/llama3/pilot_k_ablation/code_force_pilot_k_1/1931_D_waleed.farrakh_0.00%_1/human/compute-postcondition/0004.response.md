Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1 + 2 * t, results is returned by func_1(test_cases).**

The code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `test_cases` and assigns the returned value to the variable `results`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so the exact value of `results` cannot be determined. However, it is known that `results` is the return value of `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as an argument.
