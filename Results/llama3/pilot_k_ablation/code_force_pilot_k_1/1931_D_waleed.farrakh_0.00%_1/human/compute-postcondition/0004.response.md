Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `idx` is 2 * t + 1, `data` is a list of strings, where the first element is the string representation of t. `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, which is a list of t values, where each value is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `results` variable now holds the output of the `func_1` function applied to each tuple in the `test_cases` list. The other variables, `test_cases`, `idx`, and `data`, remain unchanged. The `results` variable now contains a list of values, where each value is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding input tuple in `test_cases`.
