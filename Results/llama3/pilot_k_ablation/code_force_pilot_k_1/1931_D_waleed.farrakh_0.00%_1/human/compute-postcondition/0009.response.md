Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four values: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes these test cases and returns a list of results. The function then prints each result from the returned list. The function does not modify the input test cases or any other external state. Its sole purpose is to process the input test cases and produce output based on the results.**
