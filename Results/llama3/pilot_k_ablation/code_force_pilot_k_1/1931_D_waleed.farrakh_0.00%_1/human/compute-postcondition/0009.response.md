Functionality: **This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function applies an unspecified operation (func_1) to each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case. The results are then printed to the console. The function does not modify the original test cases or any other input variables.**
