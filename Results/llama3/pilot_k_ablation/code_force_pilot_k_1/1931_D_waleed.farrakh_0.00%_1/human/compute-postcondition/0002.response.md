Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer and must be greater than 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 3, _ is 0**

The code block modifies the initial state by adding a new tuple to the `test_cases` list and incrementing the `idx` variable. The first line extracts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the string at index `idx` in the `data` list and assigns them to the corresponding variables. The second line extracts a list of integers `arr` from the string at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list. The third line appends a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list. The fourth line increments the `idx` variable by 2. The variable `_` remains unchanged.
