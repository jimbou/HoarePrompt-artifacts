Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t must be greater than 0, idx is 3, data is a list of strings, where the first element is the string representation of t. input is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**

The code block executes the following operations:

1. It reads the second element of the `data` list (at index 1), splits it into three integers using the `split()` method, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively.

2. It reads the third element of the `data` list (at index 2), splits it into a list of integers using the `split()` method, and assigns it to the variable `arr`.

3. It appends a tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list.

4. It increments the value of `idx` by 2.

After executing these operations, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `test_cases` now contains an additional tuple with the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
* `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned the values read from the second element of the `data` list.
* `arr` has been assigned the list of integers read from the third element of the `data` list.
* `idx` has been incremented by 2, so its new value is 3.
* The `data` list remains unchanged, except that its first element is still the string representation of `t`.
* The `input` function remains unchanged, still reading from `sys.stdin`.

Note that the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not specified in the output state, as they depend on the specific input data. However, their types and relationships are preserved.
