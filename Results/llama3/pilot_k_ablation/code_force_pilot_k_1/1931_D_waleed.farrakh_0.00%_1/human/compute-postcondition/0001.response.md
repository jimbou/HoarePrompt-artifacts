To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer and must be greater than 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1, `_` is 0**
