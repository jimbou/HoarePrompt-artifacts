To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the state of `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `data` is a list of strings, where the first element is the string representation of `t`. `input` is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**
