Functionality: This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and modulo y, and counting the number of pairs that have the same remainder modulo x and modulo y. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the sum of the products of the counts of each remainder modulo x and modulo y for each test case.
