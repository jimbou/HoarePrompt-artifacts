The code prints the value of `result`, which is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. Since the exact `test_cases` and `func_1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`.

Output: **result (where result is the result of applying func_1 to the corresponding tuple in test_cases)**
