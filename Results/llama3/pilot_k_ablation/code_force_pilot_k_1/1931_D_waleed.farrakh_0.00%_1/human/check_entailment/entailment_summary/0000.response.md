Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the numbers in arr, calculating the remainders when divided by x and y, and counting the products of these remainders. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total count of these products for each test case.

func_2 reads input from the standard input, processes the input data into test cases, and applies func_1 to each test case. The results are then printed to the console.

The given program correctly implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the remainders when divided by x and y, counts the products of these remainders, and returns the total count for each test case. The program also correctly reads input from the standard input and processes the input data into test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
