Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Function 1 (func_1) takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and modulo y, and counting the number of pairs that have the same remainder modulo x and modulo y. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the sum of the products of the counts of each remainder modulo x and modulo y for each test case.

Function 2 (func_2) reads input from the standard input, processes the input into test cases, and then calls Function 1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array. It correctly calculates the remainder of each integer modulo x and modulo y, and counts the number of pairs that have the same remainder modulo x and modulo y. The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading input from the standard input and printing the results.

Correctness: **True**
