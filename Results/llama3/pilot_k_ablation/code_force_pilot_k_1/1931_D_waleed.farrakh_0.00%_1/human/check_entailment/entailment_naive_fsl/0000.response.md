Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The provided program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the array itself. func_1 iterates over each test case, initializes two dictionaries (mod_x and mod_y) to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y, respectively, and a count variable to store the number of beautiful pairs.

For each element in the array, the program calculates the remainder when the element is divided by x (rem_x) and the remainder when the element is divided by y (rem_y). It then increments the count by the product of the number of elements that have the same remainder when divided by x and the number of elements that have the same remainder when divided by y. This is because for each element with remainder rem_x, there are mod_x[rem_x] elements that can form a beautiful pair with it, and for each element with remainder rem_y, there are mod_y[rem_y] elements that can form a beautiful pair with it.

Finally, the program returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to calculate the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
