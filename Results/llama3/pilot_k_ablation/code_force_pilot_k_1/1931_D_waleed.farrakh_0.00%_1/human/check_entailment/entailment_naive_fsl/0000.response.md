Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), the favorite integers x and y, and the array itself. It then iterates over each test case, initializes two dictionaries (mod_x and mod_y) to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y, respectively, and a count variable to store the number of beautiful pairs.

For each element in the array, it calculates the remainder when divided by x (rem_x) and the remainder when divided by y (rem_y). It then increments the count by the number of elements in the array that have the same remainder when divided by x and the same remainder when divided by y. This is done by checking if the remainder is already present in the mod_x and mod_y dictionaries, and if so, incrementing the count by the number of times it appears.

Finally, it appends the count to the results list and returns the list.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to calculate the results. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases. It correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array and handles cases where the array elements are not divisible by x or y.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
