Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the array itself (arr).

func_1 initializes two dictionaries, mod_x and mod_y, to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y, respectively. It then iterates over the array elements, calculating the remainder of each element when divided by x and y. For each element, it checks if the remainder is already present in the mod_x and mod_y dictionaries. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs by the product of the counts of the remainder in mod_x and mod_y. It then updates the mod_x and mod_y dictionaries with the new remainder counts.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to calculate the results. It then prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic for finding beautiful pairs. The use of dictionaries to store the remainder counts allows for efficient lookup and updating of the counts, resulting in a time complexity of O(n) for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The line `count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)` is incorrect. The `and` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator, so this line is equivalent to `count += (mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0))`, which is not the intended behavior. The correct line should be `count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) * mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)`.

Correctness: **False**
