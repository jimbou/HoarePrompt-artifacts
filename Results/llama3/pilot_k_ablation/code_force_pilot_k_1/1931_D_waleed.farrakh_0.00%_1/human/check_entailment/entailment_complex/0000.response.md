Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices is considered beautiful if the sum of the elements at those indices is divisible by x and the difference of the elements at those indices is divisible by y.

Function 1 is the core of the program, and it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs. It uses two dictionaries, mod_x and mod_y, to keep track of the remainders of the elements in the array modulo x and modulo y, respectively. It then iterates through the array, calculating the remainder of each element modulo x and modulo y, and increments the count of beautiful pairs if the remainder modulo x is the same as the remainder modulo y.

Function 2 is responsible for reading the input data, processing the test cases, and printing the results. It correctly reads the input data, constructs the test cases, and calls Function 1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results returned by Function 1.

The program correctly handles the input data, processes the test cases, and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
