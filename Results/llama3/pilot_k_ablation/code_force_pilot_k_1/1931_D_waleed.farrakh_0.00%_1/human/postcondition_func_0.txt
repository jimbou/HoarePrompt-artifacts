This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the numbers in arr, calculating the remainders when divided by x and y, and counting the products of these remainders. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total count of these products for each test case. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
