Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
â€” the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `i` is the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `i`, `r` is `k` if `n` is 0, otherwise `r` is `k` minus the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `n`, `i` is `n+1`, stdin is empty, and either the program has printed 'NO' and terminated or `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `i` is the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `i`, `r` is `k` if `n` is 0, otherwise `r` is `k` minus the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `n`, `i` is `n+1`, stdin is empty, and either the program has printed 'NO' and terminated or `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program prints 'Invalid input format'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, expecting three inputs: two positive integers n and k, a list of n non-negative integers, and n integers. It then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the input integers corresponding to each non-negative integer in the list. If the sum of these absolute values exceeds k at any point, it prints 'NO' and terminates. If all sums are less than or equal to k, it continues to the end. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value, but its execution results in either printing 'NO' or 'Invalid input format', or silently terminating if all conditions are met.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (t) representing the number of test cases.
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. If the input is not an integer, the program prints 'Invalid input format', otherwise, the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and attempts to execute another function (`func_1`) that many times. If the input is not a valid integer, it prints an error message ('Invalid input format').
