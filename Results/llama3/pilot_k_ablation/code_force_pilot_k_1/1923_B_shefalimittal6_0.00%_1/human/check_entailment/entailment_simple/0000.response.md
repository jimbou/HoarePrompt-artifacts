Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads the input, processes it, and prints the result. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the input for a single test case, processes it, and prints the result. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program correctly handles the input format and processes the data as required by the problem. It calculates the total health of monsters at each position and checks if it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character.

The program also handles invalid input formats by catching `ValueError` exceptions and printing an error message.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
