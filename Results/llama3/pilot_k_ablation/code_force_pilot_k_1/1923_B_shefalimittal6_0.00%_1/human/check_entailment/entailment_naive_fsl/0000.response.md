Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue lies in the way the program handles the input for the positions of the monsters. In the problem description, it is stated that the positions of the monsters can be negative, but in the program, the positions are taken as absolute values and stored in the array `b`. This means that monsters with negative positions are treated as if they were at the same position on the positive side, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:

3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3

The program will treat the first monster as if it were at position 1, instead of -1. This means that the program will not correctly calculate the time it takes for the monsters to reach the character.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the positions of the monsters correctly, taking into account their signs. One possible solution is to use a separate array to store the positions of the monsters, and then iterate over the array to calculate the time it takes for each monster to reach the character.
