A `ValueError` might be triggered at `t = int(input())`. If the input is not an integer, the `ValueError` is raised, and the program prints 'Invalid input format'. Otherwise, the program executes `func_1()` `t` times. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. If the input is not an integer, the program prints 'Invalid input format', otherwise, the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. If the input is not an integer, the program prints 'Invalid input format', otherwise, the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**
