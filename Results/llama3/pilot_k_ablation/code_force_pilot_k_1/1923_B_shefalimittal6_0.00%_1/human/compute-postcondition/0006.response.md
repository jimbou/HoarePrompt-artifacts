A `ValueError` might be triggered at `t = int(input())`. If the first line of stdin is not a positive integer, the `ValueError` is raised, and the function prints 'Invalid input format'. Otherwise, the function executes `func_1()` `t` times, where `t` is the positive integer from the first line of stdin. Therefore, the output state is: stdin is empty, and the function func_1() has been executed `t` times if the first line of stdin is a positive integer, otherwise, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and the state is unknown.
Output State: **stdin is empty, and the function func_1() has been executed `t` times if the first line of stdin is a positive integer, otherwise, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and the state is unknown.**
