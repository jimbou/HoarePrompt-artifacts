Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each line contains two positive integers n and k, followed by two lines each containing n integers, and the function func_1() has been executed.**

The code executes the function func_1(), but the function's definition is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes to the state. However, we can conclude that the function has been executed, and the stdin has been reduced by one line since the function has consumed one line of input. The value of `t` remains the same, and the remaining lines in stdin still contain two positive integers n and k, followed by two lines each containing n integers.
