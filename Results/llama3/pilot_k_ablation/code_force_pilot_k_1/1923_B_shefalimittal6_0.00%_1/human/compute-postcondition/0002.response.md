Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet calls the function `func_1()`, which means that the function has been executed and any changes made by the function to the program state have been applied. However, since the function definition is not provided, the exact changes made by the function are unknown. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function has been executed, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.
