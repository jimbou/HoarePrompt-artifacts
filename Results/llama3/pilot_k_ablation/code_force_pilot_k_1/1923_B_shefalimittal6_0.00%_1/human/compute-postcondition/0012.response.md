Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x_i)` is incremented by the `i`-th element of `a` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is `k*n - sum(b[1..n])`, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' has been printed and the function has returned, or `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.**
