Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `i` is the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `i`, `r` is `k` if `n` is 0, otherwise `r` is `k` minus the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `n`, `i` is `n+1`, stdin is empty, and either the program has printed 'NO' and terminated or `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.**
