A `ValueError` might be triggered at `n, k = map(int, input().split())`, `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`, or `x = int(input())` if the input cannot be converted to an integer. If the input is valid, the function reads `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` values, and checks if it is possible to distribute the values in `a` among the values in `x` such that the sum of the values in `x` is greater than or equal to `k` times the number of values in `x`. If it is possible, the function prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If the input is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format'.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index abs(x_i) is incremented by the i-th element of a for i from 1 to n, r is k*n - sum(b[1..n]), stdin is empty, and either 'NO' has been printed and the function has returned, or r is greater than or equal to b[i] for all i from 1 to n, or "Invalid input format" has been printed.**
