According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains t lines, each line contains two positive integers n and k, followed by two lines each containing n integers.**
