Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `i` is the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `i`, `r` is `k`, `i` is 1, stdin is empty, and `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`***
