Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t lines, each line contains two positive integers n and k, followed by two lines each containing n integers.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains the remaining input lines, which consist of `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lines each containing `n` integers.
