Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x_i)` is incremented by the `i`-th element of `a` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is initially `k`, stdin is empty, `i` is 1, and the current value of `r` is less than the value at index `i` in list `b`, and 'NO' is printed**
