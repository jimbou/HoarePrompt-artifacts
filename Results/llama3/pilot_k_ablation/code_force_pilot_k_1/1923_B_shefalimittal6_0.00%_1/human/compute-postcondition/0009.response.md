Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `i` is the sum of the absolute values of the input integers that correspond to the non-negative integers in `a` at index `i`, the current value of `r` is less than the value at index `i` in `b`, `i` is 1, stdin is empty, and 'NO' is being printed**
