This function reads input from stdin, expecting two space-separated integers n and k, followed by n space-separated integers a_1 to a_n, and then n space-separated integers x_1 to x_n. It then processes the input to determine if a certain condition is met, printing 'NO' and returning if the condition is not met. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value, but its execution results in either 'NO' or 'Invalid input format' being printed, or no output if the condition is met.
