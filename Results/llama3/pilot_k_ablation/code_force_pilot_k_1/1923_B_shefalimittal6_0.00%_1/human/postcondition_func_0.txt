This function reads input from stdin, expecting three inputs: two positive integers n and k, a list of n non-negative integers, and n integers. It then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the input integers corresponding to each non-negative integer in the list. If the sum of these absolute values exceeds k at any point, it prints 'NO' and terminates. If all sums are less than or equal to k, it continues to the end. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value, but its execution results in either printing 'NO' or 'Invalid input format', or silently terminating if all conditions are met.
