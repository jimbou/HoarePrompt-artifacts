#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, then n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and finally n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n. n and k are positive integers, a_i and x_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and -n <= x_i <= n and x_i != 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, expecting two space-separated integers n and k, followed by n space-separated integers a_1 to a_n, and then n space-separated integers x_1 to x_n. It then processes the input to determine if a certain condition is met, printing 'NO' and returning if the condition is not met. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value, but its execution results in either 'NO' or 'Invalid input format' being printed, or no output if the condition is met.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a sequence of lines, the first line contains a positive integer t, each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and k, followed by two lines each containing n integers.
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: `t` is 0, stdin is empty, and the function func_1() has been executed `t` times.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: stdin is empty, and the function func_1() has been executed `t` times if the first line of stdin is a positive integer, otherwise, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and the state is unknown.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains a positive integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and k, followed by two lines each containing n integers. It then executes the function func_1() t times. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process the input lines and execute func_1() accordingly.
