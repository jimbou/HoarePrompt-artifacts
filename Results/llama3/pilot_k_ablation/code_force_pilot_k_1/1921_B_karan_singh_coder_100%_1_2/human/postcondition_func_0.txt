This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings s and t of length n. It calculates the maximum difference between the number of positions where s is greater than t and the number of positions where s is less than t for each test case, and prints this maximum difference. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty after execution.
