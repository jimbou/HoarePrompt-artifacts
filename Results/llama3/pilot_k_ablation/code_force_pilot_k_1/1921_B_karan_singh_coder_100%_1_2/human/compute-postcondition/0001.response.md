Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0, b is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the 3 inputs read**.

The code reads three inputs from stdin: an integer `n`, and two strings `s` and `t`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `t` are determined by the inputs provided. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin is modified as three inputs are read from it.
