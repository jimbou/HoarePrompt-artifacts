The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input from stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input from stdin has at least 1 test case, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input from stdin must have at least 1 test case and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
