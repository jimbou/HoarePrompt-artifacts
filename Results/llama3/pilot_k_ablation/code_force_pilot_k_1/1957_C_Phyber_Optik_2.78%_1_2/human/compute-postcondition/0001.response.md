The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, dp is a list with dp[1] equal to 1 and dp[2] equal to 3, n is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 3 and i is now 3. 
State: **dp is a list with dp[1] equal to 1 and dp[2] equal to 3, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, i is 3**
