Output State: **dp is a list with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3 and dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, i is 3**

In this output state, the value of dp[3] is calculated using the given formula, where dp[2] is 3 and dp[1] is 1. The values of n and i remain unchanged.
