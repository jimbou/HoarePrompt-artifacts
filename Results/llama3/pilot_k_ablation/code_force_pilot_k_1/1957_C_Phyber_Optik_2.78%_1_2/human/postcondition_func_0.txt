This function calculates and populates a list `dp` with values based on a recursive formula, where `dp[i]` is calculated using the previous two values `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, and the current index `i`. The function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list `dp` of length `n+1`, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `n` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % 1000000007`. The final state of the program is a populated list `dp` with the calculated values.
