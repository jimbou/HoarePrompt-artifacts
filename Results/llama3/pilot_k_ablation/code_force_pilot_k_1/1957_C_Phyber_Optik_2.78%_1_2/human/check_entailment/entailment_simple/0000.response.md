Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves.

The program first initializes a list dp of size 300007 with all elements as -1. Then it calls the function func_1(300000) which is not shown in the given code snippet, but based on the state of the program before and after the function call, it seems that this function calculates the values of dp[i] for i from 1 to 300000 using dynamic programming.

The dp[i] represents the number of possible final configurations of an i x i chessboard. The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3. For i >= 3, the number of possible final configurations is calculated as (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007.

After calculating the dp values, the program reads the number of test cases t. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves k. It then reads the k moves and stores the rows and columns of the moves in a set invalid.

Finally, the program prints the number of possible final configurations for the remaining valid positions on the chessboard, which is dp[n - len(invalid)].

Correctness: **True**
