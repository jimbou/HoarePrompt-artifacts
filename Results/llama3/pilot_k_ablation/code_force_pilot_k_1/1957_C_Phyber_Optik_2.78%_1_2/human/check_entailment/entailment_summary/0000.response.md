Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1(n)` calculates and populates the list `dp` with the correct values based on the recursive formula. The main part of the program then uses these pre-calculated values to efficiently calculate the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

The program correctly handles the base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, and then calculates the values for `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `n` using the recursive formula. The use of the modulo operator (`% 1000000007`) ensures that the calculated values do not exceed the maximum limit.

The main part of the program correctly reads the input, calculates the number of invalid positions, and then uses the pre-calculated values in the `dp` list to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2.

Therefore, the given program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
