Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to determine the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard, given that we have already played k moves and the computer has mirrored these moves. The game continues until there are no valid moves remaining.

The program provided uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a dp array of size 300007, where dp[i] represents the number of different final configurations possible for a chessboard of size i. The function func_1(n) calculates the values of dp[i] for i from 1 to n.

The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3, which represent the number of different final configurations possible for a 1x1 and 2x2 chessboard, respectively.

For i greater than or equal to 3, the program calculates dp[i] using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for a chessboard of size i, we can either place a white rook in the first row and a black rook in the first column (which gives us dp[i - 1] possibilities), or we can place a white rook in the first row and a black rook in any of the remaining i - 1 columns (which gives us 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] possibilities).

The program then reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves already played k, followed by k pairs of integers representing the moves.

For each test case, the program calculates the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would result in two rooks attacking each other) and stores them in a set. It then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the given chessboard and moves.

Correctness: **True**
