Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for each possible number of remaining squares on the chessboard.

The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of configurations for a chessboard of size n x n. It uses the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which is derived from the fact that for each remaining square, there are two possibilities: either place a white rook on that square and a black rook on the mirrored square, or place a white rook on the mirrored square and a black rook on the original square. The `dp[i - 1]` term accounts for the case where the current square is not used, and the `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` term accounts for the case where the current square is used.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid squares (i.e., squares that have already been occupied by a rook), and then prints the number of configurations for the remaining squares using the precomputed `dp` array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
