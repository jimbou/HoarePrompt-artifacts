Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves, taking into account the mirroring of moves by the computer.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each size of the chessboard from 1 to n. The dynamic programming approach is correct, as it breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems and stores the solutions to these sub-problems to avoid redundant computation.

The base cases for the dynamic programming are correctly handled, with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3. The recursive formula for calculating dp[i] is also correct, as it takes into account the number of ways to place a white rook on the current row, and the number of ways to place a black rook on the current column.

The program also correctly handles the mirroring of moves by the computer, by only considering the rows and columns that have not been occupied by a rook yet.

The final answer is calculated by printing the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which is the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
