The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `k`, `maxi`, and the sum of the list `l`. The expression is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables involved:

*   `k` is an integer.
*   `maxi` is the maximum of the current value of `c` and the previous maximum value of `c` before it was reset to 0 by a negative element. `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` and the positive parts of the negative elements that do not reset `c` to 0.
*   `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

The expression calculates the result of the given mathematical operations involving these variables and then takes the modulus of the result with 1000000007.

Since the exact values of `k`, `maxi`, and the elements in `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the mathematical expression.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is an integer, maxi is the maximum of the current value of c and the previous maximum value of c before it was reset to 0 by a negative element, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
