The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. Since `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` and the positive parts of the negative elements that do not reset `c` to 0, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` before it was reset to 0 by a negative element, the new value of `maxi` will be the maximum of these two values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` and the positive parts of the negative elements that do not reset `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the current value of `c` and the previous maximum value of `c` before it was reset to 0 by a negative element, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**
