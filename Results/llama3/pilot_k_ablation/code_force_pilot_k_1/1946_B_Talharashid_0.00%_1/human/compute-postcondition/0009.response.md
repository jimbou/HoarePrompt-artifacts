Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list and the negative elements that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `maxi` is the maximum of the current maximum sum of the positive elements that is less than or equal to the absolute value of a negative element and the sum of the positive elements in the list and the negative elements that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `ele` is the last element in the list. If the list is empty, `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` and its last element `ele` are still the same. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are also unchanged.
