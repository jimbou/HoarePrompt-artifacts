Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list, `c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the list `l`, which is `ele`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele` is still valid.
