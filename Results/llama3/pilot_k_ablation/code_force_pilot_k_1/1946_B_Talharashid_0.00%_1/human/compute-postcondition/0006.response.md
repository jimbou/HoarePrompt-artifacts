Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `c` and the first element in the list `ele`, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `ele` is the first element in the list. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is larger than the absolute value of `ele`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its initial value (which was 0) and the first element in the list `l` (which is `ele`). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is larger than the absolute value of `ele` still holds, but now `c` has a new value.
