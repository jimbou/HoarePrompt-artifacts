According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the ele is the first element in the list.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `ele` is the first element in the list**
