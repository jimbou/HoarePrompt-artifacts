The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. To understand this expression, let's break it down:

* `2 ** k` is the result of raising 2 to the power of `k`, where `k` is an integer.
* `maxi` is the maximum of the current maximum sum of the positive elements that is less than or equal to the absolute value of a negative element and the sum of the positive elements in the list and the negative elements that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements.
* `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
* The expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l))` is then taken modulo 1000000007, which means the result is divided by 1000000007 and the remainder is taken.

Since the exact values of `k`, `maxi`, and `sum(l)` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of this expression.

Output: ** `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list and the negative elements that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `maxi` is the maximum of the current maximum sum of the positive elements that is less than or equal to the absolute value of a negative element and the sum of the positive elements in the list and the negative elements that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `ele` is the last element in the list. If the list is empty, `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0., and this is printed: `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`**
