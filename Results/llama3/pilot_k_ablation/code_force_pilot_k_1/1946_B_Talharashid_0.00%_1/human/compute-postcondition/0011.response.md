Output: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` and the positive parts of the negative elements that do not reset `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the current value of `c` and the previous maximum value of `c` before it was reset to 0 by a negative element, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, and this is printed: (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007, where maxi is the maximum of the current value of `c` and the previous maximum value of `c` before it was reset to 0 by a negative element, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list `l`**
