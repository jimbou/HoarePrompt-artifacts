Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and `k` and the second line to `l`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are determined by the input provided. The variable `c` is initialized to 0, and `maxi` is also initialized to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
