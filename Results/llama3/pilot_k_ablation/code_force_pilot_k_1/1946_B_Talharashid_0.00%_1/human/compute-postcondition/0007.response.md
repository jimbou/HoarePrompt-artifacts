Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If the first element `ele` in the list is less than 0 and the absolute value of `ele` is larger than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `c` and the first element in the list `ele`, and `maxi` is 0.***
