Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original `c` and the original `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, `maxi` is 0, and either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`.***
