Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list and is less than 0, c is 0, maxi is the maximum of the original c and the original maxi.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `c` is reset to 0. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the original value of `c`. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
