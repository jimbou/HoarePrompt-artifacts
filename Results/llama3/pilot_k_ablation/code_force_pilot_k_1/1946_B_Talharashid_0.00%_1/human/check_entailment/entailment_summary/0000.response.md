Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program uses a greedy approach to find the maximum sum.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  It reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the number of operations (k).
3.  It then reads the array of integers.
4.  The program initializes two variables: `c` to keep track of the cumulative sum of non-negative integers and `maxi` to store the maximum sum of non-negative integers encountered so far.
5.  It iterates over the array, and for each element, it checks if the element is negative and if the cumulative sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the negative element. If this condition is true, it updates `maxi` with the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and then resets `c` to 0. If the element is non-negative, it adds the element to `c`.
6.  After iterating over the entire array, it updates `maxi` with the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
7.  Finally, it calculates the result by multiplying `maxi` by 2 raised to the power of `k`, subtracting `maxi`, adding the sum of all integers in the array, and taking the result modulo 1000000007.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
