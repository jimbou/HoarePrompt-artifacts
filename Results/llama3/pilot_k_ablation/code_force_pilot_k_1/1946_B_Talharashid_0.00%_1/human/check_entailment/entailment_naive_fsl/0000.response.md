Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only negative numbers. In this case, the program will always return 0, which is incorrect. The correct solution should consider the maximum sum of subarrays that can be obtained by inserting the sum of the subarray anywhere in the array.

For example, if the input array is [-4, -7] and k = 2, the program will return 0, but the correct answer is 999999996. This is because we can take an empty subarray twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11, modulo 10^9 + 7 this is 999999996.

The program's logic is incorrect because it only considers the maximum sum of subarrays that can be obtained by adding the elements of the subarray, but it does not consider the case where the subarray is empty. The correct solution should consider all possible subarrays, including the empty subarray, and calculate the maximum sum that can be obtained by inserting the sum of the subarray anywhere in the array.
