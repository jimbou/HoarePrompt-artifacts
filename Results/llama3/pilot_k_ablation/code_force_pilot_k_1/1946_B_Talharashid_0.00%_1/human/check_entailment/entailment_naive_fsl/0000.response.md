Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program outputs 17, but the correct output should be 896. The program is not correctly calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

The issue with the program is that it is not correctly calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The program is only considering the maximum sum of the array without any operations, and then adding the sum of the array multiplied by 2^k. This is not correct, as the program should be considering all possible operations and finding the maximum sum.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. This can be done by using a dynamic programming approach, where the program calculates the maximum sum of the array for each possible number of operations, and then returns the maximum sum for k operations.
