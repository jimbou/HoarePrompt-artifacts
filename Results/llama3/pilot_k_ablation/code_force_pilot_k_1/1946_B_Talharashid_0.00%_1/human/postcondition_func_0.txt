This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the maximum sum of non-negative integers and the sum of all integers, then prints the result modulo 1000000007. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and sets variables i, n, k, l, c, and maxi to specific values.
