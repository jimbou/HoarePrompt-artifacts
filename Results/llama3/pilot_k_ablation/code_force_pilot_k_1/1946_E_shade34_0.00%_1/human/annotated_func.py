    #The program returns two values: d, which is the return value of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c is the return value of func_1(b, a % b), a is an integer larger than or equal to b, b is a non-zero integer, and the remainder of a divided by b is not equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero. It performs a series of conditional checks and calculations based on the values of a and b, and returns two integer values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments, and returns the results. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the results with an additional calculation involving the integer division of a by b.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and c are integers and b is a prime number.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of 'a' and 'c' modulo 1000000007, where 'a' is an integer, and 'c' is the first return value of the function 'func_1' with a prime number 'b' and 1000000007 as arguments.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer 'a' and a prime number 'b' as inputs, calls another function 'func_1' with 'b' and 1000000007 as arguments, and returns the product of 'a' and the first return value of 'func_1' modulo 1000000007.
