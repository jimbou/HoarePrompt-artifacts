Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is `d`, which is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The second value is the result of the expression `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is also a return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer not less than `b` and not divisible by `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.**
