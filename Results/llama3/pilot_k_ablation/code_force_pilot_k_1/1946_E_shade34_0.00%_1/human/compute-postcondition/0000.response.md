Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a prime number, `c` is the value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)` for the first return value, `d` is the value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)` for the second return value.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `c` is updated to be the first return value of the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, and a new variable `d` is introduced with the second return value of the same function.
