Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer and non-zero, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, and `a` is less than `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`, respectively. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains the same, with `a` being less than `b`.
