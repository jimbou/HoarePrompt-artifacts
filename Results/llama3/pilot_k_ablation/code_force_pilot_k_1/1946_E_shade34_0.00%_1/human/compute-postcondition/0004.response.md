Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code only assigns the return values of `func_1(b, a)` to `c` and `d`. The relationship between `a` and `b` also remains the same, with `a` being less than `b`. The new variables `c` and `d` are assigned the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, but their exact values are unknown without knowing the implementation of `func_1`.
