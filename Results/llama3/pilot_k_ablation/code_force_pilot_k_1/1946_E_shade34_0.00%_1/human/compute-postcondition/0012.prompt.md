You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer and the value 0 is also an integer and is equal to the initial value of variable b.
    #State: a and b are integers and b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`, which are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` is an integer less than `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and the negation of the difference between the quotient of a divided by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, the quotient a // b is an integer. The difference between this quotient and 1 is then negated, resulting in a negative integer or zero.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is non-zero, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is `d`, which is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The second value is the result of the expression `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is also a return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer not less than `b` and not divisible by `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer and the value 0 is also an integer and is equal to the initial value of variable b.

Case_2: The program returns two values: `d` and `c`, which are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` is an integer less than `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.

Case_3: The program returns two values: 1 and the negation of the difference between the quotient of a divided by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, the quotient a // b is an integer. The difference between this quotient and 1 is then negated, resulting in a negative integer or zero.

Case_4: The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is `d`, which is the return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The second value is the result of the expression `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is also a return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer not less than `b` and not divisible by `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
