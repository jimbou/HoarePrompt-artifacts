You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer, and the value 0 is also an integer and is equal to the current value of variable b.
    #State: a and b are integers, and b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`, which are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0. a is larger than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. Because a is larger than or equal to b, a // b is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the second value is a non-positive integer.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0. a is larger than or equal to b. The remainder of a divided by b is not equal to 0
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns two values: d, which is the return value of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c is the return value of func_1(b, a % b), a is an integer larger than or equal to b, b is a non-zero integer, and the remainder of a divided by b is not equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer, and the value 0 is also an integer and is equal to the current value of variable b.

Case_2: The program returns two values: `d` and `c`, which are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`.

Case_3: The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. Because a is larger than or equal to b, a // b is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the second value is a non-positive integer.

Case_4: The program returns two values: d, which is the return value of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c is the return value of func_1(b, a % b), a is an integer larger than or equal to b, b is a non-zero integer, and the remainder of a divided by b is not equal to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
