Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is not less than `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The condition that `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b` still holds true. The code introduces two new variables, `c` and `d`, which are assigned the return values of the function `func_1(b, a % b)`. The specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
