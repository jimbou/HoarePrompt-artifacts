Output State: **`a` is an integer larger than or equal to `b`, `b` is a non-zero integer, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not equal to 0.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`, respectively. The remainder of `a` divided by `b` is still not equal to 0, as this condition is not affected by the code.
