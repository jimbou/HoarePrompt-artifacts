Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to output the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. However, the provided program does not seem to address this problem at all. It appears to be implementing a modular inverse function using the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is not related to the problem description.

A correct solution to the problem would involve analyzing the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums to determine the possible permutations that satisfy the conditions. The program would need to consider the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums and count the number of valid permutations.

Since the provided program does not address the problem description, it is incorrect.
