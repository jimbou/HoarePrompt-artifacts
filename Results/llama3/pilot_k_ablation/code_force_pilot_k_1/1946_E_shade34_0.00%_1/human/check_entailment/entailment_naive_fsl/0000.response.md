Correctness: **False**.

The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but they are not used to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

The program does not take into account the input values `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{m_1}`, `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{m_2}` and does not produce any output.

To solve this problem, the program should use the given information to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the conditions, and then output the result modulo 10^9 + 7. The provided functions do not seem to be related to this task.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.
