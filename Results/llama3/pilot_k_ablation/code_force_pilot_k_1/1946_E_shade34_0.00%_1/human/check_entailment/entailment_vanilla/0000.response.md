Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program provided uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse and modular multiplication, respectively.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first defines the two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and `func_2` performs modular multiplication using the result from `func_1`.

2. The program then reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases, followed by the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums.

3. For each test case, the program reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

4. The program then calculates the number of suitable permutations using the formula `func_2(n, func_2(m1, func_2(n - m2, 1)))`, where `n` is the length of the permutation, `m1` is the number of prefix maximums, and `m2` is the number of suffix maximums.

5. The program outputs the result modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the modular multiplicative inverse and modular multiplication, and it uses these functions to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not check if the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are consistent with each other. For example, the prefix maximums and suffix maximums should have a common element, which is the maximum element in the permutation. If this common element is not present, the program will still output a result, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
