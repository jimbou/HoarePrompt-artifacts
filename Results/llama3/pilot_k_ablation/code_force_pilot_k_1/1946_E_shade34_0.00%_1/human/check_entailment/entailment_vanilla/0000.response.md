Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of a number. This is used in `func_2` to calculate the modular multiplication of two numbers.

However, the main logic of the program is missing. The program does not seem to be using the input values `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s` to calculate the number of permutations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not being used to solve the problem.

Therefore, based on the provided program, it is not possible to determine the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **False**
