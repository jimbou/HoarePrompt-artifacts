Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Function `func_1` appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the modular multiplicative inverse of a number. This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns two values. The first value is the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`, and the second value is the coefficient of `b` in the BÃ©zout's identity.

Function `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `b` modulo 1000000007. This function takes an integer `a` and a prime number `b` as input and returns the product of `a` and the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo 1000000007.

The main program calculates the number of suitable permutations by iterating over the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and using `func_2` to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of certain numbers. The final result is printed modulo 10^9 + 7.

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm in `func_1` and uses the result to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse in `func_2`. The main program also correctly iterates over the prefix maximums and suffix maximums to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
