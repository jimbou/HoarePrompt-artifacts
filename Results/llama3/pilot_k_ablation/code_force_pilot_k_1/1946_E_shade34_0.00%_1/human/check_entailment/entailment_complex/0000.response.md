Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of a given length, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

`func_1` appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This function is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse, which is necessary for the calculation of the number of permutations.

`func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to calculate the product of two numbers modulo 10^9 + 7. This function is used to calculate the number of permutations.

The main part of the program reads the input, checks if the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are valid, and then calculates the number of permutations using `func_2`. The result is printed modulo 10^9 + 7.

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the necessary mathematical concepts and uses them to solve the problem. The use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular arithmetic is correct, and the program handles the input and output correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
