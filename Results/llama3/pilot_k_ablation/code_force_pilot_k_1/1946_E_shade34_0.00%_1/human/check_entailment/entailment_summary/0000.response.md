Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Function func_1 is used to calculate the modular inverse of a number b modulo 1000000007. It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are then used to compute the modular inverse.

Function func_2 uses the result of func_1 to calculate the product of two numbers a and b modulo 1000000007. It multiplies a by the modular inverse of b (computed using func_1) and returns the result modulo 1000000007.

The main program uses these functions to calculate the number of suitable permutations. It first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If these conditions are not met, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of suitable permutations using the functions func_1 and func_2.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses the functions func_1 and func_2 correctly to calculate the number of suitable permutations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
