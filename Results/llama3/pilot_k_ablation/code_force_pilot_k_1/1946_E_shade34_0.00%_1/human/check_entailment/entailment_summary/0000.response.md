Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program correctly calculates this by iterating through the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, and using the `func_2` function to calculate the combinations.

2. The `func_2` function is used to calculate the combinations, and it correctly uses the modular inverse to avoid overflow. The modular inverse is calculated using the `func_1` function, which is also correct.

3. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match, or where the prefix maximums or suffix maximums are not in increasing order.

4. The program uses the `facts` array to store the factorials, which is correct. The factorials are calculated modulo 1000000007 to avoid overflow.

5. The program correctly prints the result modulo 1000000007.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to perform the necessary calculations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
