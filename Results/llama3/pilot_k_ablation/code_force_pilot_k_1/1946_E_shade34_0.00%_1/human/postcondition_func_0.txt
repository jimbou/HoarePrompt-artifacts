This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero. It performs a series of conditional checks and calculations based on the values of a and b, and returns two integer values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments, and returns the results. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the results with an additional calculation involving the integer division of a by b.
