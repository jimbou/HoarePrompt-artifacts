This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero. It returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the result. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing the first return value of func_1 and the result of subtracting the product of the second return value of func_1, a, and b from the first return value of func_1.
