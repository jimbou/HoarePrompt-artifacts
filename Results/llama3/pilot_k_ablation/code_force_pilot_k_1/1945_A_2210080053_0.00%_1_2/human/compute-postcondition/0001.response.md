Output State: **p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value plus r, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input, file object has at least 1 line, line is the first line in the file object**

The code first assigns the integer values of the first line in the file object to `p`, `q`, and `r`. The second line increments `q` by the value of `r`, updating the value of `q` to be the sum of its original value and `r`. The values of `p`, `r`, stdin, and the file object remain unchanged.
