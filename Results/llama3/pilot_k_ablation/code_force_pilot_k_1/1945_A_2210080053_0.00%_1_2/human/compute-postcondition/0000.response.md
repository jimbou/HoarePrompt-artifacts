According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object. If the file object has at least 1 line, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input. So for the loop to be executed  the file object must have at least 1 line and line is the first line in the file object.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input, file object has at least 1 line, line is the first line in the file object**
