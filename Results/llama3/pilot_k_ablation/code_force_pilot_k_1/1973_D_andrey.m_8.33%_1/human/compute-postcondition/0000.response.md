The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input from stdin and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains one input: a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3), the value of `t` will be a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty**
