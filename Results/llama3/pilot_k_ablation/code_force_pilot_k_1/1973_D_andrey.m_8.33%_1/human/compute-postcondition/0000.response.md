The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains a positive integer first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains no input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains no input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains no input.**
