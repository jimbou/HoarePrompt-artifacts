Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is either `n` or 0, `j` is 1. If `p` is `n`, `func_2(m)` has been called with `m` as an argument. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop does not execute and `p` is 0.**
