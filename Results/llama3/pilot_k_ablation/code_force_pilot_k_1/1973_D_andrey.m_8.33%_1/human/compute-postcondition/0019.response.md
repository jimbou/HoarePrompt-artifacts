Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, max_val * n)`, `m` is 0, `p` is not defined, `j` is not defined. If `func_2` was called, then the loop finished executing and `m` is the value that was passed to `func_2`, otherwise the loop did not finish executing.**
