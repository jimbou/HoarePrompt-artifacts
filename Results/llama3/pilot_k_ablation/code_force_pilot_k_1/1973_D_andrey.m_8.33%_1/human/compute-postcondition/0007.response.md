The only variables in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`, and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` is at least `k`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state to `n` is at least `k` and `i` is `n // k`.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists**
