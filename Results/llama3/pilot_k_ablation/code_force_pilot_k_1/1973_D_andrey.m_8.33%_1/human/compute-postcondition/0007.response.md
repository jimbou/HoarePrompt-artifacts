To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if `n // k` is greater than 0, because the range function generates numbers from `n // k` down to 1.
2. Since `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, we know that `n // k` will be an integer.
3. To ensure the loop executes, we need `n // k` to be at least 1. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
4. The initial value of `i` is 0, but it will be assigned the value of `n // k` at the start of the loop. So, we can adjust the state of `i` to be `n // k`.

Here's the adjusted state:


State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, and `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, max_val * n)`**
