Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, max_val * n)`, `m` is `max_val * (n // k)`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `k` iterations or until `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is `k` if `p` is less than `n` otherwise `j` is the iteration when `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.***
