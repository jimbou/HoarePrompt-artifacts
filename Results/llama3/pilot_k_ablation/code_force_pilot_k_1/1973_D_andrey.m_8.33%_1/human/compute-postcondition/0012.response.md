Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(1, m)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
