Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, and a function named `func_3` has been called and executed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only calls a function named `func_3`, which means that the function has been executed, but its specific effects on the program state are unknown without knowing the function's implementation. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
