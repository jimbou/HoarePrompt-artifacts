Output State: **n is at least k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, or 0 if no such i exists, m is i * max_val, p is 0**

The code assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`, and the value 0 to `p`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `max_val` remain unchanged.
