Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is `func_1(1, m)`, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `p` is now the result of the function call, which is a specific value that depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
