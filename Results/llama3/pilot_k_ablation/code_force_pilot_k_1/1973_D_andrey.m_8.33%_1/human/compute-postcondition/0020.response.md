Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, max_val * n)`, `m` is -1, `p` is not defined, `j` is not defined, and the loop finished executing.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is updated to -1, which is the value passed to `func_2`. The loop finished executing because `func_2` was called. The variables `p` and `j` are still not defined.
