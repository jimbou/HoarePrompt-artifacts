Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is either `n` or 0, `j` is 1. If `p` is `n`, `func_2(m)` has been called with `m` as an argument. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop does not execute and `p` is 0. Additionally, `func_2(-1)` has been called with -1 as an argument.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `func_2(-1)` has been called with -1 as an argument. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged.
