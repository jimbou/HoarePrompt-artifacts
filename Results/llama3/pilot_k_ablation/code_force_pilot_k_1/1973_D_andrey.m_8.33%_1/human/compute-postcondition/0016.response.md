Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, max_val * n)`, `m` is `max_val * (n // k)`, `p` is equal to `n`, `j` is the iteration when `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the return value of `func_2(m)` has been returned.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `r`, `m`, `p`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the function `func_2(m)` has been executed and its return value has been returned.
