Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is either `n` or the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` for `p + 1` equal to `k` if `func_1(p + 1, m)` is less than `n` otherwise `p` is `n` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is 1, `p` is `func_1(1, m)`. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop does not execute and `p` is 0.**
