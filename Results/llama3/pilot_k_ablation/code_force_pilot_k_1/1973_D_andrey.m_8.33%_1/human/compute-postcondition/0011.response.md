Postcondition: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, the current value of `p` is `func_1(1, m)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, and `j` is 1.**
