Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, max_val * n)`, `m` is `max_val * (n // k)`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. The current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
