Functionality: **This function determines the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, and then uses this value to find a suitable `m` that satisfies a certain condition involving `func_1` and `n`. If such an `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)`. If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`. The function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and does not return any value.**
