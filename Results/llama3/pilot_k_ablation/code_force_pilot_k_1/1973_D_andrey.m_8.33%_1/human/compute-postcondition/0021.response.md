Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and attempts to find the largest integer `m` such that `func_1` returns a value less than or equal to `n` when called with `m` as an argument. If such an `m` is found, the function calls `func_2` with `m` as an argument. If no such `m` is found, the function calls `func_2` with `-1` as an argument. The function does not return any value.**
