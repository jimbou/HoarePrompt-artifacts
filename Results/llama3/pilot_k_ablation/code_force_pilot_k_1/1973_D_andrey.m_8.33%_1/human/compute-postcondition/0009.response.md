The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, i is n // k, r is the return value of func_1(1, max_val * n), m is max_val * (n // k), p is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and j is now 1. 
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, i is n // k, r is the return value of func_1(1, max_val * n), m is max_val * (n // k), p is 0, k is greater than 0, j is 1**
