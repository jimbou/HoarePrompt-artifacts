To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `k` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `k` is at least 1.

The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, so we can adjust the state of `k` to reflect this. We can also initialize `j` to 1, as it will be the first value in the range.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1**
