Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with the product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, and then uses this value to find a suitable `m` that satisfies the condition.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search approach and uses the `func_1` and `func_2` functions to interact with the user and find the maximum value of `m`. The program also handles the case where no such `m` exists and calls `func_2(-1)` in that case.

The program is also efficient because it uses a binary search approach, which reduces the number of queries made to the user. The program also uses a loop to call `func_3()` multiple times, which allows it to handle multiple test cases.

However, the program does not handle invalid inputs or errors that may occur during the interaction with the user. For example, if the user enters an invalid input or if the program encounters an error while reading from the input stream, the program may terminate abruptly or produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**, but it can be improved by adding error handling and input validation to make it more robust.

Correctness: **True**
