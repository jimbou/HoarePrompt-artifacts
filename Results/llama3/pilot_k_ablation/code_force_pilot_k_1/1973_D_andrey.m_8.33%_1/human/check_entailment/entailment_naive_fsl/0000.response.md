Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case when the maximum value in the array is not at the beginning of the array. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct maximum value and will return an incorrect result.

For example, if the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and k is 2, the program will first find the maximum value 6 and then try to find a subarray with length 3 and maximum value 6, which does not exist. Therefore, the program will return -1, which is incorrect.

The program should be modified to find the maximum value in the entire array, not just at the beginning, and then try to find subarrays with the correct length and maximum value.
