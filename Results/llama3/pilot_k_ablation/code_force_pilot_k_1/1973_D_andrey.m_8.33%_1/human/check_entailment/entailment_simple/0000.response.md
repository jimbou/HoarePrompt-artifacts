Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest possible value of m. It first finds the maximum possible value of m by calling func_1(1, i * n) for decreasing values of i. Then, it checks for each possible value of m (in decreasing order) whether it is possible to split the array into k subarrays with the desired property. If it finds such a value of m, it calls func_2(m) to output the answer. If it does not find any such value of m, it calls func_2(-1) to output -1.

Correctness: **True**
