Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m. 

The program first finds the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n. This is done by iterating from n to 1 and checking if func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n. If such an i is found, it is stored in max_val.

Then, the program iterates from n // k to 1 and checks if there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m, where m = i * max_val. This is done by calling func_1(p + 1, m) for each j from 1 to k and checking if the returned value is equal to n. If such a sequence is found, the program calls func_2(m) and returns.

If no such sequence is found, the program calls func_2(-1).

The program also correctly handles the case where n is less than k. In this case, the loop in func_3 does not execute and the program calls func_2(-1).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
