Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`.

2. `func_1` takes two parameters `l` and `x` and prints a query in the format `? l x`. It then reads the response from the input, converts it to an integer, and returns the value. This function is used to ask questions about the array.

3. `func_2` takes one parameter `m` and prints a statement in the format `! m`. It then reads the response from the input, converts it to an integer, and asserts that the response is 1. This function is used to print the final answer.

4. `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem. It reads the input, which contains the length of the array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`. It then iterates from `n` to 1 and asks questions about the array using `func_1`. If it finds a value `i` such that `i * n` is a valid query, it sets `max_val` to `i` and breaks the loop. It then iterates from `n // k` to 1 and asks questions about the array using `func_1`. If it finds a value `i` such that `i * max_val` is a valid query and the response is `n`, it prints the final answer using `func_2` and returns. If no such value is found, it prints -1 as the final answer.

5. `func_4` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_3` for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the code, the program seems to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

Correctness: **True**
