The function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer input. For each pair, it prints the integers in non-decreasing order, with the smaller integer first if they are not equal, and the integers in the same order if they are equal. The function does not return any value and only produces output through printing.
