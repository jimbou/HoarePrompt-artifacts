Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of printing the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. The program reads an integer t, which represents the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads two space-separated integers x and y.

The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the integers. If a is greater than b, it prints a followed by b. If a is equal to b, it prints a followed by b (since they are equal, the order doesn't matter). If a is less than b, it prints b followed by a.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for the input integers x and y. The use of the if-elif-else statement ensures that the program prints the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
