Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes two integers x and y as input. It then prints the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- If x is greater than y, it prints x and y in the correct order.
- If x is equal to y, it prints x and y in the correct order.
- If x is less than y, it prints y and x in the correct order.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when x and y are both 0, or when x and y are both 9.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
