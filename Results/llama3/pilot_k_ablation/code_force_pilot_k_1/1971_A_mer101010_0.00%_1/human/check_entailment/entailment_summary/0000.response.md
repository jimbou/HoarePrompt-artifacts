Reasoning:

The program is designed to take two integers as input and output the minimum and maximum of the two integers. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the integers. If a is greater than b, it prints a followed by b. If a is equal to b, it prints a followed by b. If a is less than b, it prints b followed by a.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer input. For each pair, it prints the integers in non-decreasing order, with the smaller integer first if they are not equal, and the integers in the same order if they are equal.

The program does not return any value and only produces output through printing, which is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
