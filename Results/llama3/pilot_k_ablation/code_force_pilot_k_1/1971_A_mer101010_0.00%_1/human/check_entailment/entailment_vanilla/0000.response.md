Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires the program to output the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.
2. The program uses a for loop to iterate through each test case.
3. Inside the loop, it takes two integers a and b as input and checks their values.
4. If a is greater than b, it prints a and b in that order, which is incorrect because it should print the minimum first.
5. If a is equal to b, it prints a and b in that order, which is correct because they are equal.
6. If a is less than b, it prints b and a in that order, which is incorrect because it should print the minimum first.

Correctness: **False**
