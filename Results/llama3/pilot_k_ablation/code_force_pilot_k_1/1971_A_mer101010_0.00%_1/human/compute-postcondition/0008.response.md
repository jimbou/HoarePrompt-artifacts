Based on the initial state, we know that `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, and `a` equals `b`. This means that both `a` and `b` have the same value, which is an integer between 0 and 9.

The print statement is `print(a, ' ', b)`. This will print the value of `a`, followed by a space, and then the value of `b`.

Since `a` and `b` have the same value, the output will be the same integer printed twice, with a space in between.

Output: **[a] [a] (where a is an integer between 0 and 9)**
