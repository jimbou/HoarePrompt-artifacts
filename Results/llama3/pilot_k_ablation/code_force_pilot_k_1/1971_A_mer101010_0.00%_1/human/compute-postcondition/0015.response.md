Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is `n`, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, and stdin is empty. For each pair of integers (x, y) from the original stdin, either "[x] [y]" or "[y] [x]" is printed, depending on whether x is greater than or less than or equal to y.**
