Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, followed by `n` pairs of integers. It then prints each pair of integers in non-decreasing order, either in the original order if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second, or in reverse order if the first integer is less than the second. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the sorted pairs to standard output.**
