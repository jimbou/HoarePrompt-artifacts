The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to make it ready for the loop to execute. Since `i` is the loop counter, it should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `i` is 0**
