The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) as the first input, `n` becomes equal to `t`. The second line initializes a variable `t` to 0.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**
