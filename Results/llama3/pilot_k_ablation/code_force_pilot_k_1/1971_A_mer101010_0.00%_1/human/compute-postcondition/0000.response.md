Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the input is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 100. The second line assigns the value 0 to `t`. No other variables are affected. The remaining lines in the stdin are not modified by the code, so they remain the same.
