Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two space-separated integers from the first line of the input, which are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
