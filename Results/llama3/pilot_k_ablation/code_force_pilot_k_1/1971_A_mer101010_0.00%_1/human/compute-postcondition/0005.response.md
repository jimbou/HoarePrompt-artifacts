Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). The current value of `a` is greater than the current value of `b`, and this is printed: "[a] [b]" where [a] is the current value of `a` and [b] is the current value of `b`.**
