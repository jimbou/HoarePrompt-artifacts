Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed where [a] is the current value of `a` and [b] is the current value of `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, "[a] [b]" is printed where `a` and `b` are equal integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, otherwise "b a" is printed where `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.***
