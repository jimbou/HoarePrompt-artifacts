Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, and stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then "[b] [a]" is printed.***
