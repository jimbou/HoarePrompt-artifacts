The code prints the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9, with `b` being greater than `a`. The output will be the value of `b` followed by a space and then the value of `a`.

Output: **b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9 and is greater than a) ,  (space) , a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 and is less than b)**
