The code prints the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, with `a` being less than `b`. The print statement will output these two values separated by a space.

Output: **b (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive) a (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, where a is less than b)**
