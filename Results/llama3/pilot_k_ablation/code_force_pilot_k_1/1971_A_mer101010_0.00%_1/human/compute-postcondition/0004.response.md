The code prints the current values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9, with a space in between. The current value of `a` is higher than the current value of `b`.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 and is higher than b),   (a space), b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9 and is lower than a)**
