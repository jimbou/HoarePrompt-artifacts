The code prints the current values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, with `a` being greater than `b`. The exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but their relationship is defined.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and is greater than b), b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and is less than a)**
