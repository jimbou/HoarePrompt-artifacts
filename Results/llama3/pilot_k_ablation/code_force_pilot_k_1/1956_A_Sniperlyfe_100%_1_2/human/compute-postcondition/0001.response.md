According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `p` is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, `func_1` is a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers, `results` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, `func_1` is a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `t` must be greater than 0**
