Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, func_1 is a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers, results is a list containing one string, stdin is empty, t is greater than 0, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, qs is a list of integers, res is a list of integers.**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to k and q, then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to p, overwriting the initial value of p. It then reads another list of integers from stdin and assigns it to qs. The function func_1 is called with the new value of p and the result is assigned to remaining_players. A list comprehension is used to create a new list res, which contains the elements of remaining_players at the indices specified in qs. Finally, the string representation of res is appended to the results list. After the code block executes, stdin is empty, and the values of k, q, p, qs, remaining_players, and res are as assigned by the code. The value of t is still greater than 0, and the function func_1 remains unchanged.
