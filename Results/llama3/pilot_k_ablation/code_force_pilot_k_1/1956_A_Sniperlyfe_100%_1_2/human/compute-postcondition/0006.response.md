Output State: **`p` is a list of unique integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100, `max_n` is at least 1, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `max_n` and the rest are zeros, `n` is 1, `cur_n` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `max_n`.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players[n]` has been updated to `cur_n`, which is equal to 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `max_n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
