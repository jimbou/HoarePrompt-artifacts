You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a list of unique integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100.
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
        
    #State: `p` is a list of unique integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[n]` is `n` minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` for all `n` in range 1 to `max_n`, `n` is `max_n`.
    return remaining_players
    #The program returns a list of 101 integers where each integer at index `n` represents the number of players remaining for the game with number `n`, calculated by subtracting the number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` itself, for all `n` in the range 1 to 100.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of 101 integers where each integer at index `n` represents the number of players remaining for the game with number `n`, calculated by subtracting the number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` itself, for all `n` in the range 1 to 100.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
