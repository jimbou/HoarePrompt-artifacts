Output State: **`p` is a list of unique integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[n]` is `n` minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` for all `n` in range 1 to `max_n`, `n` is `max_n`.**
