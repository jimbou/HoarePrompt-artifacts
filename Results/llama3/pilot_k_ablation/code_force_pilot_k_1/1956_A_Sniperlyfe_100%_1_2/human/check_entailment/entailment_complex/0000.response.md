Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and calculates the number of players remaining for each game from 1 to 100, given a list of unique integers representing player positions. The program then uses this information to answer the queries for each test case.

The program uses a binary search approach to efficiently calculate the number of players remaining for each game. It first initializes a list `remaining_players` of size 101, where `remaining_players[n]` represents the number of players remaining for the game with number `n`. It then iterates over the range 1 to 100, and for each `n`, it calculates the number of players remaining by subtracting the number of elements in the list `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` itself.

The program then uses this information to answer the queries for each test case. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the sequence `k`, the number of queries `q`, the sequence `p`, and the queries `qs`. It then applies the function `func_1` to the sequence `p` to get the list `remaining_players`, and uses this list to answer the queries in `qs`.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of players remaining for a game is 0, and it correctly formats the output as a list of strings, where each string contains the answers to the queries for a test case, in the order they were asked.

Correctness: **True**
