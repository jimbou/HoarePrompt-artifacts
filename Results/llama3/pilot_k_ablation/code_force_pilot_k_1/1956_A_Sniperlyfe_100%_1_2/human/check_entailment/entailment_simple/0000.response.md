Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and calculates the number of players remaining for each query.

The key insight is that the number of players remaining after the game is the maximum number of players that can be removed in a single round, which is the minimum of the sequence `p`. The program uses this insight to precompute the number of players remaining for each possible number of players `n` and stores it in the `remaining_players` list.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of players remaining for each `n` by iterating over the range of possible numbers of players and subtracting the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This is done using the `bisect` module to efficiently find the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.

The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` to get the `remaining_players` list, and then uses this list to answer each query. It appends the results to the `results` list and returns it at the end.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and efficiently calculates the number of players remaining for each query.

Correctness: **True**
