Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first defines a function `func_1(p)` that takes a list of integers `p` as input. This function calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100. It uses a while loop to simulate the game rounds and the `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` function to count the number of players that are kicked out in each round.

2. The program then defines a function `func_2()` that reads the input, calls `func_1(p)` to calculate the remaining players for each test case, and appends the results to a list.

3. The program uses a list comprehension to generate the results for each test case. For each query `n` in `qs`, it looks up the corresponding number of remaining players in the `remaining_players` list calculated by `func_1(p)`.

4. The program finally returns the results as a list of strings, where each string represents the number of remaining players for a test case.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the game simulation and calculates the number of remaining players for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
