Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the number of players that would be declared as winners in a game, given a sequence of integers representing player positions and a list of queries representing the number of players in the game initially. The game continues until no one is kicked out of the game in some round, and all the players that are still in the game are declared as winners.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of players remaining for each game from 1 to 100, given a list of unique integers representing player positions. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently determine the number of players remaining for each game.

Function `func_2` takes a series of inputs from the user, including the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes a list of distinct integers in ascending order and a list of queries. It applies `func_1` to the list of integers, then uses the resulting list to answer the queries. The function returns a list of strings, where each string contains the answers to the queries for a test case, in the order they were asked.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly calculates the number of players remaining for each game, and `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to the input data and generates the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
