You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `res` is a string consisting of pairs of identical letters from the English alphabet, except possibly the last character if the initial value of `n` is odd, in which case the last character is a single letter from the English alphabet, and 'YES' has been printed.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: a string consisting of pairs of identical letters from the English alphabet
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `res` is a string consisting of pairs of identical letters from the English alphabet, except possibly the last character if the initial value of `n` is odd, in which case the last character is a single letter from the English alphabet, and an empty string is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin is empty, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 1, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_2: `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `res` is a string consisting of pairs of identical letters from the English alphabet, except possibly the last character if the initial value of `n` is odd, in which case the last character is a single letter from the English alphabet, 'YES' has been printed, and an empty string is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
