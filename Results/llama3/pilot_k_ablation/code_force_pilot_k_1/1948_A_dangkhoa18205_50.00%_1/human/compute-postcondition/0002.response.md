Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50), _ is 0, and the function func_1() has been executed and returned None**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin still contains t-1 integers, as the code does not consume any input. The value of `_` is still 0, as it is not modified by the code. Additionally, the function `func_1()` has been executed and returned None, indicating that it has completed its execution without producing any output or modifying any variables.
