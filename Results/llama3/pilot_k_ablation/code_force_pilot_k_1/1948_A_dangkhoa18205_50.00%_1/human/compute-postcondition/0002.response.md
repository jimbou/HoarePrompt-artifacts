Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 50), and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, but since the definition of this function is not provided, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, we can conclude that the function has been executed, and any changes it makes to the program state are reflected in the output state. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as there is no operation performed on it in the given code.
