Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), 'YES' has been printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, if `n` is larger or equal to 2, `res` is 'AA'. Otherwise, `res` is a string containing the first character of the alphabet (A)**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 0 and 50 (inclusive), 'YES' has still been printed, `letter` is still 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` is still either 'AA' if `n` is larger or equal to 2, or the first character of the alphabet (A) otherwise.
