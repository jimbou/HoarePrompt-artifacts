The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, `res` is a string consisting of two identical letters from the English alphabet if `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), otherwise `res` is 'A' if `n` is 1, and 'YES' has been printed.
