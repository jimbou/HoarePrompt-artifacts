According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 50), which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state does not need to be adjusted either.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 50)**
