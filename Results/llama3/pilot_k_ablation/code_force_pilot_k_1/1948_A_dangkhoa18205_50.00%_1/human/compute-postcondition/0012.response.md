Output State: **n is 1, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 0, res is 'A', 'YES' is being printed**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the character at index `i % 26` of the string `letter` to the string `res`. Since `i` is 0, `i % 26` is also 0, so the first character of `letter`, which is 'A', is appended to `res`. The second line decrements the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` is initially an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and less than 2, it is 1 after the decrement. The value of `letter` remains unchanged, and `i` is not modified. The 'YES' being printed is not affected by the code snippet.
