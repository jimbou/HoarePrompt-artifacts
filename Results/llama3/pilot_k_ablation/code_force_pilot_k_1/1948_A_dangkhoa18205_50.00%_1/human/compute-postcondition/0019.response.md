Functionality: **This function reads an integer input from the user, checks if it is less than or equal to 1, and prints 'NO' if true. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of repeated alphabet characters based on the input value. If the input is even, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice. If the input is odd, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice and appends the first character 'A'. The function then prints the generated string.**
