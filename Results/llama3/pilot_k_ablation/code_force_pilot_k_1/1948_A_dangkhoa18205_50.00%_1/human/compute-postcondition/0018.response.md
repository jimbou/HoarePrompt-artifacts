Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `n` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, and if the initial value of `n` is even, `res` is a string containing the first `n/2` characters of the alphabet (A-Z) each repeated twice. If the initial value of `n` is odd, `res` is a string containing the first `(n-1)/2` characters of the alphabet (A-Z) each repeated twice, followed by the first character of the alphabet (A), and an empty string is printed.**
