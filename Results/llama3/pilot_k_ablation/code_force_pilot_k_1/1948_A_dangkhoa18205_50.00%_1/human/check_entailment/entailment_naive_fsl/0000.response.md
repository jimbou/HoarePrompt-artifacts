Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` correctly handles the case when `n` is less than or equal to 1 by printing 'NO'. For `n` greater than 1, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating each letter twice and moving to the next letter in the alphabet. The function `func_2` simply calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program handles all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases such as `n` being 1 or 2. The use of the modulo operator (`i % 26`) ensures that the program wraps around the alphabet correctly, and the `while` loop ensures that the program continues to add characters to the string until `n` is reduced to 0.

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the required logic, making it correct for all potential cases.
