Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and generates a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and generates the string.

The string is generated by iterating over the uppercase Latin letters and adding them to the result string. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it adds two consecutive occurrences of the same letter to the string, effectively creating two special characters. If `n` is 1, it adds a single occurrence of the letter to the string.

The `func_2` function takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it prints 'NO'.
* If `n` is greater than 1, it generates a string with exactly `n` special characters.
* The string is generated correctly, with each special character being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs, and the correctness is **True**.
