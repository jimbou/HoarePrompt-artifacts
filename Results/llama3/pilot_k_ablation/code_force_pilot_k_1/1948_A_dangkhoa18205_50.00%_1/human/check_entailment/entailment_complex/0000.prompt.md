Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: 'YES' has been printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `n` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, if the initial value of `n` is even, `res` is a string containing the first `n/2` characters of the alphabet (A-Z) each repeated twice, if the initial value of `n` is odd, `res` is a string containing the first `(n-1)/2` characters of the alphabet (A-Z) each repeated twice, followed by the first character of the alphabet (A)
        print(res)
        #This is printed: (an empty string)
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `n` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, and if the initial value of `n` is even, `res` is a string containing the first `n/2` characters of the alphabet (A-Z) each repeated twice. If the initial value of `n` is odd, `res` is a string containing the first `(n-1)/2` characters of the alphabet (A-Z) each repeated twice, followed by the first character of the alphabet (A), and an empty string is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer input from the user, checks if it is less than or equal to 1, and prints 'NO' if true. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of repeated alphabet characters based on the input value. If the input is even, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice. If the input is odd, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice and appends the first character 'A'. The function then prints the generated string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers (1 <= n <= 50).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains 0 integers, _ is t-1, and the function func_1() has been executed t times and returned None.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer `t` from standard input, then reads `t` integers from standard input, and executes the function `func_1()` `t` times, discarding its return value.
