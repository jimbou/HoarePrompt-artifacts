Reasoning: 

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads an integer `n` from standard input and checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of repeated alphabet characters based on the input value. If the input is even, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice. If the input is odd, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice and appends the first character 'A'. The function then prints the generated string.

`func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then executes `func_1` `t` times.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. For each test case, it correctly determines whether it is possible to build a string with exactly n special characters and prints the corresponding string if possible. If not possible, it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
