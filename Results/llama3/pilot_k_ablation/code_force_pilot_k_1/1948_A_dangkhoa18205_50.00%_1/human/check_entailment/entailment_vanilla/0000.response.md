Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and attempts to build a string with exactly `n` special characters. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have a special character with only one character. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string by iterating over the uppercase Latin letters. It adds two consecutive occurrences of each letter to the string, reducing `n` by 2 in each iteration, until `n` becomes 0 or 1. If `n` becomes 1, it adds a single occurrence of the current letter to the string.

`func_2` takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct. It handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 correctly by printing 'NO'. For `n` greater than 1, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by adding two consecutive occurrences of each letter and handling the case where `n` becomes 1.

Correctness: **True**
