Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes an integer n as input and checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints 'NO' because there cannot be a string with exactly n special characters. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string by iterating through the alphabet, adding pairs of the same letter to the string until n is reduced to 0 or 1. If n is odd, it adds a single letter to the string.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly handles the cases where n is less than or equal to 1 and constructs a string with exactly n special characters for larger values of n. The use of the modulo operator (`i % 26`) ensures that the alphabet is cycled through correctly, and the addition of pairs of letters ensures that each pair has exactly one special character.

Correctness: **True**
