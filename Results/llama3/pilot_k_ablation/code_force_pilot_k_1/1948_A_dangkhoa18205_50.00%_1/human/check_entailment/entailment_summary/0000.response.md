Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads an integer input from the user and generates a string of repeated alphabet characters based on the input value. If the input is even, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice. If the input is odd, it repeats the first half of the alphabet (A-Z) twice and appends the first character 'A'. This function meets the problem description as it generates a string with exactly n special characters.

`func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then reads `t` integers from standard input, and executes the function `func_1()` `t` times. This function acts as a test case runner, allowing the program to handle multiple inputs.

Since `func_1` correctly generates a string with exactly n special characters and `func_2` correctly runs `func_1` for multiple test cases, the program as a whole meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
