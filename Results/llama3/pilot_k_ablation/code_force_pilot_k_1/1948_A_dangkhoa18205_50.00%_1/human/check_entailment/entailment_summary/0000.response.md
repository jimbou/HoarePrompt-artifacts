Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads an integer n from standard input and prints 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 1. If n is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of pairs of identical letters from the English alphabet, except possibly the last character if n is odd, in which case the last character is a single letter from the English alphabet.

`func_2` executes `func_1` a specified number of times, where the number of executions is determined by user input, which is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly handles the case where n is less than or equal to 1 and prints 'NO'. For n greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string that meets the condition of having exactly n special characters. `func_2` correctly executes `func_1` the specified number of times.

Correctness: **True**
