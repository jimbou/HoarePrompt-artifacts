This function reads an integer n from standard input and prints 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 1. If n is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of pairs of identical letters from the English alphabet, except possibly the last character if n is odd, in which case the last character is a single letter from the English alphabet. The function then leaves the input stream empty and the variable n set to 0.
