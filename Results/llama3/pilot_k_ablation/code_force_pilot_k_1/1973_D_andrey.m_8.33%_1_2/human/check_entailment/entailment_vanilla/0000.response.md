Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by defining four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`.

2. `func_1` takes two parameters `l` and `x` and prints a query in the format `? l x`. It then reads the response from the input and returns it.

3. `func_2` takes a single parameter `m` and prints an answer in the format `! m`. It then reads the response from the input and asserts that it is equal to 1.

4. `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem. It reads the input `n` and `k` and initializes `max_val` to 0. It then iterates from `n` to 1 and for each `i`, it calls `func_1` with `l = 1` and `x = i * n`. If the response `r` is less than or equal to `n`, it sets `max_val` to `i` and breaks the loop.

5. After the loop, it iterates from `n // k` to 1 and for each `i`, it calculates `m = i * max_val`. It then calls `func_1` with `l = p + 1` and `x = m` in a loop until `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `p` is equal to `n`, it calls `func_2` with `m` and returns.

6. If the loop completes without finding a valid `m`, it calls `func_2` with `-1`.

7. `func_4` reads the input `t` and calls `func_3` in a loop `t` times.

The program seems to be correct and should work as expected. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

Correctness: **True**
