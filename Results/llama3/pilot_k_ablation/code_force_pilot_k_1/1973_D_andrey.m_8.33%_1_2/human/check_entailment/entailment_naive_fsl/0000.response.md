Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. In the function `func_3`, it first tries to find the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, n) = max_val * n`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `max_val` is not found. In this case, it should continue to the next iteration of the loop, but instead, it breaks out of the loop and tries to find a value `m` that satisfies the condition `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m`. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will first try to find `max_val` such that `f(1, 5) = max_val * 5`, but it will not find any such `max_val`. Then, it will try to find `m` that satisfies the condition `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = f(c_2 + 1, 5) = m`. However, it will not correctly handle the case where `m` is not found, and it will output `-1` as the answer, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
