Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n` // `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(1, m)`, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to the value returned by `func_1(1, m)`, where `m` is `i` * `max_val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
