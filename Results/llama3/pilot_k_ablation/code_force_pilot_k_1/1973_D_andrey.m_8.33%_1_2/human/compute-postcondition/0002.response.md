Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and the function `func_3()` has been called and executed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The code only calls the function `func_3()`, which has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified as the function's implementation is not provided. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function has been called and executed, without any changes to the value of `t`.
