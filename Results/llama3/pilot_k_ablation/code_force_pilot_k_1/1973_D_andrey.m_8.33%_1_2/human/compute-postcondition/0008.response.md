Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, i is n // k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, p is 0, stdin contains no input**

The code assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m` and the value of 0 to `p`. Since `i` is `n // k` and `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` becomes `i * max_val`. The value of `p` is set to 0. No other variables are affected.
