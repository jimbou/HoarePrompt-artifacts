To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains no input**
