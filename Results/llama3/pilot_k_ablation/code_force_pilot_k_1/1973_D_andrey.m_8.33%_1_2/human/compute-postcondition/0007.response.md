To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n // k` is greater than 0. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, we can conclude that `n // k` will be at least 1 if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`
* `i` is now `n // k` (since the loop starts from `n // k` and decrements by 1 in each iteration)
* `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4

The states of `max_val` and `stdin` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n // k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `stdin` contains no input**
