Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(j, m)` where `j` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(j, m)` returns a value greater than or equal to `n` or `k` if no such `j` exists, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(j, m)` returns a value greater than or equal to `n` or `k` if no such `j` exists. The current value of `p` is equal to `n`.***
