Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `func_2` has been called with an argument `-1`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `max_val` also remains the same as it is not updated by the code. However, the code calls the function `func_2` with an argument `-1`, which updates the state of the program to reflect that `func_2` has been called with this specific argument. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
