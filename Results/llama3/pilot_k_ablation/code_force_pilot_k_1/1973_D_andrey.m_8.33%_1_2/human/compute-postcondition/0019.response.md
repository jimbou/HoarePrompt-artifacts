Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `stdin` contains no input. Either `func_2` has been called with an argument `m` such that `func_1(p + 1, m)` returns `n` for some `p`, or `func_2` has not been called and `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than `n`.**
