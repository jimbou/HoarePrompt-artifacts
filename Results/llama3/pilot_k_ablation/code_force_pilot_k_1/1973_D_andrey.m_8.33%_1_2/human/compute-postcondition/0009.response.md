The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is greater than or equal to k, i is n // k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, p is 0, stdin contains no input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and j is now 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n` // `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is 1**
