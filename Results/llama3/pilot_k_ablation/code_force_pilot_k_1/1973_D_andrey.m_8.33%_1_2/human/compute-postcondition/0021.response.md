Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and performs the following actions:**

*   It finds the largest integer `max_val` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n` for `i` ranging from `n` to 1.
*   If `max_val` is not 0, it iterates from `n // k` to 1 and checks if `func_1(p + 1, m)` returns `n` for some `p`, where `m` is the product of the current iteration `i` and `max_val`. If such an `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)` and returns.
*   If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`.

**The function ultimately calls `func_2` with either a valid `m` value or -1, depending on the outcome of the iterations.**
