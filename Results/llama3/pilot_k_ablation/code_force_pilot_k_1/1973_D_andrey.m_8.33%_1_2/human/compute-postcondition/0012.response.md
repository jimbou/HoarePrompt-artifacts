Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4, `i` is `n` // `k`, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(1, m)`, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is 1, `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The relationship between the variables and their constraints are still valid, and the current value of `p` is still greater than or equal to `n`.
