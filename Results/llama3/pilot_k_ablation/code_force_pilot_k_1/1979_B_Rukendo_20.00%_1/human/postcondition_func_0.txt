This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two space-separated integers x and y. For each test case, it compares the binary representations of x and y from right to left and counts the number of matching bits. It then prints the result as a power of 2 to the console. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables x, y, and other temporary variables in a zero or empty state.
