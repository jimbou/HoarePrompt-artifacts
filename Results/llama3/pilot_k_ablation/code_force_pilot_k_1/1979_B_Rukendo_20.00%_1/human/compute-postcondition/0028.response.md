The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representation of `x` and `y`.

Since `cnt` is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representation of `x` and `y`, it represents the number of bits that are the same at the beginning of both binary numbers.

Therefore, the output will be 2 raised to the power of the number of common prefix bits between the binary representation of `x` and `y`.

Output: **2^cnt (where cnt is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representation of x and y)**
