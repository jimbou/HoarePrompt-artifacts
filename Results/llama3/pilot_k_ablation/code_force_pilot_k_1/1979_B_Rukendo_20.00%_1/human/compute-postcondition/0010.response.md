Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1.**

In this output state, the value of l2 has been updated by appending 0 to it, resulting in the same number of elements as l1. The other variables remain unchanged.
