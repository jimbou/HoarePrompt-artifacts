Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains 0 lines of input, _ is t-1, the current value of x is 0, the current value of y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the last value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the last value of y in reverse order. The length of l1 is either equal to the length of l2, or l1 has an additional element 0 appended to it if the original length of l2 was more than the length of l1. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, then n is the length of l2. Otherwise, n is the length of l1, cnt is the number of common prefix bits in the binary representation of the last x and y, and 2^cnt has been printed t times.**
