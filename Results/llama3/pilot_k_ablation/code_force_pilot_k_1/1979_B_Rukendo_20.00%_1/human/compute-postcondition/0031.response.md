Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of distinct non-negative integers from standard input, calculates the number of common prefix bits in their binary representations, and prints the result as a power of 2 for each pair. The function processes multiple pairs as specified by an initial integer input, and it handles pairs of varying bit lengths by padding the shorter binary representation with a leading zero if necessary.**
