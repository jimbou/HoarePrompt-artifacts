Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order. The length of l2 is now equal to the length of l1, either by l2 being originally equal to or longer than l1, or by l2 being made equal to the length of l1 by adding an additional element 0 to l1 if l1 was originally shorter than l2, n is the length of l1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is now equal to the length of `l1`, which is the binary representation of the original value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
