Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is an integer between 0 and 10^9, y is an integer between 0 and 10^9, l1 is a list containing one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been modified by the code. The first line appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to the list `l1`. Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the remainder of `x` divided by 2 can be either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of `x` by 2, effectively reducing the value of `x` by half. The other variables remain unchanged.
