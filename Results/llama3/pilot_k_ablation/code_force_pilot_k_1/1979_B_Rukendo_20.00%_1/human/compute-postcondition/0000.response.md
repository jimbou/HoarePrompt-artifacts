Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, `x` != `y`).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are between 0 and 10^9 and are not equal.
