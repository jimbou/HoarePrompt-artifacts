Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y)**.

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains the remaining t lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers x and y. The values of x and y are not affected by the code and remain as specified in the initial state.
