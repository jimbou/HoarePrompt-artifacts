Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order, and the length of l2 is more than or equal to the length of l1. Additionally, the current length of l1 is less than the current length of l2.**
