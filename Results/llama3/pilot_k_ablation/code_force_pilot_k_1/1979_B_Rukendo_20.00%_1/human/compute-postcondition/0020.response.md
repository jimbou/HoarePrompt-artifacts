Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order. The length of l2 is now equal to the length of l1, either by l2 being originally equal to or longer than l1, or by l2 being made equal to the length of l1 by adding an additional element 0 to l1 if l1 was originally shorter than l2, n is the length of l1 if l1 is longer than l2, otherwise n is the length of l2, cnt is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the program is updated with the new variable `cnt` having a value of 0.
