Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order, the length of l2 is more than or equal to the length of l1, the current length of l1 is less than or equal to the length of l2, and l1 has an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the contents of stdin are also unchanged. The values of `_`, `x`, and `y` are still 0. The lists `l1` and `l2` still contain the binary representations of the original values of `x` and `y`, respectively, in reverse order. However, `l1` now has an additional element 0 appended to it, which may have changed its length. The length of `l2` is still more than or equal to the length of `l1`, but the current length of `l1` is now less than or equal to the length of `l2`.
