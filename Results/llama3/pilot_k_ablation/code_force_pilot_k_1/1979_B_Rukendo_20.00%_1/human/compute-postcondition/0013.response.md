Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), `_` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order, the length of `l2` is more than or equal to the length of `l1`, and the current length of `l1` is less than the current length of `l2` and `l1` has an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `l1` now has an additional element 0 appended to it, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
