The first line assigns the values of `x` and `y` from the first line of stdin to `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers, `x` and `y` become those values. The second line creates two empty lists, `l1` and `l2`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list**
