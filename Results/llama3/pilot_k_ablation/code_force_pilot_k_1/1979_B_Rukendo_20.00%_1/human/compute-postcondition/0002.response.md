Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is an integer between 0 and 10^9, y is an integer between 0 and 10^9, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list**

The code reads two space-separated integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `x` and `y`, respectively. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The code then initializes two empty lists, `l1` and `l2`, which do not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, or `_`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
