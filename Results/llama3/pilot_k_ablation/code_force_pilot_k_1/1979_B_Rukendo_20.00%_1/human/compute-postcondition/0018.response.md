Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order. The current value of l2 is shorter than the current value of l1, n is the length of l2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of `l2`, which is shorter than the length of `l1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
