Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, the current value of x is 0, the current value of y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y in reverse order. The length of l1 is either equal to the length of l2, or l1 has an additional element 0 appended to it if the original length of l2 was more than the length of l1, n is the length of l2 which is less than the length of l1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of n has been updated to be the length of l2, which is less than the length of l1. The other variables remain unchanged.
