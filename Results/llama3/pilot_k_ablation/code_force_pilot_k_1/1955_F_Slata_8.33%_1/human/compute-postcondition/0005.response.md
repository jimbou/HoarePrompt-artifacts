Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the integer division of the four numbers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of the first three numbers divided by 2 is equal to 3. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty.**
