The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`.

Here's a breakdown of the values:

*   `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` are the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, respectively. Since `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers between 0 and 200, these expressions will evaluate to integers between 0 and 100.
*   `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 3` are the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 and 3, respectively. These expressions will evaluate to either 0 or 1 for `a % 2` and `b % 2`, and either 0, 1, or 2 for `c % 3`.
*   The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` will evaluate to `True` if the sum of the remainders is equal to 3, and `False` otherwise. When converted to an integer using `int()`, `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0.

Output: **The sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, and c when divided by 2 and 3 is equal to 3, and 0 otherwise.**
