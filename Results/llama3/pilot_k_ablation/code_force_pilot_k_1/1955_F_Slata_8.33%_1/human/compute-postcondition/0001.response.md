Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= a, b, c, d <= 200), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `input()` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values of the four integers from the input, which are between 0 and 200 (inclusive). The value of `i` remains 0. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with four integers, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The condition that `input()` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
