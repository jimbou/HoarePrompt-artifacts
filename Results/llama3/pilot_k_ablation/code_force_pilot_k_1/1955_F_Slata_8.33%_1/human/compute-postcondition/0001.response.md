Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= a, b, c, d <= 200), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and an integer t-1 (1 <= t-1 <= 10^4) at the beginning.**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been assigned the values of the four integers from the input, which are between 0 and 200 (inclusive). The value of `i` remains 0, as it was not modified by the code. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with four integers, and the integer t-1 at the beginning, as one line of input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
