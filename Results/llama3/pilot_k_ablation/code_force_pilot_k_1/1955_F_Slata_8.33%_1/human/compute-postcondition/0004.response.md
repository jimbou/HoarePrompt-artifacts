Output State: **`i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, stdin is empty, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the last four integers in the input (0 <= a, b, c, d <= 200), and the loop has printed the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 3, which is equal to 3, for each of the `t` lines in the input.**
