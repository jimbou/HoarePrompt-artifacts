Output: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers (0 <= a, b, c, d <= 200), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and an integer t-1 (1 <= t-1 <= 10^4) at the beginning, and this is printed: the sum of the integer division of a, b, c, d by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainder of a, b, c divided by 2 is equal to 3**
