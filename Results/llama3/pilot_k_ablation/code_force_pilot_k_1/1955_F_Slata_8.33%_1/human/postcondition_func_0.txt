This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of these four integers by 2, plus the integer value of the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 3, which is equal to 3, for each line. The function processes a number of lines specified by the first integer read from standard input.
