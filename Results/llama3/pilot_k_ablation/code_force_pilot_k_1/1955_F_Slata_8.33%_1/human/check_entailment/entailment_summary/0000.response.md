Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The given program calculates this by summing the integer divisions of the four input integers by 2, and then adding the integer value of the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 3, which is equal to 3.

The logic behind this calculation is as follows:

*   The integer division of each number by 2 gives the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from that number. Since XOR of two identical numbers is 0, these pairs do not contribute to the final XOR result.
*   The remainder of each number divided by 2 represents the number of unpaired elements. If the sum of these remainders is 3, it means that there are three unpaired elements, which can be removed by Eve to make the final XOR result 0, resulting in a win for Bob.

The program correctly implements this logic and calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
