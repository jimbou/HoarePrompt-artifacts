To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters. The string contains only '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first character of the string is '.'.

So, for the loop to be executed, `stdin` must contain at least one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), and `_` is 0 (the first iteration).

State: **`stdin` contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases, `_` is 0**
