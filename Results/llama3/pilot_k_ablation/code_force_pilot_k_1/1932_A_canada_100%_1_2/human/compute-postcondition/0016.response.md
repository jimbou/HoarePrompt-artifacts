The code prints the number of '@' characters in the string `s` before the first occurrence of a specific character (not specified in the precondition). Since the exact string `s` and the specific character are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters before the first occurrence of the specific character in the string `s`.

Output: **the number of '@' characters in the string s before the first occurrence of a specific character**
