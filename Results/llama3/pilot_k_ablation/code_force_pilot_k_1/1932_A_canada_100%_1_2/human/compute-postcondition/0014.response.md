Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `ret` is 1 if the first character `i` in `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.***
