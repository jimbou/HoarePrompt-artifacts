Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. The function then iterates through each string, counting the number of '@' characters (representing coins) until it encounters two '*' characters (representing thorns) in a row. The function prints the total count of '@' characters for each test case, effectively ignoring any characters after the first occurrence of two consecutive '*' characters. The function repeats this process for all test cases, leaving the standard input empty upon completion.**
