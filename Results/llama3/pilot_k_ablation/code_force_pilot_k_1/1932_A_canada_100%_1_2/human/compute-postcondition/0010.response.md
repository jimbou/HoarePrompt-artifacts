Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, and the first character in `s`, `i`, is equal to '*' and not equal to '@'. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
