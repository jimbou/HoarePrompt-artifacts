Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of a_i is divisible by n. n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers. If all elements in arr are sorted in ascending order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr such that the first element is greater than the second element, 'NO' is printed.***
