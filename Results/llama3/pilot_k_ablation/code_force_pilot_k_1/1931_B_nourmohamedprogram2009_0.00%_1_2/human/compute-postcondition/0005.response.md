Output: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of a_i is divisible by n. n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of n integers. The current value of arr is sorted in ascending order, meaning each element in arr is less than or equal to the next element, and 'YES' is being printed**
