Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of a_i is divisible by n. n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of n integers.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `t` is at least 1, there are `t - 1` test cases left in stdin. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to `arr`. The third line sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` remains 0. The state of `n` and `arr` is updated as described above.
