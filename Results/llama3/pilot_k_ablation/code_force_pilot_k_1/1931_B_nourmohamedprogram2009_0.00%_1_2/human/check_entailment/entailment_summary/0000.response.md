Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program only checks if the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is not sufficient to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in the containers and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal to the average by pouring water from one container to another. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking if the cumulative sum of the amounts of water in the containers is always greater than or equal to the average multiplied by the current index.

Correctness: **False**
