Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program sorts the array and then checks if the array is non-decreasing. However, this approach is not correct because the problem statement allows pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j. This means that the array does not need to be non-decreasing to be able to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in the containers and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the containers with more water to the containers with less water.

Correctness: **False**
