Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the array and then checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one. However, this approach does not take into account the actual constraint of the problem, which is that the sum of the elements is divisible by the number of containers.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will sort the array to [1, 2, 3] and then print 'YES', but the correct answer is 'NO' because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water per container and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
