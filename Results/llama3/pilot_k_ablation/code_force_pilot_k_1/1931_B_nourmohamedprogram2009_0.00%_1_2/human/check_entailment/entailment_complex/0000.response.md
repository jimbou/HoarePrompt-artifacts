Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, which involves pouring water from one container to another. However, the program simply checks if the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not take into account the actual operation of pouring water from one container to another. It only checks if the array is sorted, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the containers can be made equal.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The program will output 'NO' because the array is not sorted. However, it is possible to make the containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, as shown in the problem's note.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
