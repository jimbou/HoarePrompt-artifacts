This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then processes each list to identify pairs of consecutive integers where the second integer is greater than the first, and counts the total number of such pairs across all test cases. The function returns the total count of such pairs, leaving the input stream empty and all variables in a reset state.
