Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input array has a length of 1. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the penalty. The program assumes that the array will always have at least two elements, but this is not guaranteed by the problem description.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will not correctly calculate the penalty, because it will not enter the loop that calculates the penalty. The correct output for this input should be 0, but the program will not output anything.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
