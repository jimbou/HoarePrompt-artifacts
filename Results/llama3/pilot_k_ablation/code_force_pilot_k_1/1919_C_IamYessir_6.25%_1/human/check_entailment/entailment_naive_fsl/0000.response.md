Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program splits the array into two subsequences. The program always appends the current element to the first subsequence if it is greater than the last element of the first subsequence, and otherwise appends it to the second subsequence. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty.

A counterexample is the input [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will split this array into ([3, 4, 1], [1, 5]), resulting in a penalty of 2. However, the optimal split is ([3, 4, 5], [1, 1]), which results in a penalty of 1.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
