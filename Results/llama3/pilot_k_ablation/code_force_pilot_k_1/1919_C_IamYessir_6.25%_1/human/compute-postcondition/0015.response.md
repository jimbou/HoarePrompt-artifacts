To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b)`. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers from `lit` that are less than the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**
