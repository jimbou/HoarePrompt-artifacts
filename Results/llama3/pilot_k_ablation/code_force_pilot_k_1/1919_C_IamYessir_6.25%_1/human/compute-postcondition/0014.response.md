Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `b` is a list containing the integers from `lit` that are less than the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is 0. If `n` is 1 or less, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and `b` is an empty list, and `s` is 0.**
