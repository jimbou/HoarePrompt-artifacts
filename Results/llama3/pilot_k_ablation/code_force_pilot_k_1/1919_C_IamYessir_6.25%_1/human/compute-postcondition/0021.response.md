The code prints the value of `s`, which is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `a` where the second integer is greater than the first plus the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `b` where the second integer is greater than the first.
Output: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is greater than or equal to the previous one, `b` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is less than the last integer in `a`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `a` where the second integer is greater than the first plus the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `b` where the second integer is greater than the first, and the value of `s` is being printed**
