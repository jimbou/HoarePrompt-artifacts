Output: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `b` is a list containing the integers from `lit` that are less than the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is 0. If `b` has only one element, `s` is 0, and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, which is `s`, is being printed**
