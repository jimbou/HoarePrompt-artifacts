Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each integer is greater than or equal to the previous one, `b` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is less than the last integer in `a`, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**
