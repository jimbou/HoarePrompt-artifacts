To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`. Since each test case contains two inputs (the size of the array and the list of integers), we need to ensure that there is at least one test case in the input.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, _ is 0**

Note that we don't need to specify the exact value of the input, just that there is at least one test case available to read. The variable `_` is initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the loop counter.
