Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is 0. If the first integer of `lit` is less than the second integer of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and `b` is a list containing the second integer from `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements from `lit` and `b` is an empty list.***
