Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `cp` is 0. If the last element of `a` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.***
