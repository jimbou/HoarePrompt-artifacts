Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `cp` is 0. If `n` is 1, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. If `n` is greater than 1, then `a` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is greater than or equal to the previous one, and `b` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is less than the last integer in `a`.**
