Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0. The last element of `a` is less than the first element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` in `lit`, which is the second element of `lit` since `i` is 1. The last element of `a` is still less than the first element of `b`, as the relationship between the elements of `a` and `lit` has not changed. The values of the other variables remain the same.
