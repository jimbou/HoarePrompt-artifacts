Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers from `lit` that are less than the first integer of `lit` in the order they appear, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus one, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that there is one more pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first. All other variables remain unchanged.
