Output State: **`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, If `n` is 1, then `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. If `n` is greater than 1, then `a` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is greater than or equal to the previous one, and `b` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is less than the last integer in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
