Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the size of the array) followed by a list of integers (the elements of the array). It then processes each test case by splitting the array into two lists (a and b) based on the condition that elements in list a are in increasing order and elements in list b are also in increasing order. The function counts the number of pairs of adjacent elements in both lists that are in increasing order and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and does not return any value.**
