Output State: **n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer read from the first input in stdin. The list `lit` contains a list of integers read from the second input in stdin. The list `a` contains only the first integer from `lit`, while the list `b` remains empty. The variable `cp` is initialized to 0. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus the two inputs that were read. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
