Output State: **n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

The code block reads two inputs from stdin: an integer `n` and a list of integers `lit`. It then initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` contains the first integer from `lit` and `b` is empty. The variable `cp` is set to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the execution of the code block, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two inputs that were read.
