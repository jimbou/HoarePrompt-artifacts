Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is greater than or equal to the previous one, `b` is a list of integers from `lit` where each integer is less than the last integer in `a` and `b` has at least 2 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `a` where the second integer is greater than the first, `i` is 1. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`***
