The value of `a` is updated by appending the value of `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `lit[i]` is the second element of `lit`. The last element of `a` is larger than or equal to the second element of `lit`, so the last element of `a` is larger than or equal to the value appended to `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first two elements from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `_` is 0. The last element of `a` is larger than or equal to the second element of `lit`**
