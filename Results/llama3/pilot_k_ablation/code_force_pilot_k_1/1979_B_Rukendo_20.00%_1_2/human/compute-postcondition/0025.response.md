Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, n is equal to the length of l1 and must be greater than 0, cnt is 0, i is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside, but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
