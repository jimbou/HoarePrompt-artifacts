Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, n is equal to the length of l1 and must be greater than 0, cnt is 0, i is 0, and l1[i] is not equal to l2[i]***
