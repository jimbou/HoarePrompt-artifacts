To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), `_` is 0**
