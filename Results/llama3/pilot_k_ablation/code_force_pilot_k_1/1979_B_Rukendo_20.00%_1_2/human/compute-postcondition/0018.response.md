Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, n is equal to the length of l2 which is less than the length of l1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n is updated to be equal to the length of l2, which is less than the length of l1. The other variables remain unchanged. The input in stdin is still present, and the lists l1 and l2 still contain the binary representations of the initial values of x and y, respectively.
