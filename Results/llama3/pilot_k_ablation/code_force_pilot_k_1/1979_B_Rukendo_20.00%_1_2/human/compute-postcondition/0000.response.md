The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a single integer `t`, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, but the first line has been consumed. Each of the remaining lines contains two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y)**
