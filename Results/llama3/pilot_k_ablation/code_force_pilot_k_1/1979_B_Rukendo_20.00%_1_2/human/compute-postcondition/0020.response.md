Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, n is equal to the length of l1. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, then the length of l2 is now equal to the length of l1, otherwise, the length of l1 is now equal to the length of l2, cnt is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `cnt` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
