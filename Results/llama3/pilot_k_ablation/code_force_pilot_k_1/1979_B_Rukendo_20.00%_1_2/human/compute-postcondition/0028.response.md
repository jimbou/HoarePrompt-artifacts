The code prints the result of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representations of `x` and `y`. Since `cnt` is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representations of `x` and `y`, the value of `cnt` depends on the values of `x` and `y`. However, based on the precondition, we know that `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `x` is not equal to `y`. Therefore, the value of `cnt` will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent the maximum value of `x` and `y`, which is 10^9.

Output: **2^[cnt] (where cnt is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representations of x and y)**
