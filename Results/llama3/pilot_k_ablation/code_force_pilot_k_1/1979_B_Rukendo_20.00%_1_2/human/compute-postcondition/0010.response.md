Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, the length of l2 is less than or equal to the length of l1, and l2 has an additional element 0 at the end.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list l2 now has an additional element 0 at the end, which may or may not affect the length comparison with l1.
