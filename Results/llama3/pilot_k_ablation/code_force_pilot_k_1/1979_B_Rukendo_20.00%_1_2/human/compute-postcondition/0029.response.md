The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representations of `x` and `y`. Since `cnt` is not explicitly given, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 ** cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, n is equal to the length of l1, cnt is the number of common prefix bits between the binary representations of x and y, and 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed**
