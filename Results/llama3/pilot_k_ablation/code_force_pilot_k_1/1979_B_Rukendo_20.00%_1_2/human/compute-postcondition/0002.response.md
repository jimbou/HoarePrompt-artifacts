Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), y is an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), x != y, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list**

The code reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from the first line of stdin and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are not equal. The remaining `t-1` lines of stdin are left untouched. The variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized as empty lists. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
