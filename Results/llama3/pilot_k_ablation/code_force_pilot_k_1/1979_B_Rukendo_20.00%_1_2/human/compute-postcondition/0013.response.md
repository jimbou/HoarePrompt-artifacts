Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y), _ is 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the initial value of y in reverse order, the length of l2 is more than or equal to the length of l1, and the length of l1 is now equal to the length of l2.**

In this output state, the value of `l1` has been updated by appending 0 to it, making its length equal to the length of `l2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
