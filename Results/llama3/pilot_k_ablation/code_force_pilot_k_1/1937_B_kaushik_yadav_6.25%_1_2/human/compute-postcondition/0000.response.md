The code reads the number of test cases from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The `input()` function is replaced with `sys.stdin.readline` to read input from stdin. This change does not affect the value of `t`.

Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length as the integer.**
