The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the end of string `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first character of string `a` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**
