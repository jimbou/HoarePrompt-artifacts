Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`. `i` is either 1 or an index such that `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. Either `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a` or `i` is greater than the length of `a`.***
