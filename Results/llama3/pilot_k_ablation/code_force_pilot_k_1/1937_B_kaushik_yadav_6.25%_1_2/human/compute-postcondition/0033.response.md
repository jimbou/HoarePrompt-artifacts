Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then processes each test case by concatenating the strings in a specific order based on certain conditions, prints the resulting string, and finally prints a counter value calculated from the original strings. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
