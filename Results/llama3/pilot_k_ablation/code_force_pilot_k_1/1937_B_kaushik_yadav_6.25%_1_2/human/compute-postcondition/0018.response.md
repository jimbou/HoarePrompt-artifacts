Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order depending on the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is lexicographically smaller than `b`, `ans` contains all characters of `a` followed by all characters of `b`. If `a` is lexicographically larger than `b`, `ans` contains the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating manner until the end of `a` or `b` is reached, then the remaining characters of the other string are appended. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**
