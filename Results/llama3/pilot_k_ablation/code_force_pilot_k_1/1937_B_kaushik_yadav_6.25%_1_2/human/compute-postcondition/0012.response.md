Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `work` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. Either `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a` or `i` is greater than the length of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` is still valid, but now `i` could also be equal to the length of `a` or greater than the length of `a`.
