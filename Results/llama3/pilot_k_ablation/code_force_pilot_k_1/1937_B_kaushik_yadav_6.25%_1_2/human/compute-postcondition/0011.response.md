Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. Either `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
