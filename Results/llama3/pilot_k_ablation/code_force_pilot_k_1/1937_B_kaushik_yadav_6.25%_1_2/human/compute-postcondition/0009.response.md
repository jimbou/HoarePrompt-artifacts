Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is an index such that `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. Either previously `i + 1` was not less than the length of `a`, or `b[i]` was not less than `a[i + 1]`, but now `i + 1` equals the length of `a`.**
