Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length greater than 0, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the character at index `i` in string `b` is less than the character at index `i+1` in string `a`.**

The value of `work` is changed to False. The values of the other variables are not affected. The conditions that `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the character at index `i` in string `b` is less than the character at index `i+1` in string `a` are still valid.
