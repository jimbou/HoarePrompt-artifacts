Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order depending on the values of `a` and `b`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `j` is 0, and the current value of `a[j + 1]` is '0' and the current value of `b[j]` is '1'.**
