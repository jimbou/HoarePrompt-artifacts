Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not the one that can be attained by choosing any available path. 

For example, consider the input:

    3
    
    2
    
    01
    
    10
    
In this case, the lexicographically smallest string is "01", but the program will output "10" because it always chooses the path that goes right first. 

The program should be modified to correctly handle this case. One possible solution is to use dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be attained by choosing any available path. 

Here is a possible corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(2)]
        dp[0][0] = a[0]
        dp[1][0] = b[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                dp[0][i] = a[i]
                dp[1][i] = b[i]
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                dp[0][i] = b[i]
                dp[1][i] = a[i]
            else:
                dp[0][i] = a[i]
                dp[1][i] = b[i]
        ans = ''
        i = 0
        work = True
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += dp[0][i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and dp[1][i] < dp[0][i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += dp[1][i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += dp[1][i]
                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if dp[0][j + 1] == dp[1][j]:
                counter += 1
            if dp[0][j + 1] == '0' and dp[1][j] == '1':
                counter = 1
        print(counter)

func()
```

This corrected version of the program uses dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be attained by choosing any available path. It then uses this string to find the number of paths that yield this string.
