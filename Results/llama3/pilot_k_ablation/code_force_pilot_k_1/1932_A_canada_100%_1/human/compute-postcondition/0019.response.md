Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of '@' characters in each string before the first occurrence of '**' or the end of the string, whichever comes first. It iterates through each character in the string, incrementing the count for each '@' character and resetting the count when a '*' character is encountered. The function continues this process until it has processed all test cases, at which point stdin is empty.**
