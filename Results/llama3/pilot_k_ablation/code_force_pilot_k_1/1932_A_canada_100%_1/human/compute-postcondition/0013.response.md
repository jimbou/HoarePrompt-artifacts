Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 0, _ is 0, i is the first character in the list, and i is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is set to 0.***
