The code prints the number of '@' characters in the list `s` before the first occurrence of ' ', which is stored in the variable `ret`. Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters before the first ' ' in the list `s`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters in the list s before the first occurrence of ' ' )**
