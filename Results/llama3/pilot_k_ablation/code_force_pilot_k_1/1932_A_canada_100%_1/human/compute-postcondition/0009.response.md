Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is '*', `i` is not equal to '@', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
