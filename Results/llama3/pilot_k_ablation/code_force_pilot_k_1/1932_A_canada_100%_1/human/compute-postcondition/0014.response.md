Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, _ is 0. If i is '@', then ret is 1 and thorn is 0. If i is '*', then if thorn is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if i is '*', no change occurs. If i is not '*' and not '@', then thorn is set to 0.***
