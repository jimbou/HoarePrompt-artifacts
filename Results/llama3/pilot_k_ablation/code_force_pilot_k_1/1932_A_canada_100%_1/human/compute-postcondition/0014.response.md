Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0 or 1, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `input()` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1. If the first character in the list `s` is not '@', then `ret` is 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables. If the first character in the list `s` is not '*' and not '@', then the program continues with the current state of variables.***
