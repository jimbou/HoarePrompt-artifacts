Output State: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 1, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, input() is greater than 0, _ is 0, and the first character in the list s is '@'.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `thorn` to 0, and the second line increments the value of `ret` by 1. 

Since `ret` was initially 0, it becomes 1 after the second line executes. The value of `thorn` is set to 0 in the first line, so it remains 0. 

All other variables (`len`, `s`, `stdin`, `input()`, `_`) are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values. The length `len` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is still a list of characters with at least one character and the first character '@', `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases, `input()` is still greater than 0, and `_` is still 0.
