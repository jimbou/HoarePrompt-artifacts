Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `input()` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the current value of `i` is '*', which is the first character in the list and not equal to '@'. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables.***
