Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it handles the thorns. According to the problem description, you can move one or two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain thorns. However, the program breaks the loop as soon as it encounters two thorns in a row, which is not the correct condition to stop collecting coins.

A counterexample is the input ".@@*@.**@@". The program will break the loop when it encounters the two thorns in a row, but it should continue to collect coins after the thorns. The correct output for this input is 3, but the program will output a lower number because it stops collecting coins too early.

The program should be modified to correctly handle the thorns and continue collecting coins after encountering them, as long as the destination cell does not contain thorns.
