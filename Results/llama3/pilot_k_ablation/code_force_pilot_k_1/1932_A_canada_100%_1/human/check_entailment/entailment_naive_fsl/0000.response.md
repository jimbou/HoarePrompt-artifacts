Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when there are two or more consecutive thorns. According to the problem description, if you move to a cell with thorns, it is an illegal move. However, the program only checks if there are two thorns in a row and breaks the loop if it finds two consecutive thorns. It does not consider the case where there are more than two consecutive thorns.

For example, if the input is ".@@***@", the program will only count the coins before the first two thorns and will not consider the coins after the third thorn. The correct output should be 3, but the program will output 2.

The program should be modified to handle the case where there are more than two consecutive thorns. One possible solution is to use a flag to indicate whether the current cell is reachable or not. If the current cell is a thorn, set the flag to False. If the current cell is a coin or an empty cell, set the flag to True. Only count the coins if the flag is True.
