The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then processes each string, counting the number of '@' characters (representing coins) that appear before the first occurrence of two '*' characters (representing thorns) in a row. The function prints the total count of '@' characters across all test cases, effectively ignoring any characters that appear after the first occurrence of two '*' characters in a row.
