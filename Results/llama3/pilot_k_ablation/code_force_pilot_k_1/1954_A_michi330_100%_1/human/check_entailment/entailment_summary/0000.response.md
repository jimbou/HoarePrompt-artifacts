Reasoning: 

The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. 

The condition `n <= k` checks if the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is true, then Bob can always make all parts have the same color by repainting all of them.

The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if the difference between the number of parts and the ceiling of the number of parts divided by the number of colors is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is true, then Bob can always make all parts have the same color by repainting the parts that are not the most frequent color.

If neither of these conditions is true, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
