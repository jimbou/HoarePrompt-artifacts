Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program uses the condition `n > k and n - math.ceil(n / m) > k` to determine this.

The condition `n > k` checks if the number of parts is greater than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is true, it means that Bob cannot repaint all parts to have the same color.

The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k` checks if the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color is greater than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is true, it means that Bob cannot repaint all parts to have the same color, even if he repaints all the parts that are not painted with the most frequent color.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output based on the conditions.

Correctness: **True**
