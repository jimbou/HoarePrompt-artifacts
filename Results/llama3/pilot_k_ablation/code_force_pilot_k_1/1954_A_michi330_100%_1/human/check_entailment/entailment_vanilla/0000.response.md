Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of parts `n`, the number of colors `m`, and the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`.
3. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that even if Alice paints the ribbon with the maximum number of different colors, Bob can still repaint the remaining parts to make all parts the same color. In this case, the program also prints 'NO'.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color, so the program prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
