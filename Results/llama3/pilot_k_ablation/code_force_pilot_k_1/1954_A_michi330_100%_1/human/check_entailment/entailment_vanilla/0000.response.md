Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The given program attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of parts `n`, the number of colors `m`, and the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`.

3. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means Bob can repaint all parts, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, it means Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts have the same color, so the program prints 'NO'.

4. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

However, the program's logic is incorrect. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` does not accurately represent the scenario where Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts have the same color.

A correct approach would be to check if `m` is greater than 1 (since Alice can choose at least two colors) and if `k` is less than `n` (since Bob cannot repaint all parts). Additionally, the program should check if `k` is less than the minimum number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts have the same color.

Correctness: **False**
