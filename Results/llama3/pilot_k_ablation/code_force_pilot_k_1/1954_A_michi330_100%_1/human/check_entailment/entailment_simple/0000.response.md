Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. Then, for each test case, it reads the number of parts `n`, the number of colors `m`, and the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`.

The program then checks two conditions:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

2. If the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program also prints 'NO'.

If neither of these conditions is true, it means that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
