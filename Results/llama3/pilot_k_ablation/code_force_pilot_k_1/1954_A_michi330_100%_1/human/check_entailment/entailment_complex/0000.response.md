Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program uses the condition `n > k and n - math.ceil(n / m) > k` to determine this.

The reasoning behind this condition is as follows:

- `n > k` checks if the number of parts is greater than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is not met, Bob can simply repaint all parts to make them the same color.

- `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k` checks if the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color is greater than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is not met, Bob can repaint the parts that are not painted with the most frequent color to make all parts the same color.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints 'Yes' if the condition is true and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
