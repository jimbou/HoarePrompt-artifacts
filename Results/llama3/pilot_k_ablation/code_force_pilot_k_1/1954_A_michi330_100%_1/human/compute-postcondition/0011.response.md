Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers n, m, and k. It then determines whether a certain condition is met (n > k and n - math.ceil(n / m) > k) and prints 'Yes' if the condition is true and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes multiple test cases and prints a result for each case.**
