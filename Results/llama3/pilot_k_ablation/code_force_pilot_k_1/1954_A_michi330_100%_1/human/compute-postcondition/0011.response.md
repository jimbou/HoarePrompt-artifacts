Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k. It then determines whether a certain condition is met for each test case. If n is less than or equal to k, or if the difference between n and the ceiling of n divided by m is less than or equal to k, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.**
