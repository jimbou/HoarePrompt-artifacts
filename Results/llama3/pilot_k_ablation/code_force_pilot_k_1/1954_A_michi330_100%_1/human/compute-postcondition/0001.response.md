To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to specify the initial value of `itest` to make the loop execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50), `itest` is 0**
