According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `itest` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50), `t` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**
