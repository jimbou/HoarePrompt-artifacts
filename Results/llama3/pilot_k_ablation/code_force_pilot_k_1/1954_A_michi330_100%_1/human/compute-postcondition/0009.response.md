Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is larger than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is larger than `k`, then 'Yes' is printed.***
