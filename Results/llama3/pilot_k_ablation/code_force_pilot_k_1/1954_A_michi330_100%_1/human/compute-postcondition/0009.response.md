Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `itest` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
