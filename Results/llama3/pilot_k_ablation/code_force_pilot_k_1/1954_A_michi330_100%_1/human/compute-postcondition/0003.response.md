Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). The current values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are such that either `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`.**
