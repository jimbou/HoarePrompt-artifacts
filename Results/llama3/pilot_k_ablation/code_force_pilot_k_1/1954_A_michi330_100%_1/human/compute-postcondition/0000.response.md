Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k, where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50. The values of n, m, and k are not yet assigned to any variables, but they are still present in the input.
