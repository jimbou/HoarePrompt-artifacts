Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). Additionally, n is larger than k and n - math.ceil(n / m) is larger than k, and 'Yes' is being printed**
