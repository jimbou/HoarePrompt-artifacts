Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `itest` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the values read from the first line of the input. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `itest` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, as one line has been read and processed.
