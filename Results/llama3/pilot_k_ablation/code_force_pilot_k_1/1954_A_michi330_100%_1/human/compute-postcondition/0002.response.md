Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the three integers from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).
