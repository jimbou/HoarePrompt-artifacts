Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks if `n` equals `k` and prints a string of '1' repeated `n` times if they are equal, or -1 if they are not. This does not guarantee that the output array will have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the program will print -1, but a valid solution exists: `[69420, 69, 420]`. Similarly, if `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program will print -1, but there is no valid solution.

The program does not attempt to construct an array that meets the problem's requirements, and its output does not necessarily correspond to a valid solution.

Correctness: **False**
