Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that satisfies two conditions: (1) 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and (2) out of the n total cyclic shifts of a, exactly k of them are sorted. However, the program only checks if n is equal to k and prints a string of '1 ' repeated n times if they are equal, or -1 if they are not. This does not guarantee that the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n satisfies the two conditions.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints -1, but a valid array a = [69420, 69, 420] exists, which satisfies the two conditions.

Correctness: **False**
