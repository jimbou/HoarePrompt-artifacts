Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` and prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times if they are equal, or -1 if they are not. This does not guarantee that the output array will have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

For example, if `n` is 3 and `k` is 1, the program will print -1, but a valid solution is [69420, 69, 420] as shown in the example output. Similarly, if `n` is 3 and `k` is 2, the program will print -1, but there is no valid solution.

The program does not correctly solve the problem and does not consider all possible cases.

Correctness: **False**
