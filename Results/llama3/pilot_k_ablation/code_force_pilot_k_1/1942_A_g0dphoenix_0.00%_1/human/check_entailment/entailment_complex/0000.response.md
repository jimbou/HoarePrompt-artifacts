Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` and prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times if they are equal, or -1 if they are not.

The program does not attempt to construct an array `a` that satisfies the problem's requirements. It does not consider the case where `k` is less than `n`, which is a valid input according to the problem statement. In such cases, the program should try to construct an array `a` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

For example, when `n` is 3 and `k` is 1, the program should output an array like `[69420, 69, 420]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift. However, the program simply outputs -1 in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
