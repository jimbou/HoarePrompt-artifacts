Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n > k > 1. In this case, the program should output an array that has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts, but the program simply outputs -1. 

For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program should output an array like [1, 2, 1] which has 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 1]. But the program outputs -1.

The program only works correctly when n = k, in which case it outputs an array of all 1s, which indeed has n sorted cyclic shifts. But it does not handle the case when n > k > 1 correctly.
