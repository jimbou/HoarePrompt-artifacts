Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program should output a valid array a that satisfies the conditions, but instead, it outputs -1. However, a valid array a = [69420, 69, 420] does exist, which satisfies the conditions.

The program only handles the case when n == k, but it does not handle other cases correctly. It simply outputs -1 for all other cases, which is incorrect. The program should be able to find a valid array a for all cases that satisfy the conditions.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle all cases correctly. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated algorithm to find a valid array a that satisfies the conditions.
