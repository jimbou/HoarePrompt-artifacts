Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers, n and k, representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, respectively.

3. The program then checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of 1's of length n, which satisfies the condition because all cyclic shifts of an array of 1's are sorted.

4. If n is not equal to k, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

However, this program is incomplete and incorrect. It does not handle the case where k is less than n and k is not equal to 1. In such cases, the program should print an array that has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

For example, if n = 3 and k = 1, the program should print an array like [1, 2, 3] or [3, 1, 2], which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases.

Correctness: **False**
