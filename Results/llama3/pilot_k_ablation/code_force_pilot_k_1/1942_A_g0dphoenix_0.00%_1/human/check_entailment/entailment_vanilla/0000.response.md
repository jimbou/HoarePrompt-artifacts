Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of n and k.

If n is equal to k, the program prints a string of '1's repeated n times, which represents an array of 1's of length n. This is a correct solution because an array of all 1's has all its cyclic shifts sorted.

However, if n is not equal to k, the program simply prints -1, indicating that there is no solution. This is incorrect because there are cases where n is not equal to k and a solution still exists.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, a possible solution is the array [69, 420, 69420] as shown in the problem statement. But the program will print -1 for this case, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
