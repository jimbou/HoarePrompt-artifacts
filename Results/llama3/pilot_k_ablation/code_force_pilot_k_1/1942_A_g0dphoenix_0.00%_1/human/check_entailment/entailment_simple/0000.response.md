Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` and if so, prints a string of `1`s repeated `n` times. However, this solution is not correct for all cases.

For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the program prints `-1`, but a valid solution is `[69420, 69, 420]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

The program also does not consider the case where `k` is less than `n` but not equal to 1. In such cases, it is possible to construct an array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
