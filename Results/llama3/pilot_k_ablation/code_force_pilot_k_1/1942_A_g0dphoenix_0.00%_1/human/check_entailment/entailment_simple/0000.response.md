Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` and prints a string of `1`s repeated `n` times if they are equal, or `-1` otherwise.

The program does not attempt to construct an array `a` that satisfies the problem's requirements. In fact, the program's output does not even depend on the value of `k` when `n` is not equal to `k`.

Furthermore, the program's logic is flawed. When `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints a string of `1`s repeated `n` times, which is not necessarily a valid solution. For example, when `n` is 3 and `k` is 3, the program prints `1 1 1`, but this array has only one sorted cyclic shift, not three.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
