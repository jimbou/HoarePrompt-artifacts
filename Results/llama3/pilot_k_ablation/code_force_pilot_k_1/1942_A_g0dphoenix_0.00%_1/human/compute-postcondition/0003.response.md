To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.
- stdin contains no input.

Given Code:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

Explanation:
- The expression `'1 ' * n` repeats the string `'1 '` `n` times. Since `n` is equal to `k`, this is equivalent to repeating `'1 '` `k` times.
- The `[:-1]` part slices the resulting string, removing the last character. Since each repetition of `'1 '` adds a space after the '1', this effectively removes the trailing space from the repeated string.

Given that `n` equals `k`, and assuming `n` (or `k`) has a specific integer value, let's denote this value as `[n]` (which is the same as `[k]`).

Output: **A string consisting of [n] '1's separated by spaces, without a trailing space.**

For example, if `n` (or `k`) is 3, the output would be:
```
1 1 1
```
If `n` (or `k`) is 5, the output would be:
```
1 1 1 1 1
```
And so on, depending on the actual value of `n` (or `k`).
