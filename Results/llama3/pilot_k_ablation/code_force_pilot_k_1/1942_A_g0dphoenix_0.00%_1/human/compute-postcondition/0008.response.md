Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains at least one integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`. If `n` is equal to `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (where n is equal to k) is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.***
