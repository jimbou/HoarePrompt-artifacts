Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin initially contains an integer `t` that must be greater than 0, but after the execution of the code, the stdin is empty because it has been used to assign values to `n` and `k`.
