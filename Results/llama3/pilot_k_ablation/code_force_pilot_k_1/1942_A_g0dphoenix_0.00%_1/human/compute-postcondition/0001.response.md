Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one less pair of integers. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
