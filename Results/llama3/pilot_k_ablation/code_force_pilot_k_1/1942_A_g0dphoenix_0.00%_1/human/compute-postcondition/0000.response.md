To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), `_` is 0**
