This function reads a series of input pairs (n, k) from stdin, where each pair is on a new line, and prints either a string of '1 ' repeated n times (with the last space removed) if n equals k, or -1 if n does not equal k, for each input pair. The function continues this process until all input pairs have been processed, resulting in an empty stdin and an output containing the corresponding results for each pair.
