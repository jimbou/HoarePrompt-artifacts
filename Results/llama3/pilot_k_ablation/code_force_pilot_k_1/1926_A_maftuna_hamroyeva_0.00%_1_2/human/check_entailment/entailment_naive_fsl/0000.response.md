Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the variables `l` and `h` are not reset to 0 after each test case. This means that the counts from previous test cases are carried over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:

```
2
AAAAA
BBBBB
```

The program will output:

```
A
A
```

Instead of the correct output:

```
A
B
```

This is because the count of 'A's from the first test case is not reset to 0 before the second test case, so the count of 'A's in the second test case is incorrect.
