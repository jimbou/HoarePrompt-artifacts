Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 31, `l` is 1, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string and is 'A', stdin contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, since one string has been read and processed.
