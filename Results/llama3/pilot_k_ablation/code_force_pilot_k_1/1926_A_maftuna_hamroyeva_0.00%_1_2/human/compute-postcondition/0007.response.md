Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 31, `l` is 0, `h` is 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string and is not 'A', stdin contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin now contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, since one string has been processed.
