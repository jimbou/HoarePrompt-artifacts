To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 32, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**
