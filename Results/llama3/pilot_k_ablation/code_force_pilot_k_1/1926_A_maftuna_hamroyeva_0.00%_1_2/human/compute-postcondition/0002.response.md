Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 31, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still between 1 and 32, but since one string has been read from the input, the remaining number of strings in the input is `t-1`. The values of `l`, `h`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first string from the input, which is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The stdin now contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
