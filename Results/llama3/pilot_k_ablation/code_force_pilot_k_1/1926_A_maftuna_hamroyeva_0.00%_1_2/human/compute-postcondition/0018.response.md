Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 31, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, `h` is the number of 'B's in `a`, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` > `h`, then 'A' is being printed. If `l` < `h`, then 'B' is being printed. If `l` is not greater than `h`, no action is taken.***
