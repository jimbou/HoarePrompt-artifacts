Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0 or 1, d is an integer, b is a string that must have at least 1 character, j is 0. If the first character of b is '@', then s is 1. If the first character of b is '*', then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if j is equal to the last index of b, or if the current value of b at index j+1 is '*'.***
