Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty ('.'). a is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, s is 0.**

The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable 'a'. Since stdin initially contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases, after this line executes, stdin will contain t-1 test cases. The second line initializes the variable 's' to 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
