The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases and a is equal to the value of the first test case, so for the loop to execute, a must be at least 1 and i is now 0.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0**
