To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `j` and the string `b`. 

For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least 1 character. 

State: **stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string that must have at least 1 character, j is 0**
