Output State: **stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string that must have at least 1 character, j is equal to the last index of b, and the first character of b is not '@'. The current value of b at index j is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables a, i, s, d, b, and j remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The string b still has at least 1 character, and its first character is not '@'. The current value of b at index j is still '*'.
