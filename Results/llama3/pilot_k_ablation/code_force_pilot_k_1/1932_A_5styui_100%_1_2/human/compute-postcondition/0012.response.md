Output State: **stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string that must have at least 1 character, j is 0, the first character of b is not '@', the current value of b at index j is '*', and j is not equal to len(b) - 1. The current value of b at index j+1 is '*' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables a, i, s, d, b, and j remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The string b still has at least 1 character, and its first character is not '@'. The current value of b at index j is still '*', and j is still not equal to len(b) - 1. The current value of b at index j+1 is still '*'. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
