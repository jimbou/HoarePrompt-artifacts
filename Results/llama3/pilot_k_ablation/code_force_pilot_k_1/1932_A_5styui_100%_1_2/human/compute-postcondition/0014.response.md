Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string that must have at least 1 character, the first character of b is not '@', and the current value of b at index j is '*'. If j is equal to the last index of b, or if the current value of b at index j+1 is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
