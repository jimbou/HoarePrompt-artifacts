The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters (representing coins) in each string, ignoring any '*' characters (representing thorns) that are not immediately followed by another '*'. The function prints the count of coins for each test case and resets the count after each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
