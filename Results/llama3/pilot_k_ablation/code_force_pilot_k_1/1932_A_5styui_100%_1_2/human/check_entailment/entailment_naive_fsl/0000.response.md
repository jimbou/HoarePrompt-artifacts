Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding thorns. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the current cell is a coin or a thorn, but it does not consider the possibility of moving two cells at a time to avoid thorns.

For example, consider the input:

5
.@*@

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 2, because we can move two cells at a time to collect the coin at the third cell, avoiding the thorn at the second cell.

The program needs to be modified to consider the possibility of moving two cells at a time and to keep track of the maximum number of coins that can be collected.
