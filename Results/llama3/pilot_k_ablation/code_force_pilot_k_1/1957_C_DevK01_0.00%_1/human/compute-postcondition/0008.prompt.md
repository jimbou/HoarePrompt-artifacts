You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1
    #State: len is a non-negative integer, and the value of len is more than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the element in the collection 'dp' that is equal to the current value of 'len', where 'len' is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is also an element in the collection 'dp'.
    #State: len is a non-negative integer, the value of len is more than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2. x1 is the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 1, and x2 is 2 times the product of len - 1 and the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number 1

Case_2: The program returns the element in the collection 'dp' that is equal to the current value of 'len', where 'len' is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is also an element in the collection 'dp'.

Case_3: The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2. x1 is the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 1, and x2 is 2 times the product of len - 1 and the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
