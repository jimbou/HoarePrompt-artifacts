Output State: **len is a non-negative integer, len is larger than 0, and len is not in dp, dp[len] is the sum of helper(len - 1) and 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)**

The code executes as follows:

*   The first line assigns the value of `helper(len - 1)` to `x1`. Since `len` is a non-negative integer larger than 0, `len - 1` is a non-negative integer.
*   The second line assigns the value of `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` to `x2`. Since `len` is a non-negative integer larger than 0, `len - 2` is a non-negative integer.
*   The third line assigns the sum of `x1` and `x2` to `y`. Since `x1` and `x2` are both integers, `y` is also an integer.
*   The fourth line assigns the value of `y` to `dp[len]`. Since `y` is an integer, `dp[len]` is now an integer.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and updates the values of any variables that are modified by the code. The value of `len` remains unchanged, and `dp[len]` is assigned a new value based on the calculations performed in the code.
