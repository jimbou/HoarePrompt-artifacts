Functionality: **This function calculates and returns a value based on the input 'len'. If 'len' is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1. If 'len' is a positive integer and is already in the collection 'dp', it returns the corresponding value from 'dp'. Otherwise, it calculates the value using recursive calls to a helper function and stores it in 'dp' before returning it. The calculated value is the sum of two parts: the result of the helper function called with 'len - 1', and twice the product of 'len - 1' and the result of the helper function called with 'len - 2'.**
