Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of different final configurations possible when continuing a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard after k moves. The game's rules ensure that no two rooks attack each other, and the computer mirrors the player's moves.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `helper`. The `func_1` function initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the input `x`. The `helper` function calculates and returns a value based on the input `len`.

The `helper` function uses dynamic programming to store and reuse previously calculated values in the `dp` dictionary. It calculates the value for a given `len` by recursively calling itself with `len - 1` and `len - 2`, and then combining the results.

The key to the correctness of the code lies in the calculation performed by the `helper` function. The value calculated for a given `len` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard of size `len x len` such that no two rooks attack each other.

The calculation `x1 = helper(len - 1)` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard of size `(len - 1) x (len - 1)`, which is the same as the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard of size `len x len` where the top-left corner is empty.

The calculation `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard of size `len x len` where the top-left corner is occupied by a rook. The factor `2 * (len - 1)` accounts for the fact that there are `len - 1` possible positions for the rook in the top row, and for each of these positions, there are `len - 1` possible positions for the rook in the left column.

The final result is the sum of `x1` and `x2`, which represents the total number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard of size `len x len` such that no two rooks attack each other.

The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

Correctness: **True**
