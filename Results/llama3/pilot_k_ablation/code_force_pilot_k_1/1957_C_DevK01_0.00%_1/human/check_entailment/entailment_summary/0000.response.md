Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to calculate the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the computer mirrors each move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position of the white rook.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of each move and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. If the coordinates of a move are different, it subtracts 2 from n; if they are the same, it subtracts 1 from n.

After updating n, the program calls the function func_1 with the updated value of n. The function func_1 initializes an empty dictionary dp and calls the helper function with the value of n. The helper function calculates the number of different final configurations possible using dynamic programming.

The helper function first checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1. If the length is already in the dictionary dp, it returns the corresponding value from dp. Otherwise, it calculates a new value using recursive calls to the helper function and stores it in dp before returning it.

The final result is printed for each test case.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the problem description. The functions work together to calculate the number of different final configurations possible in the game.

Correctness: **True**
