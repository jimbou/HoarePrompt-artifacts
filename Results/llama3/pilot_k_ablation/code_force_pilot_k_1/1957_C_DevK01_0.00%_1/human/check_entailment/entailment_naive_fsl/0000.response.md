Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to calculate the total number of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7, but the program does not handle the modulo operation correctly.

The program uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of possible configurations, but it does not consider the modulo operation in the recursive calls. This can lead to incorrect results for large inputs.

For example, if the input is n = 1000 and k = 4, the program will calculate the number of possible configurations as 671968183, but this is not the correct result modulo 10^9+7.

To fix this issue, the program should use a dynamic programming approach with modulo operation to calculate the number of possible configurations. The correct program should use the following formula:

dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]) % (10^9+7)

This formula ensures that the result is calculated modulo 10^9+7 at each step, avoiding overflow and incorrect results.
