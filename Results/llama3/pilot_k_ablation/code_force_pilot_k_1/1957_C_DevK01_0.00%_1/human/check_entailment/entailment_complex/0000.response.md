Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a chessboard and rooks. The problem requires determining the number of different final configurations possible when continuing a game after a certain number of moves. The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to calculate this number.

The main function takes the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k) as input. It then reads the coordinates of the moves played and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. Finally, it calls the function func_1 with the updated size of the chessboard and prints the result.

The function func_1 is not defined in the given code snippet, but based on the description, it seems to be a recursive function that calculates the number of possible final configurations. The function helper is also not defined, but it is likely a recursive function that calculates the number of possible configurations for a given size of the chessboard.

The function func_2 is a recursive function that calculates the number of possible configurations for a given size of the chessboard. It uses memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. The function returns the number of possible configurations, which is the sum of two parts: the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 1, and twice the product of len - 1 and the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 2.

Based on the description of the problem and the given code, it appears that the program is designed to correctly solve the problem. However, without the definition of the functions func_1 and helper, it is impossible to determine the correctness of the program with absolute certainty.

Correctness: **True**
