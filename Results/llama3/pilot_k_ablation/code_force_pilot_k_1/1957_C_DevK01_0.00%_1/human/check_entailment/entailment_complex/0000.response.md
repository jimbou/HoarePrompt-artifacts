Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving a chessboard and rooks. The program takes input for the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k), as well as the coordinates of the moves. It then calculates the number of possible final configurations of the board after all valid moves have been made.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `helper`. The `func_1` function takes the remaining number of valid moves (n) as input and calls the `helper` function to calculate the number of possible configurations. The `helper` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for a given number of valid moves.

The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the number of possible configurations. It takes into account the fact that the computer mirrors the player's moves, and it correctly handles the case where the player places a rook on a square that the computer cannot mirror.

The program also correctly uses dynamic programming to store and reuse previously calculated values, which improves its efficiency.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
