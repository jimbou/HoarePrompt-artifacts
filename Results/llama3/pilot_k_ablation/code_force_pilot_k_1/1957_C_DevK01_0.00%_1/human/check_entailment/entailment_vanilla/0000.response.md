Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The given program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `helper`. The `func_1` function is not used in the given code, so we can ignore it. The `helper` function is a recursive function that calculates the number of possible configurations for a given length.

The `helper` function uses a dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems. If the length is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1. If the length is already in the dictionary, it returns the stored result. Otherwise, it calculates the result by recursively calling itself with length-1 and length-2, and stores the result in the dictionary.

The program does not handle the input and output operations, but it correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for a given length.

However, the program does not consider the case where the computer cannot mirror the move, i.e., when r = c. In this case, the number of possible configurations is different. The program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
