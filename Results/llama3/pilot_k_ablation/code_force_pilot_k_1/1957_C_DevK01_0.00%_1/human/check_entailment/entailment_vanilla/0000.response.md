Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The game is played on an n x n chessboard, where we and the computer take turns placing white and black rooks respectively. The computer mirrors our moves, and if we place a rook on a position (r, c), the computer places a black rook at position (c, r). If r = c, the computer skips its turn.

The program provided uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The function `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function. The `helper` function takes an integer `len` as input and returns the number of different final configurations possible.

The `helper` function uses memoization to store the results of subproblems. If `len` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1. If `len` is already in the `dp` dictionary, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it calculates the result by recursively calling itself with `len - 1` and `len - 2` as inputs, and stores the result in the `dp` dictionary.

The calculation of the result is based on the fact that there are two possible moves for each position on the board: placing a white rook or placing a black rook. If we place a white rook at position (r, c), the computer will place a black rook at position (c, r). If r = c, the computer will skip its turn. Therefore, the number of different final configurations possible is the sum of the number of configurations possible when we place a white rook and the number of configurations possible when we place a black rook.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible by using dynamic programming and memoization. It takes into account the fact that the computer mirrors our moves and skips its turn when r = c.

Correctness: **True**
