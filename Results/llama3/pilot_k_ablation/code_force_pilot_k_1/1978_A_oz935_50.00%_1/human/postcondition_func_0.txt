This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it extracts the last integer and the largest of the remaining integers, and prints their sum. The function processes multiple test cases, as specified by an initial integer t, and does not return any value, only producing output for each test case.
