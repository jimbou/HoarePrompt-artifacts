Based on the initial state, the code will print the sum of the last integer in the original list and the second largest integer in the original list (excluding the last integer).

The value of `last` is the last integer in the original list, and the value of `other` is the second largest integer in the original list (excluding the last integer).

Output: **last + other (where last is the last integer in the original list and other is the second largest integer in the original list, excluding the last integer)**
