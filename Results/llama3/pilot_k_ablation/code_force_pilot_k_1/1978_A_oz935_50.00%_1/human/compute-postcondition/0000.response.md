The code `t = int(input().strip())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

In the initial state, the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the standard input. The standard input now contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
