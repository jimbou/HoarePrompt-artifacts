Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), ls is a list of n-2 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), last is the last integer in the original list, other is the second largest integer in the original list (excluding the last integer)**.

Explanation:

* The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). Stdin now contains `t-1` test cases.
* The second line reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `ls`. Since each test case consists of `n` integers, `ls` will be a list of `n` strings representing integers.
* The third line removes the last element from `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `last`. Since `ls` was a list of `n` integers, `last` will be the last integer in the original list.
* The fourth line sorts `ls` in ascending order, removes the last element (which is now the second largest integer), converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `other`. Since `ls` was a list of `n-1` integers (excluding the last integer), `other` will be the second largest integer in the original list (excluding the last integer).

Note that `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
