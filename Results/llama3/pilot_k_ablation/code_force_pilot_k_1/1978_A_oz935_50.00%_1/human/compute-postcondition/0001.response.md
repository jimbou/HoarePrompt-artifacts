To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to provide a more specific state, we can adjust `i` to be 0, as it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
