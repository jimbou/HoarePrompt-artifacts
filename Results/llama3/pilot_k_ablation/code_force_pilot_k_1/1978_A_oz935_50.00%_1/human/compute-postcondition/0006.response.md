Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it identifies the last integer and the second largest integer (excluding the last one), and prints their sum. The function processes multiple test cases as specified by the initial input t, and consumes all input from standard input.**
