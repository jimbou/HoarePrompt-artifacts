Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `ls`.
3. It removes the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer `last`. This is the number of pages in the last book.
4. It sorts the remaining list `ls` in ascending order and removes the last element (which is now the maximum element) and converts it to an integer `other`. This is the number of pages in the book with the highest number of pages in the first pile.
5. It prints the sum of `last` and `other`, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
