Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. However, the program only considers the last book and the maximum of the remaining books, which is not necessarily the optimal solution.

For example, in the test case with input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output 5 (3 + 2), but the correct answer is 5 (3 + 2) or 4 (2 + 2) or 3 (1 + 2), depending on how the books are divided into two piles.

The correct solution should sort the list of books in descending order and then sum the first two elements, which will give the maximum total number of pages Alice can read. 

Here is the correct code:

def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        print(ls[0] + ls[1])
