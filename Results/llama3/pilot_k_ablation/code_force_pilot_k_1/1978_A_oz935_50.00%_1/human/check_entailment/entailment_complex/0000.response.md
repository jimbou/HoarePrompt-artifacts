Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of book pages `ls`.
3. It correctly identifies the last book's pages `last` by popping the last element from the list `ls`.
4. It correctly identifies the second largest book's pages `other` by sorting the remaining list `ls` in ascending order and popping the last element (which is the largest element in the sorted list).
5. It correctly prints the sum of the last book's pages and the second largest book's pages for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of `sorted(ls).pop()` to find the second largest element is a clever trick, as it avoids the need to explicitly find the maximum element and then find the second largest element.

Correctness: **True**
