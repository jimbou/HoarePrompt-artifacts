Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of book pages `ls`.
3. It correctly extracts the last book page `last` by popping the last element from the list `ls`.
4. It correctly finds the largest book page `other` from the remaining books by sorting the list `ls` in ascending order and popping the last element (which is the largest).
5. It correctly prints the sum of `last` and `other` for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of `sorted(ls).pop()` to find the largest book page is a clever and efficient way to do so.

Correctness: **True**
