Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the largest number is not at the end of the list. For example, if the input is:

3
1 3 2

The program will output 5 (3 + 2), but the correct output should be 5 (3 + 2) as well, however the program is not guaranteed to give the correct answer in all cases. The program only checks the last element and the largest element in the rest of the list, but it does not consider the case where the largest element is not at the end of the list.

A correct solution would be to sort the list in descending order and then add the first two elements. Here is a correct implementation:

def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort(reverse=True)
        print(ls[0] + ls[1])
