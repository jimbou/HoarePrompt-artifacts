Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect the maximum number of coins. It simply counts the number of '@' characters in the string, which does not take into account the movement restrictions imposed by the '*' characters.

For example, consider the input:

5
..*@*

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0, because the '*' character blocks the path to the '@' character.

The program needs to be modified to correctly implement the movement logic and count the maximum number of coins that can be collected.
