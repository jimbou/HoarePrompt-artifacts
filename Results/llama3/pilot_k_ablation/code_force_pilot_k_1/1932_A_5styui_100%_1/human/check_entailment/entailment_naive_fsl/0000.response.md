Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect the maximum number of coins. The issue lies in the fact that it simply counts the number of '@' characters in the string, without considering the movement restrictions imposed by the '*' characters.

A counterexample is the input:

5
..*@*

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0, because the '*' character blocks the path to the '@' character.

The program should keep track of the current position and only move forward if the next cell is not a '*'. It should also only count the '@' characters if they are reachable from the current position.
