Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `b` is a string of at least 1 character, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', `j` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', and `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`. The current value of the character at index `j + 1` of string `b` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The character at index `j` of string `b` is still '*', and the character at index `j` of string `b` is still not '@'. The current value of the character at index `j + 1` of string `b` is still '*'.
