Output State: **`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and `j` is not equal to `len(b) - 1`. The character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, `a` is still an integer greater than 0, `s` is still 0, `i` is still 0, `d` is still an integer, `b` is still a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is still 0, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is still '*', and the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is still '*', and `j` is still not equal to `len(b) - 1`. The character at index `j+1` of string `b` is still '*'.
