Output State: **`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is equal to the length of string `b` minus 1, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the current loop or if statement.
