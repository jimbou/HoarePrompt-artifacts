Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `b` is a string of at least 1 character, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
