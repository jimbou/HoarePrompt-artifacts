The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases, `a` becomes equal to `t`. The second line initializes `s` to 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'.**
