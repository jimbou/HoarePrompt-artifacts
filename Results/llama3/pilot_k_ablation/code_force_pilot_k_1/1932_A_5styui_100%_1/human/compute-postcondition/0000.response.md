Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is an integer equal to the first test case number, s is 0**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `a`. Since stdin initially contains an integer `t` followed by `t` test cases, after this line, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. The second line initializes `s` to 0. No other variables are affected.
