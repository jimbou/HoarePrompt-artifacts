Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `b` is a string of at least 1 character, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', `j` is either 0 or equal to the last index of string `b`, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or if the character at index `j + 1` of string `b` is '*'. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and the program continues its execution.***
