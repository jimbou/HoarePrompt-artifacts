Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 1 if the current character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of string `b` minus 1, or the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '*' and not '@', the program continues execution.***
