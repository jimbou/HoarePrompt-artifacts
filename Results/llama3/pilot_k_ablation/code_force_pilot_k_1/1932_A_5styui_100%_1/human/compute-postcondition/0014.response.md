Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `b` is a string of at least 1 character, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', `j` is either 0 or equal to the last index of string `b`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@'. If `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the character at index `j + 1` of string `b` is '*', otherwise the program continues its execution.***
