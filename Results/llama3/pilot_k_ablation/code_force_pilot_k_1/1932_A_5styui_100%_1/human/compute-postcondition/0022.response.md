Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters in each string, but skips counting if the '@' character is followed by a '*' character. The function prints the count of '@' characters for each test case and resets the count for the next test case.**
