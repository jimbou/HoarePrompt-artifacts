Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters (representing coins) in each string, but stops counting if it encounters a '*' character (representing thorns) that is not at the end of the string or is followed by another '*'. The function prints the count of coins for each test case and resets the count for the next test case. If there are no test cases (i.e., the input integer a is 0), the function does not execute the loop and leaves the input unchanged.**
