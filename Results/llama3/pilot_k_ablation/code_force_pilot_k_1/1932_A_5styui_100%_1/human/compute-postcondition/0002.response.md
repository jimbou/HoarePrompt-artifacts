The code reads an integer `d` from the input and assigns it to the variable `d`. Then, it reads a string `b` from the input and assigns it to the variable `b`. The value of `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and the value of `b` is a string of `d` characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'.

Output State: **a is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), b is a string of d characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', stdin contains t-1 test cases**
