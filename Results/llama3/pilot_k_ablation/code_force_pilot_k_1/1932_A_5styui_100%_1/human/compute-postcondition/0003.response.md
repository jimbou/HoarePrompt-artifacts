To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of string `b`. If `b` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute.

Since `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), we know that `b` has at least 1 character. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `b` to have at least 1 character, and `j` to be 0 (since it's the starting index of the range).

The other variables `a`, `i`, `s`, and `stdin` are not relevant to the loop execution, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `b` is a string of at least 1 character, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', `j` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
