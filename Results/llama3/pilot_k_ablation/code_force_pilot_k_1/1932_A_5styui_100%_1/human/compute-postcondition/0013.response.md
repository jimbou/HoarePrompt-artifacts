Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and `j` is not equal to `len(b) - 1`. If the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
