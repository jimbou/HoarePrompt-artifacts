Output State: **`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is the number of '@' characters in string `b`, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string. If the string `b` contains a '*' character that is not followed by another '*' character and is not the last character in the string, the loop will break prematurely. Otherwise, the loop will iterate over the entire string `b`.**
