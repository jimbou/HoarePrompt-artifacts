Output State: **`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 1, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the current character at index `j` is '@', `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, `a` is still an integer greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `d` is still an integer, `b` is still a string with at least 1 character and the current character at index `j` is still '@', and `j` is still 0.
