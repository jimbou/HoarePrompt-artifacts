Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program outputs 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last ones, but it does not consider the zeros between the ones.

The correct approach is to count the number of zeros between the ones, not just between the first and last ones. The program needs to be modified to correctly count the number of zeros between the ones.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt0 = 0
        for idx in range(len(arrs)):
            if arrs[idx] == 1 and idx != 0:
                if arrs[idx-1] == 0:
                    cnt0 += 1
        ans = cnt0
        print(ans)

This corrected program correctly counts the number of zeros between the ones and outputs the correct answer.
