Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0 and the last element is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus one, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

The code decrements the value of `cnt0` by 1. The initial value of `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. Since the last element of `arrs` is 0, decrementing `cnt0` by 1 means that the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element is now one less than its initial value. The values of the other variables are not affected.
