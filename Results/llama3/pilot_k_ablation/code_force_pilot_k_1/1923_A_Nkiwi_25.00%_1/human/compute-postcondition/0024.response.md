Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of `t` integers, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `_` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, and the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` and `length` remain the same, `arrs` is still a list of `t` integers with the first element being 0 and the last element being 0. The count of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element is decreased by 1, and the count of ones remains the same. The value of `_` is still 0, and there are still 2t - 2 lines in stdin.
