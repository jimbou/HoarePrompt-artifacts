The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases. The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1).**
