To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arrs`. If `arrs` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `arrs` is a list of `t` integers, we can conclude that `arrs` must have at least 1 element.

At the start of the loop, `idx` should be 0, which is the first index of the list `arrs`.

The other variables `length`, `cnt0`, and `_` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of at least 1 integer, `cnt0` is 0, `_` is 0, `idx` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines**
