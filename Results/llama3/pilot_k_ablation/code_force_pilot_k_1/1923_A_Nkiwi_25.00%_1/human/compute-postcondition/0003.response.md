To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arrs`. If `arrs` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `idx` is 0**
