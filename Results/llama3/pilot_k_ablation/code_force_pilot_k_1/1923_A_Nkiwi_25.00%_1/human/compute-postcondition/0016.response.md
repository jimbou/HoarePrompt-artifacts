Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of `t` integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `_` is 0, `cnt1` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been initialized to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines.
