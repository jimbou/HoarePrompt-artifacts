Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `cnt1` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `cnt1` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
