Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of `t` integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `_` is 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. If `cnt1` is larger than 1, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` or `ans` is decreased by 1 depending on the value of `cnt1`.**
