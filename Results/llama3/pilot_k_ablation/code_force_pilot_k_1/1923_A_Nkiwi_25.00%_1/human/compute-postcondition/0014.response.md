Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `idx` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `idx` is 0, then if `arrs[0]` is equal to 1 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, if `arrs[0]` is equal to 1, `cnt0` remains 0. If `arrs[0]` is not equal to 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
