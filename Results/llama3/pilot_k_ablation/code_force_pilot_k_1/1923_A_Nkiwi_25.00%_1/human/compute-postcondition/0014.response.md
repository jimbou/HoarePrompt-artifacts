Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of at least 1 integer, `idx` is either 0 or not 0. stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt0` and `_` remain unchanged. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0, then if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the current value of the element of `arrs` at index `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` and `_` remain unchanged. If the first element of `arrs` is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
