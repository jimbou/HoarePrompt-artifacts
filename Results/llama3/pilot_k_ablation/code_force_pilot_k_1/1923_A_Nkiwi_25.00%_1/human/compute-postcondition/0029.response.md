Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs` and is either 0 or 1, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then the current value of `cnt0` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code `ans = 0` only reassigns the value of `ans` to 0, but the value of `ans` was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, no changes have been made to the state of the program.
