Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n binary digits (0s and 1s). It then calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the binary digits into a single block of 0s followed by a single block of 1s, or 0 if the input is already in this form or contains only one 1. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.**
