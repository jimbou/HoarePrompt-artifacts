Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum number of zeros required to separate blocks of ones and zeros in a given list of binary numbers. It takes no arguments and returns no value, instead printing the result directly. The function iterates over multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of binary numbers, and for each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of zeros required to separate the blocks.**
