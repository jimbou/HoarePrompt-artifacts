Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `idx` is not 0, and the first element of `arrs` is 0. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt0` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, and the first element of `arrs` remains 0, with the current value of `arrs[idx]` also being 0.
