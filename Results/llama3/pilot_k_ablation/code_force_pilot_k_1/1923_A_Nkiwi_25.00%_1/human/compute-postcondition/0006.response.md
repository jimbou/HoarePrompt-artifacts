Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of at least 1 integer, `cnt0` is 1, `_` is 0, `idx` is not 0. The first element of `arrs` is 0. stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `_`, and `idx`. The first element of `arrs` is still 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is also 0. The number of lines in stdin remains 2t - 2.
