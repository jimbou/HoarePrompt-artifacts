Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of at least 1 integer, `cnt0` is 1, `_` is 0, `idx` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. Either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. The current value of the first element of `arrs` is 1. The current value of the element of `arrs` at index `idx` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt0` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines, and the conditions regarding the first element of `arrs` and the value of the element at index `idx` remain the same.
