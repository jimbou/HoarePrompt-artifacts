Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `idx` is 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is still 0, and `idx` is still 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-1`.
