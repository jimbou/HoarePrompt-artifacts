Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of at least 1 integer, `idx` is not 0. The first element of `arrs` is 0. stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt0` and `_` remain unchanged.***
