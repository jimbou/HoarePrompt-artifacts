Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `idx` is not 0, and the first element of `arrs` is 0. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains unchanged.***
