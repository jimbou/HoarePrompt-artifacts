Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, a new variable `ans` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `cnt0` and the first and last elements of `arrs` are still applicable. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
