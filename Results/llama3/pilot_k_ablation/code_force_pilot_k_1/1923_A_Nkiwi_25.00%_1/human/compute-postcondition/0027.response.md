Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of `t` integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `_` is 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines. The condition regarding the first and last elements of `arrs` and the value of `cnt0` also remains the same.
