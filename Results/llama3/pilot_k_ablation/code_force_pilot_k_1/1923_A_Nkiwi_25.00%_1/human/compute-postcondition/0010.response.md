Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `idx` is 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, which means the first element of `arrs` is 0.**
