Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of `t` integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `_` is 0, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs` and is larger than 1, `ans` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `ans` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to the number of zeros in the list `arrs`, considering the special case where the first element is 0 and the last element is also 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
