Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of `t` integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `_` is 0, `cnt1` is 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, idx is 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt1` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` remains 1.
