Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `cnt1` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `idx` is 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt1` is now 1 because the initial value of `cnt1` was 0 and we incremented it by 1. The rest of the variables are still the same as in the initial state.
