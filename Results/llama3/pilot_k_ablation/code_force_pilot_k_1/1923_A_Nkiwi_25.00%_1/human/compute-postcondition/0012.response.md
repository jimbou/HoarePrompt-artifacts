Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `length` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `arrs` is a list of at least 1 integer, `idx` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. Either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. The current value of the first element of `arrs` is 1. If the current value of the element of `arrs` at index `idx` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` and `_` remain unchanged.***
