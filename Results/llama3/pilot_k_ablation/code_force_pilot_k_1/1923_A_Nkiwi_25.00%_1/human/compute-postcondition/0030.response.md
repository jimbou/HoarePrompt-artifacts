Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element is 0, or the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element is 1, `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. `cnt1` is greater than 1***
