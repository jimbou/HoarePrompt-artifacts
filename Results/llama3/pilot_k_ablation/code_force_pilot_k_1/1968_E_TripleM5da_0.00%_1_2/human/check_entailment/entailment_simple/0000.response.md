Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program is iterating over each test case, and for each test case, it is printing the coordinates of the cells that are supposed to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, the program is not correctly implementing the solution. The program is printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case, which is not correct for all values of n. The program is also printing the coordinates (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n + 1, which is also not correct.

The correct solution would involve printing the coordinates of the cells in a way that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. This would involve a more complex algorithm that takes into account the value of n and the properties of Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
