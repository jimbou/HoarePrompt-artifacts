Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid.

However, the program has a logical error. It always prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), regardless of the value of n. This is incorrect because for n > 2, these points do not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
