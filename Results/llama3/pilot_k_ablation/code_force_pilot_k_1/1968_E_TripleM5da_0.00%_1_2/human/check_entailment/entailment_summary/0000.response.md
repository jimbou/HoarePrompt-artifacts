Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a sequence of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not actually solve the problem correctly. The program simply prints a fixed sequence of points for each test case, regardless of the value of n. This sequence does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n.

In particular, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and then the points (i, i) for i from 3 to n + 1. However, this sequence does not take into account the actual structure of the grid and the possible Manhattan distances between points. For example, for n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), but the optimal solution is actually the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
