Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly implementing the strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The correct strategy is to place the cells in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

In this case, the program is not correctly implementing this strategy, and therefore, it is not working correctly for all potential cases.
