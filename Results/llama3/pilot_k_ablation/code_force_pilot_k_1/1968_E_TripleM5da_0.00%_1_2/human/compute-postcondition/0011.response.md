Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer between 2 and 10^3. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers, starting with 1 and 2, and then printing each number from 3 to the input number plus one, twice. The function processes between 1 and 50 test cases, as specified by the first input integer, and leaves the standard input empty after execution.**
