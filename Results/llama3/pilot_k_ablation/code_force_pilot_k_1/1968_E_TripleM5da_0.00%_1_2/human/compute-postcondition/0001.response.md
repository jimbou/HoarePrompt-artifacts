Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains n integers (greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The remaining input in stdin consists of `n` integers, each greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3.
