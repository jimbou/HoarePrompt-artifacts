Based on the precondition, the code will print the numbers 1 and 2.

Here's the explanation:

* The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but it's not used in the print statement.
* The variable `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, but it's not used in the print statement either.
* The stdin contains n integers, but they are not used in the print statement.
* The number 1 is printed twice, but this is not relevant to the print statement in question.

The print statement simply prints the numbers 1 and 2, regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, or the contents of stdin.

Output: **1 2**
