To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3. Since `n` is already between 1 and 50 inclusive, we can adjust `n` to be at least 3. Additionally, since `i` is used in the loop head, we can adjust its value to be 3, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains n integers (greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3), and the number 1 is printed twice, and this is printed: "1 2"**
