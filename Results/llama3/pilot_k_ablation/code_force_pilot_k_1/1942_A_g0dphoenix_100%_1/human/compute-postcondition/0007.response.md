The code prints a string containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. Since `n` is not equal to `k` and the current value of `k` is 1, the value of `n` is not explicitly provided. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
