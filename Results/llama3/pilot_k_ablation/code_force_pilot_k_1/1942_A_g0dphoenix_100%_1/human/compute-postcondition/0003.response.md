The code prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, excluding the last character. Since `n` is equal to `k` and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, the value of `n` is used to repeat the string '1 '.

Output: **'1 ' repeated [n] times, excluding the last character (where n is the current value of n which is equal to k)**
