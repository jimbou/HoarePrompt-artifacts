Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^3, and `k` is between 1 and `n`, respectively. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, since one line has been consumed by the input operation. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
