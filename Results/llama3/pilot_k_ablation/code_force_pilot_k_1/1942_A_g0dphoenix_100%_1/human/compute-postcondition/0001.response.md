Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the first two integers from the input, which are guaranteed to be within the specified ranges. The stdin now contains one less line, as the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
