Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), _ is 0, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k` is 1, the numbers from 1 to `n` are printed, separated by spaces. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
