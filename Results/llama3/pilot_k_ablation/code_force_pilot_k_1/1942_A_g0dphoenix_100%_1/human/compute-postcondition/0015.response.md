Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it prints a specific sequence of numbers based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, it prints a sequence of 1s repeated n times. If k equals 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n. If neither condition is met, it prints -1. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty.**
