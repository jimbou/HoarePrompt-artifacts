Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), _ is 0. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times, excluding the last space is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to n is printed, where each number is separated by a space. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
