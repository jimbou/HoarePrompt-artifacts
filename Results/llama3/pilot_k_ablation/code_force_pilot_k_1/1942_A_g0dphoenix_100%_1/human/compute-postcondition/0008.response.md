Output: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), _ is 0, and n is not equal to k. The current value of `k` is 1, and a string of numbers from 1 to n is printed, where each number is separated by a space**
