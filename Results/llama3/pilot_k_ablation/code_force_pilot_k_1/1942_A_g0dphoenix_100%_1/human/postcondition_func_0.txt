This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where each line contains two integers, n and k. For each line, it checks the values of n and k and prints a specific output based on their relationship. If n equals k, it prints a string of '1' repeated n times. If n does not equal k but k is 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to n. In all other cases, it prints -1. The function continues this process until all input lines have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.
