Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts, respectively.

3. If n is equal to k, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of 1s of length n, which satisfies the condition because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.

4. If k is equal to 1, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of consecutive integers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition because only one cyclic shift of this array is sorted (the original array itself).

5. If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the program cannot find an array that satisfies the given conditions. In this case, the program prints -1, indicating that no such array exists.

Based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program's logic seems to be correct. It handles all possible cases and provides the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
