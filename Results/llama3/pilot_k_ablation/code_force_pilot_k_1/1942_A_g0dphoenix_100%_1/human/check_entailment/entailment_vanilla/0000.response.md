Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) and for each test case, it reads the values of n and k.

2. If n is equal to k, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of 1's of length n, which satisfies the condition because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.

3. If k is equal to 1, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array should be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of numbers from 1 to n in ascending order. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself) and all other cyclic shifts are not sorted.

4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that k is greater than 1 and less than n. In this case, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no array that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. The problem description states that if there is no such array a, output -1. The program correctly handles all possible cases and outputs -1 when there is no valid array.

Correctness: **True**
