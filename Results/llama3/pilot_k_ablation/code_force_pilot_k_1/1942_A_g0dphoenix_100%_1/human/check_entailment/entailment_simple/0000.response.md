Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  If `n` equals `k`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. This is only possible when all elements in the array are the same. Therefore, the program correctly prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, excluding the last space.

2.  If `n` is not equal to `k`, but `k` is 1, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array should be sorted. This is possible when the array is a sorted sequence of distinct numbers. Therefore, the program correctly prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, where each number is separated by a space.

3.  If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k` is not 1, it means that more than one cyclic shift of the array should be sorted, but not all of them. However, this is impossible because if one cyclic shift is sorted, all other cyclic shifts will also be sorted. Therefore, the program correctly prints -1 to indicate that there is no valid array.

Correctness: **True**
