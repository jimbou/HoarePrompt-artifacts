Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing `n` ones, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array of ones are sorted.
*   The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing the numbers from 2 to `n + 1`, which is a valid solution because only the original array (not any cyclic shift) is sorted.
*   The program correctly handles the case where `k > 1` and `n > k` by printing -1, which is correct because it's impossible to construct an array with more than one sorted cyclic shift and less than `n` sorted cyclic shifts.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
