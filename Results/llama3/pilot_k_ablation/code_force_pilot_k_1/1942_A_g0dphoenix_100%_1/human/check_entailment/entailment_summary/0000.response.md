Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts. The program handles three cases:

1.  When n equals k, it prints a sequence of 1s repeated n times. This is correct because a sequence of identical numbers is always sorted, and there are n cyclic shifts of this sequence, all of which are sorted.
2.  When k equals 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n. This is correct because there is only one sorted cyclic shift of this sequence, which is the sequence itself.
3.  When neither condition is met, it prints -1. This is correct because, according to the problem statement, if there is no such array a, the program should output -1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
