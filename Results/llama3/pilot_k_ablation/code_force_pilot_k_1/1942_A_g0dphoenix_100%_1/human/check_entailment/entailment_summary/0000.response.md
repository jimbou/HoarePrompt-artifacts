Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where `n == k`. In this case, it prints a string of '1' repeated `n` times, which satisfies the condition that all `n` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
2.  The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1`. In this case, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.
3.  The program correctly handles all other cases by printing -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program's logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
