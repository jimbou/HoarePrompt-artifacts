Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case when `n == k`. In this case, it prints a sequence of 1s repeated `n` times, which satisfies the condition that all `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.

2.  The program correctly handles the case when `k == 1`. In this case, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted (the one starting from the smallest number).

3.  The program correctly handles the case when `n != k` and `k != 1`. In this case, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. This is because if `k` is greater than 1, it's impossible to construct an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

4.  The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.

5.  The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
