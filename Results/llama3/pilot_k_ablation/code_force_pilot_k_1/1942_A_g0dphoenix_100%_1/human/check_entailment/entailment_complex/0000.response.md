Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts. The program takes input from the standard input, where each line contains two integers, n and k.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1.  When n equals k, it prints a string of '1' repeated n times, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.
2.  When k is 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to n, which is a valid solution because only one cyclic shift of this array is sorted (the original array itself).
3.  For all other cases, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid solution.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
