Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program prints -1, but a valid array a = [1, 2, 3] exists, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 1].

The program only handles the cases where n = k, k = 1, or prints -1 for all other cases. However, there are other cases where a valid array a exists, but the program does not provide a correct solution.
