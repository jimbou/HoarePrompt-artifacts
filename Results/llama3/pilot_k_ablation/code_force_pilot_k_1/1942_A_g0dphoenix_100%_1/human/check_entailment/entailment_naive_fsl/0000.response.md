Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n > k > 1. In this case, the program prints -1, but it is possible to construct an array that satisfies the conditions. For example, when n = 4 and k = 2, the array [1, 2, 3, 1] has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2, 3]. However, the program prints -1 for this case.

The program only handles the cases when n = k or k = 1, but it does not provide a correct solution for the case when n > k > 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
