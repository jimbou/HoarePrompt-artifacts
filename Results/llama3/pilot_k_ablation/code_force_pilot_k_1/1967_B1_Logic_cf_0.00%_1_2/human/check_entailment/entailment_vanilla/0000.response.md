Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. For each `b`, it adds `n // b + 1` to the answer `ans`. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem statement requires that `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`. The program does not take into account the `gcd(a,b)` part of the condition. It simply adds `n // b + 1` to the answer, which is not a correct way to count the number of ordered pairs satisfying the given conditions.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case when `a` and `b` are equal. In this case, `a+b` is always a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`, but the program does not account for this.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
