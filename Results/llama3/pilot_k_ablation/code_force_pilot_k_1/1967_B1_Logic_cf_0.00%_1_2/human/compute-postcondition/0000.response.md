The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, it is now equal to the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6**
