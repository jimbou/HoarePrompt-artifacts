Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates the sum of n // b + 1 for all b in the range from 1 to the minimum of n and m (inclusive), and prints this sum. The function iterates over all test cases and prints the calculated sum for each case.**
