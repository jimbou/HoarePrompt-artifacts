To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `T` is now 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0**
