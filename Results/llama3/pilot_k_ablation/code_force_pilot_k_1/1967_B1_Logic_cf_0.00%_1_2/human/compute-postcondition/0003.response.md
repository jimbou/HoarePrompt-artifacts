To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 1, since `b` starts from 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `n` and `m` to ensure that their minimum value is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `b` is 1**
