Output: **t is an integer and is greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element from arr and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in arr, stdin contains no input. If n is 0, ans is 0 and once is False. If n is greater than 0, ans is the smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) is 0, or the smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, or the second smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) is 1. once is True if there is at least one index i such that counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once was initially False, otherwise once is False, and ans is printed**
