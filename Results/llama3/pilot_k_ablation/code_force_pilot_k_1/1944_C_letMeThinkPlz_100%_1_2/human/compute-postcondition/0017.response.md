Postcondition: ***t is an integer and is greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element from arr and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in arr, stdin contains no input. If the frequency of the element at index i in arr is 1 and once is False, then ans is 1 and once is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
