Output State: **t is an integer and is greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `counter`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Stdin is now empty as all inputs have been consumed.
