Output State: **t is an integer and is greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element from arr and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in arr, ans is 1, once is True, stdin contains no input, and the frequency of the element at index i in arr is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `once` to `True`, changing its initial state from `False` to `True`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
