According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer and is greater than 0, n is an integer, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the variable i is the first element in the list.
State: **t is an integer and is greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input, i is the first element in the list**
