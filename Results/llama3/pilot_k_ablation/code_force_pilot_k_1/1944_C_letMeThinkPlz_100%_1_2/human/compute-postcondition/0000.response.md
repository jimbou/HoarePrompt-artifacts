The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The first input of each test case is an integer, which is assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs are lists of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one input: a list of integers (0 <= integer < 2 * 10^5).**
