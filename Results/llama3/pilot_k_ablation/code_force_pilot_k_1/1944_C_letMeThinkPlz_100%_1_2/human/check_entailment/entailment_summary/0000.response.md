Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` that Alice constructs during the game. The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`. It then iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to `n` (the size of the input array) and checks the count of each number in the `counter` dictionary.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1. If a number `i` is not present in the input array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
2. If a number `i` is present only once in the input array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and it's the first time it encounters a number with a count of 1 (i.e., `not once`), it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and sets `once` to `True`.
3. If a number `i` is present only once in the input array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and it's not the first time it encounters a number with a count of 1 (i.e., `once` is `True`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

The program correctly prints the MEX of the array `c` that Alice constructs during the game, which is the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array or is present only once.

Correctness: **True**
