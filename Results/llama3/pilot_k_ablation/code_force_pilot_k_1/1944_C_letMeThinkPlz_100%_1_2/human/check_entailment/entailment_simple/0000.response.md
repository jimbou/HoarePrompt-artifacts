Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array using a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number appears only once and it's the first time it sees a number with a count of 1, it sets the answer to the next number and continues. If it sees a number with a count of 1 again, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop.

This strategy works because Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of her array. If a number is not present in the array, Alice can choose that number to maximize the MEX. If a number appears only once, Alice can choose that number to maximize the MEX, but only if it's the first time she sees a number with a count of 1. If she sees a number with a count of 1 again, she should choose the current number to maximize the MEX.

Correctness: **True**
