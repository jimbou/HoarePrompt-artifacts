Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number is present only once and it's the first time it encounters a number with a count of 1, it sets the answer to the next number. If a number is present only once and it's not the first time it encounters a number with a count of 1, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop.

This strategy is correct because Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she wants to include as many numbers as possible in her array. By choosing the numbers with the highest counts first, she ensures that she includes as many numbers as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the score, which means he wants to remove as many numbers as possible from the array. By removing the numbers with the highest counts first, he ensures that he removes as many numbers as possible.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where the array contains only one number, where the array contains only two numbers, and where the array contains multiple numbers with different counts. Therefore, the program is correct.
