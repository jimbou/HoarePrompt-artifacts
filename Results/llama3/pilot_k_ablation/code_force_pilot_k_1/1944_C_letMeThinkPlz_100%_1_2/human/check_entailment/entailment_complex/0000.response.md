Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number is present only once and it's the first time it encounters such a number, it sets the answer to the next number and continues. If a number is present only once and it's not the first time it encounters such a number, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop.

This strategy is correct because Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she wants to include as many numbers as possible in her array c. Bob wants to minimize the score, which means he wants to exclude as many numbers as possible from Alice's array c. By following this strategy, Alice can ensure that she includes all numbers that are present more than once in the array, and Bob can ensure that he excludes all numbers that are present only once in the array.

Correctness: **True**
