Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a sequence of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program first prints the points (n, n) and (n, n-1), which ensures that the Manhattan distance between these two points is n-1. Then, if n is 3, it prints the point (2, 1), which ensures that the Manhattan distance between this point and the previous two points is 2 and 1, respectively. For n greater than 3, the program prints the points (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-1, which ensures that the Manhattan distance between these points and the previous points is i and n-i, respectively.

The program's strategy is to place the points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. By placing the points (n, n) and (n, n-1) first, the program ensures that the Manhattan distance between these two points is n-1, which is the maximum possible distance. Then, by placing the points (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-1, the program ensures that the Manhattan distance between these points and the previous points is i and n-i, respectively, which are all distinct.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
