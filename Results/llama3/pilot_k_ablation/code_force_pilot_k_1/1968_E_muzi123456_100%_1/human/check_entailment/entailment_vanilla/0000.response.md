Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints out the coordinates of n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads an integer t, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the program reads an integer n, which represents the size of the grid.
3. The program then prints out the coordinates of n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program uses a simple strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. It places the first point at the top-right corner of the grid (n, n), the second point at the top-left corner (n, n-1), and the remaining points at the bottom-left corner (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-1.

This strategy ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of points is unique, thus maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the case where n is 3, the program prints out the coordinates (2, 1) instead of (1, 1). This is incorrect because the point (2, 1) is not at the bottom-left corner of the grid.

Despite this small issue, the program is generally correct and should produce the correct output for most inputs.

Correctness: **False**
