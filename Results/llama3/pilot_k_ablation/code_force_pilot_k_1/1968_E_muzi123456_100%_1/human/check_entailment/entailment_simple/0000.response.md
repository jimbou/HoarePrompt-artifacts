Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in the format "x y", where x and y are the row and column indices of the cell, respectively.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. For each test case, it prints the coordinates of the cells in a specific pattern that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The pattern is as follows:

* For n = 2, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2).
* For n = 3, the program prints the coordinates (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1).
* For n >= 4, the program prints the coordinates (n, n), (n, n-1), and then the coordinates (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-2.

This pattern ensures that the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
