Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t integers n, each representing the size of a sequence to be printed.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances can be achieved by placing cells in a specific pattern. The pattern starts with two cells at positions (n, n) and (n, n-1), followed by a sequence of cells at positions (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-1. If n is 3, the program prints a special case (2, 1) instead of the sequence.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given problem, and it correctly handles the special case for n = 3. The program's logic is also consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
