Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program outputs:

4 4
4 3
1 1
1 2

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of \mathcal{H}. A correct arrangement for n = 4 would be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

This arrangement has a larger size of \mathcal{H}.

The program's logic is incorrect, and it does not handle all cases correctly. It only works for a few specific cases, but it does not have a general solution for all n.
