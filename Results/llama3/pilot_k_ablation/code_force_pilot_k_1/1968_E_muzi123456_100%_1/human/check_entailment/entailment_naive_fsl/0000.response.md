Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program outputs:

4 4
4 3
1 1
1 2
2 2

However, this is not the optimal arrangement, as the Manhattan distance between (1,1) and (2,2) is 2, which is already present in the set. A better arrangement would be:

4 4
4 3
1 1
3 1

This arrangement has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's logic is incorrect, as it simply prints the same pattern for all n, without considering the optimal arrangement for each case.
