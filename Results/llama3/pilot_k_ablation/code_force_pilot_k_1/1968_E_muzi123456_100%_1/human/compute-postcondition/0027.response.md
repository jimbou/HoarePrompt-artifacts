Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of a sequence to be printed. For each test case, the function prints a sequence of numbers in a specific pattern, starting with n, then n, then n-1, and finally a sequence of numbers from 1 to n-1, with each number repeated twice. If n is 3, the function prints 2 and 1 instead of the sequence. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the input variables t and n are left in a state where t is 0 and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).**
