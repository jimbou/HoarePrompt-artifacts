Functionality: **This function reads a positive integer (t) from standard input, followed by t number of positive integers (n), each less than or equal to 1000. It then prints a specific pattern of numbers for each n, including n, n-1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n-1, with some variations for n=3. After processing all inputs, the function leaves the standard input empty and the variable t as 0.**
