The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `n` which is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive is being printed, and `n` is printed, and the value of `n` which is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive is printed followed by a space, and `n-1` is printed, and `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 1**
