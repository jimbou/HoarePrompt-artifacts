The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it a non-negative integer. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is less than or equal to 1000, `n` becomes an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. Stdin is now empty.

Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive, stdin is empty**
