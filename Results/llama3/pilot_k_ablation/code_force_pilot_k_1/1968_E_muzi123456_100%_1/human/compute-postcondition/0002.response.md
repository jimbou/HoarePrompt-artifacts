Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 integers**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive). The value of `n` has been assigned the integer value of the input, which is between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-1` integers, as one integer has been consumed by the `input()` function.
