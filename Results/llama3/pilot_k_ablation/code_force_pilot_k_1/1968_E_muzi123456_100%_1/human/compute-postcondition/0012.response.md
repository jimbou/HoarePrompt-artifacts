Based on the initial state, the code `print(2, end=' ')` will print the number 2 followed by a space.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The `print` function is called with two arguments: `2` and `end=' '`.
* The `2` is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.
* The `end=' '` argument specifies that a space character should be printed after the number 2.

Since the value of `n` is not used in the print statement, its value (which is 3) is not relevant to the output.

Output: **2 **
