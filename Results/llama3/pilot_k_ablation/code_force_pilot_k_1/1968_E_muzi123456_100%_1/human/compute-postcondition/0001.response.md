The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), which means `t` is already not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` integers `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^3)**
