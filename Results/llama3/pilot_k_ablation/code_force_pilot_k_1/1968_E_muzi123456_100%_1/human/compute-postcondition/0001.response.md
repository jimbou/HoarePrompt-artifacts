According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already not equal to 0. Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: t number of integers (n), where n is less than or equal to 1000**
