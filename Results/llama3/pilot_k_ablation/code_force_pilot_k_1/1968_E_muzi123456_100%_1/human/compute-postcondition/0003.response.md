Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). The `print` statement is printing the value of `n` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Since `n` is an integer within the specified range, the output will be the actual value of `n` followed by a space.

Output: **[n] (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^3)**
