Based on the initial state, the code `print(n)` will print the value of `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't provide a precise numerical value. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **n (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive)**
