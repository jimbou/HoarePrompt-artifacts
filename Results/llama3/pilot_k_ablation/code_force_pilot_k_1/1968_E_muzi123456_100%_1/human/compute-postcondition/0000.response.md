The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer, the value of `t` is now a positive integer. The stdin now contains one input: t number of integers (n). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: t number of integers (n), where n is less than or equal to 1000.**
