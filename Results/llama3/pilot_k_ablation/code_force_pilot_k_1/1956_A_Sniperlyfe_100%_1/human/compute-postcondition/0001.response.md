The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, p is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, and the values in p are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than before does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, and the values in p are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than before, `_` is 0**
