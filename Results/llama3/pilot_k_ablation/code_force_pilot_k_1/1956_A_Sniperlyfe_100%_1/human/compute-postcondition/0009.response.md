Functionality: **This function calculates the number of players remaining in a range from 1 to 100 after removing players specified in the input list `p`. It takes a sorted list of distinct integers between 1 and 100 as input and returns a list of 101 integers, where each value at index `n` represents the number of players remaining after removing players in `p` from the range `[1, n]`. The function effectively updates the state of the program by providing the remaining players count for each range from 1 to 100, considering the removed players in `p`.**
