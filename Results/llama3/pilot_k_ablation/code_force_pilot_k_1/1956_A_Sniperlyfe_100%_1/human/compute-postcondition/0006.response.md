Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= min(p) <= max(p) <= 100 and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `max_n` is greater than 0, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where the value at index `n` is `cur_n` and the rest are zeros, `n` is 1, `cur_n` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `min(p)`**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players` at index `n` (which is 1) is updated to `cur_n`, which is calculated as 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `min(p)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
