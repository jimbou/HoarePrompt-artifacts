Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[n]` is `cur_n` and the rest are zeros, `n` is 1, `cur_n` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `min(p)`**

In this output state, the list `remaining_players` has been updated such that the `n`-th index now holds the value of `cur_n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `p` still contains distinct integers within the range 1 to 100, and `max_n` remains 100. The value of `n` is still 1, and `cur_n` is still calculated as 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
