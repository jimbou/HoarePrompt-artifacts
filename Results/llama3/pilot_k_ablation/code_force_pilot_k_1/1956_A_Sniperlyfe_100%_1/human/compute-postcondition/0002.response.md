Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, and the values in p are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, results is a list containing one string, which is a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty, _ is 0, k is an integer, q is an integer, qs is a list of integers, remaining_players is a list of integers**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the list `p` still contains distinct integers in ascending order, with values between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The value of `t` remains greater than 0. The `results` list now contains one string, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin is empty, as all inputs have been consumed. The variable `_` remains 0. The variables `k` and `q` have been assigned integer values from the input. The list `qs` contains a list of integers from the input. The variable `remaining_players` has been assigned a list of integers, which is the result of calling the function `func_1` with the list `p` as an argument.
