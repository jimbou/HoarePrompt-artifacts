Output State: **p is a list of integers, qs is a list of integers, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing one string, stdin is empty, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers**

In this output state, the initial values of `p`, `qs`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains one string, which is a space-separated list of integers. The `stdin` is empty because all inputs have been consumed. The new variables `k` and `q` are integers, and `remaining_players` is a list of integers returned by the `func_1` function.
