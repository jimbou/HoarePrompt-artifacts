Functionality: **This function takes a list of distinct integers in ascending order (between 1 and 100 inclusive) and a list of queries as input, processes the list using the func_1 function, and returns a list of strings where each string is a space-separated list of integers corresponding to the queries. The function performs this operation for a specified number of test cases (t) and returns the results as a list of strings.**
