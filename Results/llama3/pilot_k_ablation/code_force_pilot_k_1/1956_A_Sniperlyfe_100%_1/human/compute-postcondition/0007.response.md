Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= min(p) <= max(p) <= 100 and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where the value at index `n` is the number of players remaining after the players in `p` have been removed from the range `[1, n]` for each `n` from 1 to `max_n`.**
