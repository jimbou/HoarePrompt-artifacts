Output State: **p is a list of integers, qs is a list of integers, and the values in qs are indices of the list returned by func_1(p), t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. So now stdin only contains one less integer now. The second line assigns an empty list to `results`. The values of `p` and `qs` are not affected.
