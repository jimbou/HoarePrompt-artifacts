Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers in ascending order, and the values in p are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than before.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` was not previously defined, it now holds the value of the input. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected. The value of `p` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
