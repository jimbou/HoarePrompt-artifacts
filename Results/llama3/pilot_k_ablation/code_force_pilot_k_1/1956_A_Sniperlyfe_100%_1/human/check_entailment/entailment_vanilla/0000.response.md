Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of integers `p` as input and returns a list `remaining_players` that represents the number of players remaining after the game ends for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.

2. `func_1` uses a loop to iterate over each possible initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100. For each `n`, it simulates the game by repeatedly subtracting the number of players that would be kicked out in each round until no more players are kicked out.

3. The number of players kicked out in each round is determined by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the current number of players `cur_n`. This is done using the `bisect.bisect_right` function, which returns the index where `cur_n` would be inserted in `p` to maintain sorted order.

4. After simulating the game for each initial number of players, `func_1` returns the `remaining_players` list.

5. `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` to get the `remaining_players` list, and then uses this list to answer the queries. For each query `n`, it simply looks up the corresponding value in the `remaining_players` list.

6. Finally, `func_2` returns the results as a list of strings, where each string represents the answers to the queries for a single test case.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly simulates the game for each possible initial number of players and uses the results to answer the queries.

Correctness: **True**
