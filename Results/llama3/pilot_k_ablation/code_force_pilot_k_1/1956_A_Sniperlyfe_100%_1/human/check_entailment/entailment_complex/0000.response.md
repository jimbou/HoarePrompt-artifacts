Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the game logic and calculates the number of players remaining after removing players with numbers less than or equal to a given number, for all numbers from 1 to 100. The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and queries for each test case.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of players remaining after removing players with numbers less than or equal to a given number, for all numbers from 1 to 100. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the number of players to remove at each step.

The `func_2` function correctly accepts a series of inputs, applies the `func_1` function to the player scores, and uses the query indices to extract specific scores from the result. It returns a list of strings, where each string contains the extracted scores for a test case, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
