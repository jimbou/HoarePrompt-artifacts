Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where players are removed from a game based on a sequence of integers. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the number of players remaining in a range from 1 to 100 after removing players specified in the input list `p`. It takes a sorted list of distinct integers between 1 and 100 as input and returns a list of 101 integers, where each value at index `n` represents the number of players remaining after removing players in `p` from the range `[1, n]`.

`func_2` takes a list of distinct integers in ascending order (between 1 and 100 inclusive) and a list of queries as input, processes the list using the `func_1` function, and returns a list of strings where each string is a space-separated list of integers corresponding to the queries. The function performs this operation for a specified number of test cases (t) and returns the results as a list of strings.

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The functions work together to solve the problem by first calculating the remaining players for each range from 1 to 100 and then using these results to answer the queries.

Correctness: **True**
