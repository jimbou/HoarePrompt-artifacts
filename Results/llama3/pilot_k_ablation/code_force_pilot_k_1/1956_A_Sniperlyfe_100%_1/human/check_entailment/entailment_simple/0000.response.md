Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. It first calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players (from 1 to 100) using the `func_1` function. This function uses a while loop to simulate the game rounds, removing players with numbers less than or equal to the current number of players, and uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to efficiently count the number of players to remove in each round.

The `func_2` function then reads the input, calls `func_1` to get the list of remaining players, and uses this list to answer the queries. It simply looks up the number of remaining players for each query in the list returned by `func_1`.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of players is less than the minimum player number in the sequence `a`, as described in the problem statement. In this case, the number of remaining players is simply the initial number of players.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
