Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and calculates the number of players remaining after each round. The use of the `bisect` module to find the number of players to remove in each round is efficient and accurate. The program also correctly handles the case where there are no players left to remove in a round.

The program's structure is also clear and easy to follow. The `func_1` function calculates the number of players remaining after the players in `p` have been removed from the range `[1, n]` for each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, and the `func_2` function uses this result to calculate the number of players remaining for each query `n` in `qs`.

Correctness: **True**
