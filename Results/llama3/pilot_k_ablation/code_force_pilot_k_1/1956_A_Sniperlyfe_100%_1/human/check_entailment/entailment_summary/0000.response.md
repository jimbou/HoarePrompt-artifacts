Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on a sequence of integers and the number of players initially in the game.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of players remaining after removing players with numbers less than or equal to a given number, for all numbers from 1 to 100. It takes a list of distinct integers representing player numbers and returns a list of 101 integers, where each integer at index n represents the number of players remaining after removing players with numbers less than or equal to n.

Function `func_2` accepts a series of inputs: the number of test cases, and for each test case, the number of players, the number of queries, a list of player scores, and a list of query indices. It processes these inputs by applying the `func_1` function to the player scores, then uses the query indices to extract specific scores from the result. The function returns a list of strings, where each string contains the extracted scores for a test case, separated by spaces.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements by using `func_1` to calculate the remaining players for each test case and then using `func_2` to process the inputs and extract the required scores.

Correctness: **True**
