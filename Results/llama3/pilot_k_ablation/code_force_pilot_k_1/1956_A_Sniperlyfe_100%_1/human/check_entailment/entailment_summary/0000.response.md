Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on a sequence of integers and the number of players initially in the game.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of players remaining in a range from 1 to 100 after removing players specified in the input list `p`. It takes a sorted list of distinct integers between 1 and 100 as input and returns a list of 101 integers, where each value at index `n` represents the number of players remaining after removing players in `p` from the range `[1, n]`.

Function `func_2` takes a list of distinct integers in ascending order (between 1 and 100 inclusive) and a list of queries as input, processes the list using the `func_1` function, and returns a list of strings where each string is a space-separated list of integers corresponding to the queries.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements by using `func_1` to calculate the remaining players for each range from 1 to 100 and then using these results to answer the queries in `func_2`. The program also handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
