Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program uses a clever approach to precompute the number of remaining players for each possible number of initial players (from 1 to 100) and stores the results in the `remaining_players` array. This array is then used to quickly answer the queries for each test case.

The `func_1` function correctly simulates the game for each possible number of initial players and stores the results in the `remaining_players` array. The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1` to precompute the results, and then uses the precomputed results to answer the queries for each test case.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including the cases where the number of initial players is 1, the number of queries is 1, and the sequence `a` contains only one element.

The use of the `bisect` module to efficiently find the number of players that need to be removed in each round is also a good optimization.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
