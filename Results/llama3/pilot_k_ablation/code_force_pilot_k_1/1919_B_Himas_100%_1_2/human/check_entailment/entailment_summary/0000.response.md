Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and printing the absolute difference between these counts.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the minimum penalty is achieved when the arrays b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are split such that the sum of each array is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the minimum penalty is achieved when the sum is either 1 or -1.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and printing the absolute difference between these counts. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty for the given test case.

Correctness: **True**
