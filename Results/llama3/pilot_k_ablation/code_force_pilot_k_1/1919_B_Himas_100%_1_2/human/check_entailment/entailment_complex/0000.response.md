Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string, and prints this difference for each test case.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It iterates over each character in the string, increments the 'P' counter for '+' characters and the 'M' counter for '-' characters, and then prints the absolute difference between 'P' and 'M'.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the number of test cases and the string for each test case, and printing the result for each test case.

There are no obvious errors or edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. The program is also well-structured and easy to understand.

Correctness: **True**
