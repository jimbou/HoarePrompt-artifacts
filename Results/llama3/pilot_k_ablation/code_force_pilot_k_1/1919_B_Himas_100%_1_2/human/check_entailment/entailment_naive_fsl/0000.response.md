Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and then printing the absolute difference between these two counts.

The problem description states that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In this case, the sum of the array is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, and the length is the total number of characters.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the input string contains only '+' characters, the penalty is 0.
* When the input string contains only '-' characters, the penalty is 0.
* When the input string contains a mix of '+' and '-' characters, the penalty is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program also handles edge cases, such as:

* When the input string is empty, the penalty is 0.
* When the input string contains only one character, the penalty is 1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
