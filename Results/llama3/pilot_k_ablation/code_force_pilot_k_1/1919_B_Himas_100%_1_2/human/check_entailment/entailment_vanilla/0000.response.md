Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `e` itself. It then initializes two variables `P` and `M` to 0, which are used to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.

The program then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '+', it increments `P` by 1, and if the character is '-', it increments `M` by 1. Finally, it prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The reasoning behind this program is that the minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so a subarray with a sum of 1 or -1 will have a penalty of 1 or -1, respectively.

By counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, the program can determine the minimum possible penalty. If the number of '+' characters is greater than the number of '-' characters, the minimum possible penalty is the difference between the two counts. If the number of '-' characters is greater than the number of '+' characters, the minimum possible penalty is the difference between the two counts multiplied by -1. If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the minimum possible penalty is 0.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case.
