Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string and prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and does not return any value.**
