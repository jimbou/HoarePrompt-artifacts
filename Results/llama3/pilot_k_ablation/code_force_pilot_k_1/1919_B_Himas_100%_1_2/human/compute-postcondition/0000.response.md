The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the `input()` function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()` function. If `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
