Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `i` is 0, and `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `q` is not '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `M` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, `s` is still an integer greater than 0, `e` is still a string with at least 1 character, `P` is still 0, `i` is still 0, and `q` is still the first character in the string `e` and not '+'.
