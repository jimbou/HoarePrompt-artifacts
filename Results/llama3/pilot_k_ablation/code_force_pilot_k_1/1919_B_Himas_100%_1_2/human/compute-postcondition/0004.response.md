Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the first character of the string `e` is '+', `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The first character of the string `e` is still '+'.
