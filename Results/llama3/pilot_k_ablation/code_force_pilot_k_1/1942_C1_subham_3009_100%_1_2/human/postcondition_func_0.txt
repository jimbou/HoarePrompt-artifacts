This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of x distinct integers. It calculates the answer for each test case as x-2 plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in the sorted list of x integers that have a difference of 2, and prints the answer. The function processes all test cases and updates the values of n, x, and y to the values from the last test case, leaving the input empty.
