The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `ans` was `x-2`, so the new value of `ans` is `x-1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x integers, ans is x-1, i is 1, and the difference between the current element at index i and the previous element at index i-1 in arr is exactly 2.
