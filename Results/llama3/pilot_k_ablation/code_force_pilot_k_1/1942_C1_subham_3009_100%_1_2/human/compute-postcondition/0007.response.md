Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x integers, i is 1, and ans is x-2 if the difference between the current element at index i and the previous element at index i-1 in arr is not exactly 2. Otherwise, ans is x-1***
