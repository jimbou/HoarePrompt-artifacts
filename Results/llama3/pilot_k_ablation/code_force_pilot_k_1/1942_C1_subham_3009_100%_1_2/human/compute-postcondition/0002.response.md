To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `t > 0`. The state provided right before the loop is that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and stdin contains `t` test cases. However, the value of `t` itself does not need adjustment because it is already defined as being within a range that includes values greater than 0.

Given the condition `t > 0`, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 10^4, it inherently satisfies the condition `t > 0`. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of stdin containing `t` test cases does not affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, as the loop condition only depends on the value of `t`, not on the contents of stdin.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases.**
