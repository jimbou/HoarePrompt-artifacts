Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x integers, ans is x-2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and `t-1` test cases remain in stdin. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned from the input. The list `arr` has been created by taking `x` integers from the input, sorting them, and appending the sum of `n` and the first element of the sorted list. The variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `x-2`.
