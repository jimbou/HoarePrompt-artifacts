The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `x-2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` that have a difference of 2.

Since `x` is an integer and `arr` is a sorted list of `x` integers, the value of `ans` depends on the specific elements in `arr`. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the value of `ans` as follows:

`ans` is equal to `x-2` (where `x` is the number of elements in the list `arr`) plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `arr` that have a difference of 2.

Output: **x-2 plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in arr that have a difference of 2 (where x is the number of elements in the list arr)**
