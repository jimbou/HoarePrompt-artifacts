The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it more specific, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, stdin contains n lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
