Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `a` is not less than `b`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, and this is printed: the value of `b` which is an integer between 0 and 9 and the value of `a` which is an integer between 0 and 9**
