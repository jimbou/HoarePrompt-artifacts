The code prints the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9, where `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not equal to `b`. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `b` and `a` in the specified order.

Output: **b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9), a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9, not less than b, and not equal to b)**
