Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is 0, stdin contains n lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. Then, it assigns 0 to `t`. The value of `n` is used to determine the number of lines remaining in stdin, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).
