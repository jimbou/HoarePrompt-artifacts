Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). The current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`.**
