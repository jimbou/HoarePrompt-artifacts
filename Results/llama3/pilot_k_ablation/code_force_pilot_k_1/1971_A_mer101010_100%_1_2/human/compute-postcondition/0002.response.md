The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` accepts two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, there are at least `n` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers. The first line of input is assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `t` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
