The code prints the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9. Since the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`, the output will be a pair of integers where the first integer is less than the second integer.

Output: **a (an integer between 0 and 9), b (an integer between 0 and 9, where a < b)**
