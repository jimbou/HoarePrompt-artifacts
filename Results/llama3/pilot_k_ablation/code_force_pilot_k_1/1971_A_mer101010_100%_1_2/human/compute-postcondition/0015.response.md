Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is `n`, `t` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9. For each pair of `a` and `b` that were read from stdin, either `a` and `b` were printed if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, or `b` and `a` were printed if `a` is greater than `b`.**
