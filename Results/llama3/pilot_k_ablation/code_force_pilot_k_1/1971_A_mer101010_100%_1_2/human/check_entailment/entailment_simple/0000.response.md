Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y. It then uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the minimum and maximum of the two integers and prints them.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If a is less than b, it prints a and b.
- If a is equal to b, it prints a and b (since they are the same, it doesn't matter which one is printed first).
- If a is greater than b, it prints b and a.

The program also correctly iterates over the number of test cases (t) and reads the input for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
