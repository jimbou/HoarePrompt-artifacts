Reasoning:

1. The problem requires the program to read the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, read two integers (x and y) and output the minimum and maximum of these two integers.

2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case.

3. Inside the loop, it reads two integers (a and b) and checks their values.

4. If a is less than b, it prints a and b. If a is equal to b, it also prints a and b. If a is greater than b, it prints b and a.

5. This logic correctly covers all possible cases for the values of a and b, ensuring that the minimum value is always printed first, followed by the maximum value.

6. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from producing the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
