Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. It uses a simple if-elif-else statement to compare the values of x and y and prints the minimum followed by the maximum. The program handles all possible cases, including when x is less than y, when x is equal to y, and when x is greater than y. The program also correctly handles the case when x and y are both 0, and when x and y are both 9. The program's logic is sound and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
