Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which represents the maximum beauty of the array. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the maximum beauty is achieved by rearranging the elements in any way.

The program uses a list comprehension to calculate the sum of the differences, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this calculation. The program also handles multiple test cases correctly, reading the input for each test case and printing the result for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input, calculating the sum of the differences, and printing the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
