Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order, so that the differences are maximized.

The provided program correctly implements this approach. It reads the input, sorts the array in ascending order, and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension. The result is printed for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and leaving the standard input empty after execution.

Correctness: **True**
