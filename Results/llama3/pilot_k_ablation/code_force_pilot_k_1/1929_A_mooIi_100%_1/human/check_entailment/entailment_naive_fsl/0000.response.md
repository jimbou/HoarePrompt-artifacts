Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements in any way. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

The program first sorts the array in ascending order, which is a key step in solving this problem. By sorting the array, the program ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

The program then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this calculation.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the array has duplicate elements, cases where the array has negative elements, and cases where the array has a large number of elements.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
