Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements in any way. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

The program sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is the maximum beauty that can be obtained because the differences are maximized when the smallest element is subtracted from the largest element, the second smallest element is subtracted from the second largest element, and so on.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
* When there are only two elements, the beauty is the difference between the two elements.
* When there are multiple elements, the beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input array has only two elements or when all elements are equal.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
