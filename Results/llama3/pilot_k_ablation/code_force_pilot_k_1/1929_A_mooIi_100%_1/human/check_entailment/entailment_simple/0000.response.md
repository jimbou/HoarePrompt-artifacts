Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

The key step in the program is the sorting of the array elements in ascending order using the `sorted` function. This is done to ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

After sorting the array, the program calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension. The `range(1, n)` generates indices from 1 to `n-1`, and for each index `i`, it calculates the difference `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]`. The `sum` function then adds up these differences to give the maximum beauty of the array.

The program then prints the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it is clear that the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
