Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, sorts the array in ascending order, and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses the correct formulas to calculate the beauty of the array. The use of the `sorted` function to sort the array and the list comprehension to calculate the beauty of the array are efficient and Pythonic ways to solve the problem.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
