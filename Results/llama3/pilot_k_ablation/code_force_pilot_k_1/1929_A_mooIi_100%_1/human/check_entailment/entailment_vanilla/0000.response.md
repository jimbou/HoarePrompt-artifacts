Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.

3. It sorts the array in ascending order. This is a key step because the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized when the elements are in ascending order.

4. It then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension. This is done by subtracting each element from its previous element and summing up the results.

5. Finally, it prints the calculated sum, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
