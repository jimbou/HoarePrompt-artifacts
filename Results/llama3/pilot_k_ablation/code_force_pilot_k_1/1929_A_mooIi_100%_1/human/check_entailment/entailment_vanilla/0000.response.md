Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because it ensures that the differences are maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. It sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension.
5. It prints the result for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because:

* Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
* The list comprehension correctly calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
