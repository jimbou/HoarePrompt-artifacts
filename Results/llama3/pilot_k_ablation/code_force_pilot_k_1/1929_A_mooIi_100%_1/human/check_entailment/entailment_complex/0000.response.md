Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in each sorted list of integers.

The program uses a for loop to iterate over the range of the input integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, which represents the length of the array, and then reads n integers, which are stored in the list ar.

The list ar is then sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function. The program then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list using a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over the range from 1 to n (exclusive), and for each index i, it calculates the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1. The sum of these differences is then printed for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. It sorts the array in ascending order, which ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The program also correctly calculates the sum of these differences and prints the result for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
