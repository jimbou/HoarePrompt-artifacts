Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases from standard input and iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements themselves from standard input.

3. It sorts the array elements in ascending order using the `sorted` function and stores the sorted array in the variable `ar`.

4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive integers in the sorted array using a list comprehension and the `sum` function. This is the key step in solving the problem, as it effectively calculates the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

5. It prints the calculated sum for each test case.

6. After processing all test cases, the program leaves the standard input empty, which is the expected state.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the execution states provided as comments confirm that it behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
