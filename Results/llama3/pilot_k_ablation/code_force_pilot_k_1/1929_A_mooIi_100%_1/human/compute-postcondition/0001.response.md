The code reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from the input, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `ar`. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 0.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, ar is a sorted list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
