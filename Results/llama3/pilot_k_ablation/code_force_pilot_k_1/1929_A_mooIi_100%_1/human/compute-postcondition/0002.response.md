The code prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. The differences are calculated by subtracting each element from its previous element, starting from the second element (at index 1) up to the last element (at index `n-1`). The sum of these differences represents the total variation or dispersion of the elements in the list.

Output: **the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
