The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is a number greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be a number greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input is a number greater than 0, _ is 0**
