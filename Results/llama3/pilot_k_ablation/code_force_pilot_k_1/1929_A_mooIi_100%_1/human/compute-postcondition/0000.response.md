The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input from stdin is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the loop executes. So for the loop to be executed, the input from stdin must be an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) followed by t test cases, `_` is 0**
