Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string. Then, it creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The program correctly handles the case where the encoded string contains duplicate characters, as the `set` data structure is used to remove duplicates when constructing the auxiliary string `r`. The program also correctly handles the case where the encoded string contains characters that are not present in the original string, as the `char_map` dictionary will not contain these characters and the decoding process will ignore them.

Correctness: **True**
