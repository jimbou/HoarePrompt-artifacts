Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The provided function `func_1` attempts to reverse this encoding process. It first creates a string `r` of unique characters from the encoded string, sorted in alphabetical order. Then, it creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`). Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The key insight here is that the decoding process is essentially the inverse of the encoding process. By reversing the order of unique characters in the encoded string, the function effectively "un-encodes" the string, restoring the original string.

Based on this analysis, the function appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string, creates the necessary character mapping, and applies this mapping to decode the string.

Correctness: **True**
