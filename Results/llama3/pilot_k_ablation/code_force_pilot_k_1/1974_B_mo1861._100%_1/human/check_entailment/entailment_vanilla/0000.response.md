Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a string of distinct characters in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of each encoded string, and the encoded strings themselves.

2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string, sorts them in alphabetical order, and stores them in the string `r`.

4. The program then creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).

5. The program uses this character mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character with its symmetric character.

6. Finally, the program appends the decoded string to the `results` list and prints all the decoded strings after processing all test cases.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
