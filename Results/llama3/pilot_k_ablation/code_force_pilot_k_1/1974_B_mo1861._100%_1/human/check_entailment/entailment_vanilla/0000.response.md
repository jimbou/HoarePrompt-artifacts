Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t) and the encoded strings for each test case.

2. For each test case, the program extracts the length of the encoded string (n) and the encoded string itself (encoded).

3. The program defines a function func_1(encoded) that takes the encoded string as input and performs the decoding.

4. Inside func_1(encoded), the program first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order. This gives the auxiliary string r.

5. The program then creates a dictionary (char_map) that maps each character in r to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the characters in r and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding position from the end of r.

6. Finally, the program uses the char_map dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.

7. The decoded string is then appended to the results list.

8. After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings for each test case.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
