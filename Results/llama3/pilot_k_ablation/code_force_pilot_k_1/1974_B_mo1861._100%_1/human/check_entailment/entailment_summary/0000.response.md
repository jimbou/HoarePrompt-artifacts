Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes the encoded string as input, finds the unique characters in the string, sorts them in alphabetical order, and then creates a mapping of each character to its symmetric character in the sorted string. It then uses this mapping to decode the input string. The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
