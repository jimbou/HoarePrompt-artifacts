Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It first constructs a new auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the input string `s` in alphabetical order. Then, it replaces each character in the input string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`. The program uses a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the input string to its corresponding character in the sorted string of unique characters. The decoded string is then constructed by joining the mapped characters.

The execution summary also confirms that the program performs the expected character substitution without modifying the original input string.

Correctness: **True**
