Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It first finds the unique characters in the encoded string, sorts them in alphabetical order, and constructs the auxiliary string `r`. Then, it creates a character mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`). Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It correctly handles strings with duplicate characters, as the `set` data structure is used to find unique characters.
* It correctly handles strings with characters in any order, as the `sorted` function is used to sort the unique characters in alphabetical order.
* It correctly handles strings of any length, as the program uses a single pass through the encoded string to decode it.

The program also passes all the provided example test cases, and there are no obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
