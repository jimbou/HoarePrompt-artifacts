Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The `func_1` function takes the encoded string as input and first finds all unique characters in the string using `set(encoded)`. It then sorts these characters in alphabetical order using `sorted`.
2. The sorted unique characters are joined into a string `r`, which represents the auxiliary string described in the problem statement.
3. A character mapping `char_map` is created, where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).
4. The encoded string is then decoded by replacing each character with its symmetric character using the `char_map`.
5. The decoded string is returned as the result.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings with a single character
* Strings with multiple characters

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty, as it will simply return an empty string.

Overall, the program accurately implements the decoding algorithm and handles all possible cases correctly.
