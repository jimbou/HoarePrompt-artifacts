Output State: **encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from encoded in sorted order, r is a string of unique characters from encoded in sorted order, char_map is a dictionary mapping each unique character from encoded to its corresponding character in r, decoded is a string where each character from encoded is replaced by its corresponding character in r.**

In this output state, the initial state of `encoded` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `unique_chars` list contains the unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order. The `r` string is a concatenation of the unique characters in sorted order. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character from `encoded` to its corresponding character in `r`, effectively creating a mapping of characters to their replacements. Finally, the `decoded` string is the result of replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character in `r`, using the `char_map` dictionary.
