The code snippet provided is designed to reverse the order of unique characters in the string `encoded` and then use this reversed order to decode the string. Here's how it affects the state of variables:

1. `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))`: This line creates a set of unique characters from `encoded`, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns the result to `unique_chars`. Since `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` will be a list of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order.

2. `r = ''.join(unique_chars)`: This line joins the characters in `unique_chars` into a single string and assigns the result to `r`. Since `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order, `r` will be a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order.

3. `char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}`: This line creates a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`. Since `r` is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order, `char_map` will be a dictionary where each unique lowercase Latin letter is mapped to its reverse order counterpart.

4. `decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)`: This line uses the `char_map` dictionary to replace each character in `encoded` with its reverse order counterpart and joins the result into a single string. Since `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique lowercase Latin letter is mapped to its reverse order counterpart, `decoded` will be a string where the order of unique characters is reversed.

Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order, r is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order, char_map is a dictionary where each unique lowercase Latin letter is mapped to its reverse order counterpart, decoded is a string where the order of unique characters is reversed.**
