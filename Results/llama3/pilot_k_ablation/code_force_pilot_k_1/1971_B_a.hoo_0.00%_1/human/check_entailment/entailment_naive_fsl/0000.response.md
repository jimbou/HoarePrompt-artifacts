Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is "ab", the program will output "Yes" and "ab", but the problem statement requires the output to be a string that is not equal to the original string. In this case, the program fails to meet the requirement.

The issue lies in the line where the program prints the sorted string. The sorted string may not always be different from the original string, as seen in the case of "ab". A correct solution would need to ensure that the output string is always different from the original string.
