Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. The program checks if the string has more than one unique character by sorting the string and comparing it with the original string. If the sorted string is not equal to the original string, it means that the string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, and the program prints 'Yes' along with the sorted string. If the sorted string is equal to the original string, it means that the string cannot be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, and the program prints 'No'.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string has only one character, in which case it prints 'No' because a single character string cannot be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

Correctness: **True**
