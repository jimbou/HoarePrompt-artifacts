Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases (`cnt_test_cases`) and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads a string (`string`) and checks if the length of the string is 1. If it is, the program prints 'No' because a single character cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
3.  The program then checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing each character with the first character (`m`). If all characters are the same (`k == len(string)`), the program prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.
4.  If the string has at least two different characters, the program prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string. This is a valid solution because the sorted string is guaranteed to be different from the original string if it contains at least two different characters.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all input strings and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
