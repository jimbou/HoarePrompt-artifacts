Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case where the input string has only one character, in which case it prints 'No'. It also correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same, in which case it prints 'No'. For all other cases, it prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string, which is a valid rearrangement of the original string that is not equal to the original string.

The use of the `sorted` function to rearrange the string is a clever and efficient solution, as it guarantees that the resulting string will be different from the original string (unless all characters are the same, which is handled separately).

The program also correctly reads the input and handles the loop over the test cases.

Correctness: **True**
