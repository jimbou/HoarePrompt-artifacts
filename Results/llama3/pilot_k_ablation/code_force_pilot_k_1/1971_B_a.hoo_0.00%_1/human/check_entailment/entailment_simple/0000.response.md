Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case where the input string has only one character, in which case it is impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. It also correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same, in which case it is also impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

For all other cases, the program sorts the characters in the string and prints the sorted string. Since the sorted string is not equal to the original string (unless all characters are the same, which is handled separately), this is a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
