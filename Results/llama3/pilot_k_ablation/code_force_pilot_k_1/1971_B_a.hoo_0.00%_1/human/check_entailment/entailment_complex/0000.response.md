Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads a string and checks if it has more than one unique character. If the string has only one unique character, it prints 'No'. If the string has more than one unique character, it prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string.

The program correctly handles the case where the string has only one character, in which case it prints 'No'. It also correctly handles the case where the string has more than one character but all characters are the same, in which case it prints 'No'.

The program uses the built-in sorted function to sort the characters in the string, which is a correct and efficient way to do so.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
