Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the input string and checks if its length is 1. If so, it correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
3. The program then checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing each character to the first character. If all characters are the same, it correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.
4. If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, the program prints "Yes" and then prints the sorted string. This is correct because sorting the string will always result in a different string if the original string was not already sorted.
5. The program uses the `sorted` function to sort the string, which is a correct and efficient way to sort a string in Python.

Correctness: **True**
