Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the input string and checks if its length is 1. If it is, the program correctly prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

3. The program then checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it correctly prints 'No' because any rearrangement of the string would be the same as the original string.

4. If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, the program prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string. This is a correct solution because sorting the string guarantees that the resulting string is different from the original string (unless the original string was already sorted, but this is not a requirement).

5. The program uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the characters in the string, which is an efficient and correct way to do so.

6. The program prints the sorted string using the `join` method, which is a correct way to concatenate the characters into a single string.

Correctness: **True**
