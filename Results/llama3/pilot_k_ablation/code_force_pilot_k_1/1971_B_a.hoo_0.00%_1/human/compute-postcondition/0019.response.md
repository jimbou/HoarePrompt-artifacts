The code prints the characters in the string in sorted order. Since the string consists of lowercase English letters, the sorted order will be alphabetical. The length of the string is more than 1, so there will be at least two characters in the output. The value of k, which is the number of occurrences of the first character m in the string, is not equal to the length of the string, so there will be at least one character other than m in the output.

Output: **the characters in the string in sorted order (where string is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters)**
