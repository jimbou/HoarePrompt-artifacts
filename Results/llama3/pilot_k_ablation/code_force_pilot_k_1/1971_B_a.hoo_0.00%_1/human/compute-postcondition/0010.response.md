The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `i` is still 0 and the character at index `i` of `string` is still equal to `m`. The stdin still contains t-1 strings s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `string` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is 0, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**
