The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 0, so the new value of `k` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: cnt_test_cases is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of string, k is 1, and the current value of string[i] is equal to m.
