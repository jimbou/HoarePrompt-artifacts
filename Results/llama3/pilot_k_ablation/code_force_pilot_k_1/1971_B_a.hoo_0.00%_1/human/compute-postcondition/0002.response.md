Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `string` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_test_cases` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The variable `string` is assigned the value of the first string from the input, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The value of `i` is still 0 as it was not changed by the code. The stdin now contains t-1 strings s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, as one string has been read and assigned to the variable `string`.
