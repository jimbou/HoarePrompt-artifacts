In this output state, the value of `cnt_test_cases` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The variable `string` is assigned the value of the first string from the input, which consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. The stdin now contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, as one string has been consumed by the `input()` function.
