Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, determines if each string contains more than one unique character, and prints 'Yes' along with the sorted string if it does, or 'No' if it doesn't. The function processes a specified number of test cases, as indicated by an initial integer input, and prints the results for each case.**
