To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cnt_test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt_test_cases`. If `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t strings s of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is 0**
