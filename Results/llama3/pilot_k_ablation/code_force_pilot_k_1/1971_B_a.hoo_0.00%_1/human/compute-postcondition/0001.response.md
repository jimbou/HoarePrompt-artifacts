To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cnt_test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt_test_cases`. If `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, as it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10**
