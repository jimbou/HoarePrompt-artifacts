This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent integer (n) represents the number of times to print a sequence of numbers from 1 to n+1. The function then prints the sequence of numbers for each test case, with each number printed on a new line. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the output directly to the console.
