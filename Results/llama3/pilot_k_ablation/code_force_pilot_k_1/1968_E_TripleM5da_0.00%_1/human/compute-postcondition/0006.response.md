To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, since the range starts from 3. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3 for the loop to execute. The value of `i` before the loop starts is 0, but since the loop starts from 3, we need to adjust `i` to be 3.

The other states, such as `stdin` containing one input: a list of t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3), and the printed values 1, 2, do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 3**
