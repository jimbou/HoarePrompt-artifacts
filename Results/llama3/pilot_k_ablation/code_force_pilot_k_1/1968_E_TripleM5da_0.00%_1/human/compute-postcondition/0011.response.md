Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) specifies the number of subsequent integers to read. For each of these subsequent integers (n), the function prints a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and 2, followed by all numbers from 3 to n+1, with each number printed twice. The function continues this process until all t integers have been processed, at which point standard input is exhausted.**
