Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains one input: a list of t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), which is the first input from the stdin. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains a list of t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3), which is the remaining input.
