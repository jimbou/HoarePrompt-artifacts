Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), stdin contains one input: a list of n integers (2 <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin now contains a list of `n` integers, each between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).
