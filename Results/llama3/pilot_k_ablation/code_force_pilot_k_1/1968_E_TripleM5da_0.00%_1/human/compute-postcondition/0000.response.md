The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(). So we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the i is 0.
State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3), input() must be at least 1, i is 0**
