To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the `input()` function. For the loop to execute, `input()` must provide a value that can be converted to an integer, and this integer must be greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (t) (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers (n) (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 0, input() must provide a positive integer**
