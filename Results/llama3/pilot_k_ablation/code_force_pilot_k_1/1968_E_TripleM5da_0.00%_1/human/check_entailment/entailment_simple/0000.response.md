Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires the program to output n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program only prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for i from 3 to n + 1. This does not guarantee that the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

For example, when n = 3, the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), but the optimal arrangement is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) as shown in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
