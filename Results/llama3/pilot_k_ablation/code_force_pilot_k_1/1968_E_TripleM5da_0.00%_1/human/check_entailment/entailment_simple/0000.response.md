Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For each test case, it first prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then for each integer i from 3 to n + 1, it prints the coordinates (i, i).

However, the program has a logical error. The correct approach to solve this problem is to print the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n) for the first row, and then for each integer i from 2 to n, print the coordinates (i, 1), (i, 2), ..., (i, n - i + 1). This ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is distinct.

The given program does not follow this approach and instead prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for each integer i from 3 to n + 1. This results in duplicate Manhattan distances and does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.

Correctness: **False**
