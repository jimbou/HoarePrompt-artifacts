Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

However, the program has a logical error. It prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for every test case, regardless of the value of n. This is incorrect because the optimal arrangement of cells changes depending on the value of n.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), which is not the optimal arrangement. The optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem statement.

Similarly, for n = 4, the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4), which is not the optimal arrangement. The optimal arrangement for n = 4 is (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4), as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide the optimal arrangement of cells for all values of n.

Correctness: **False**
