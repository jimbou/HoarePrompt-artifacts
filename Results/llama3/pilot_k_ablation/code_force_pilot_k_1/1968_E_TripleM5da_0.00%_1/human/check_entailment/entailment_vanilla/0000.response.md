Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by printing the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program only prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for every test case, regardless of the value of n. This is incorrect because the optimal arrangement of cells depends on the value of n.

2. The program then prints the coordinates (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n + 2. This is also incorrect because it does not take into account the optimal arrangement of cells for each value of n.

3. The program does not handle the case where n is 2 correctly. For n = 2, the optimal arrangement is (1, 1) and (1, 2), but the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), which is incorrect.

4. The program does not handle the case where n is greater than 2 correctly. For n > 2, the optimal arrangement is not simply printing (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n + 2.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
