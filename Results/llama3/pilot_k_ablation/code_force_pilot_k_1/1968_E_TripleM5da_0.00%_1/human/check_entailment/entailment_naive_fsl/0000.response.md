Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly implementing the strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The correct strategy is to place the cells in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances, which is not achieved by the program's current implementation.

In the correct implementation, the cells should be placed in a way that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells are distinct. For example, for n = 3, the correct placement is (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which gives the set of Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}. The program's current implementation does not achieve this.
