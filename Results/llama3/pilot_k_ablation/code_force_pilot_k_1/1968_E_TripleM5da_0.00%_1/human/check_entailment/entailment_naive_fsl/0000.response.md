Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

As shown in the problem description, the correct arrangement for n = 3 is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1), (2,3) and (3,1).

The program does not correctly handle the case when n is odd. It always prints the first two points as (1,1) and (1,2), which is not correct for all cases.
