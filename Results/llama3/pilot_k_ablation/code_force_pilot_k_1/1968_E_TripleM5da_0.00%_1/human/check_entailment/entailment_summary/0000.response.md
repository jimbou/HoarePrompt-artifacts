Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid (n). It then prints a sequence of points that are supposed to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, the program has a logical error. It always prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the points (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n+1. This is not a correct solution to the problem.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the correct solution for n = 3 is to print the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
