Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the required functionality. It iterates through the array `a` and keeps track of the last index `j` where the value was different from the current value `p`. This is done by updating `j` to the current index `i` whenever the value changes. The result is stored in the list `a`, where `a[i]` represents the last index before `i` where the value was different.

When processing queries, the program checks if the value at index `a[r]` is less than `l`. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints the indices `a[r]` and `r`, which represent a pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When there are no pairs of different elements in the range `[l, r]`.
* When there are multiple pairs of different elements in the range `[l, r]`.
* When the range `[l, r]` contains only one element.
* When the range `[l, r]` contains multiple elements with the same value.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
