Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries. For each query, it finds the first pair of different elements within the given range and prints their indices. If no such pair exists, it prints -1 -1.

The program uses a clever approach to find the first pair of different elements. It maintains an array `a` where `a[i]` is the index of the first element that is different from the element at index `i`. This is done by iterating through the array and updating `a[i]` whenever a different element is found.

The program then uses this array to answer the queries. For each query, it checks if the index `a[r]` is within the range `[l, r]`. If it is, it prints the indices `a[r]` and `r`. If not, it prints -1 -1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles edge cases such as when the range `[l, r]` contains only one element, or when the array contains only one distinct element. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
