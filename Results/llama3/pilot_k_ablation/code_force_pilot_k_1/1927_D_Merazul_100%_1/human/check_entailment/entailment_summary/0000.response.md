Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find a pair of different elements within the given range for each query. The program uses a clever approach to keep track of the last index where the value is different from the current value, which allows it to efficiently find a pair of different elements for each query.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and the queries. For each query, it checks if the value at the right boundary of the query is greater than or equal to the left boundary. If it is, it prints the value at the right boundary and the right boundary itself. Otherwise, it prints -1 twice.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and queries correctly and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
