Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of test cases, the length of the array, the array elements, the number of queries, and the query boundaries.
2.  It initializes an array `a` with a leading 0, which is used to store the indices of the last occurrence of a different element. The variables `p`, `i`, and `j` are used to keep track of the current element, the current index, and the index of the last different element, respectively.
3.  The program then iterates through the array elements, updating the `j` index whenever it encounters a different element. This effectively creates a list of indices where a different element is found.
4.  For each query, the program checks if the value at the corresponding index in list `a` is less than the left boundary of the query. If it is, it prints -1 -1, indicating that no pair of different elements exists within the query range. Otherwise, it prints the value at the corresponding index in list `a` along with the right boundary of the query, which represents the indices of a pair of different elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to find pairs of different elements within the specified query ranges.

Correctness: **True**
