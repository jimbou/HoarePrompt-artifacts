Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in an array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j`. The program uses a clever approach to preprocess the array and store the indices of the first occurrence of a different element to the right of each index.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `a` itself, and the number of queries `q`. It then preprocesses the array by iterating over it and storing the indices of the first occurrence of a different element to the right of each index in the list `a`.

The program then iterates over each query and checks if the index stored in `a[r]` is not less than `l`. If it is not, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`. Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by preprocessing the array and storing the indices of the first occurrence of a different element to the right of each index. The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
