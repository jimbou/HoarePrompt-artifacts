Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in an array `a` such that `a_i != a_j` for each query with boundaries `l` and `r`. The program uses a clever approach to preprocess the array and store the indices of the last occurrence of a different element.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes an array `a` with a dummy value `0` at index `0`, and variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to keep track of the last occurrence of a different element.
4. It iterates over the array `a` and for each element `x`, it updates the index `j` to be the current index `i` if `x` is different from the previous element `p`. It also updates the array `a` at index `i+1` with the value of `j`.
5. It reads the number of queries `q` and iterates over each query.
6. For each query, it reads the boundaries `l` and `r` and checks if the value of `a` at index `r` is less than `l`. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints the value of `a` at index `r` and `r` itself.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by preprocessing the array and storing the indices of the last occurrence of a different element. This allows it to answer each query in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
