The only variable in the loop head is variable x and R(). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the R(). If R() has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs remaining, a is a list containing a single element 0, p is 0, i is 0, j is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to R() is not empty and x is the first element in R().
State: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs remaining, a is a list containing a single element 0, p is 0, i is 0, j is 0, R() is not empty, x is the first element in R()**
