Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a list of 0s and 1s, `p` is the second last element in R(), `i` is equal to the number of elements in R() minus 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the third last element in R(), `q` is the last element in R(), stdin contains no more test cases**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to the second last element in R(), and the value of `i` has been decremented by 1. The value of `j` is now dependent on whether the last element in R() is equal to the third last element in R(). The variable `q` has been assigned the value of the last element in R(). The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
