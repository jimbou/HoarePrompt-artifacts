Output State: **t is 1 less than its original value and t currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains an integer n, an array a of n integers, an integer q, and q queries, each query contains two integers l and r, a is a list of length equal to the number of elements in R() plus 1, p is the last element in R(), i is equal to the number of elements in R(), j is either 0 or i depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), q is the first element in the first test case in stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains the same, but the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1. The first test case in stdin has been read, and its value has been assigned to q. The other variables remain unchanged.
