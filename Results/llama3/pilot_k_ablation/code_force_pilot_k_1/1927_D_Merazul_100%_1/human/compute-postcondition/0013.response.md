Functionality: **This function reads a number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, an array a of n integers, an integer q, and q queries, each containing two integers l and r. For each query, it prints the value of a at index r and r if a[r] is greater than or equal to l, otherwise it prints -1 twice. The function processes all test cases and queries, and upon completion, the standard input is exhausted, and all queries have been processed and printed accordingly.**
