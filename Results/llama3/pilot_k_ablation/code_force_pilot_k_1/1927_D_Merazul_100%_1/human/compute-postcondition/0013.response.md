Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of integers, another integer, and multiple pairs of integers. It then processes each test case by creating a list 'a' of 0s and 1s based on the input list, and for each pair of integers, it prints either the value at the corresponding index in list 'a' along with the index, or [-1, -1] if the value at that index is less than the first integer in the pair. This process is repeated for the number of test cases specified at the beginning.**
