Output State: **t is 0, a is a list of 0s and 1s, p is the second last element in R(), i is equal to the number of elements in R() minus 1, j is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the third last element in R(), q is 0, l is the first element in R(), r is the second element in R()**

In this output state, the value of `q` has been decremented by 1, making it 0. The values of `l` and `r` have been assigned the first and second elements of `R()`, respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains no more test cases.
