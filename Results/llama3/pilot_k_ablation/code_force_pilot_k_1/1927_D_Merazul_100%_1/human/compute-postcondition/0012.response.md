Output State: **t is 0, a is a list of 0s and 1s, p is the second last element in R(), i is equal to the number of elements in R() minus 1, j is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the third last element in R(), q is 0, and the following has been printed for each iteration of the loop: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, or [-1, -1] if a[r] is less than l, and this process has been repeated for the number of test cases equal to the initial value of t**
