Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains an integer n, an array a of n integers, an integer q, and q queries, each query contains two integers l and r, t is 1 less than its original value.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function R that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. Then, it reads the first line from stdin, which contains the number of test cases t, and assigns it to the variable t. Since t is assigned a value, it is no longer considered as part of the stdin input. The value of t is reduced by 1, as one test case has been processed. The rest of the input remains unchanged, with t-1 test cases remaining in stdin.
