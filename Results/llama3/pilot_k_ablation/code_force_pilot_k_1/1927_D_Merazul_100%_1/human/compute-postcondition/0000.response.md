Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs remaining: a list of integers, an integer, and multiple pairs of integers. t is an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. The second line reads the first integer from stdin using the `R` function and assigns it to the variable `t`. This consumes the first input from each test case, leaving the remaining inputs in stdin. The value of `t` is now an integer, representing the length of the list in each test case.
