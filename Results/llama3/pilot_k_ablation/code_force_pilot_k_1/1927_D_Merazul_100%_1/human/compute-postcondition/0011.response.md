Output State: **t is 1 less than its original value and t is greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains an integer n, an array a of n integers, an integer q that must be 0, and 0 queries, a is a list of length equal to the number of elements in R() plus 1, p is the last element in R(), i is equal to the number of elements in R(), j is either 0 or i depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), q is 0, l is the first element in R(), r is the second element in R(), and for each query in the original q queries, if the value of a at index r is less than l, then -1 is printed twice, otherwise the value of a at index r and r are printed**
