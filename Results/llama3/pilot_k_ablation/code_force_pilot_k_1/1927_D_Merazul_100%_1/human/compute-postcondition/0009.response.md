To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of 0s and 1s.
   - `p` is the second last element in `R()`.
   - `i` is equal to the number of elements in `R()` minus 1.
   - `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last element in `R()` is equal to the third last element in `R()`.
   - `q` is 0.
   - `l` is the first element in `R()`.
   - `r` is the second element in `R()`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The print statement uses a conditional expression to decide what to print. The condition is `a[r] < l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it prints `a[r]` and `r`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, it prints `[-1] * 2`, which is a list containing two -1s.

Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact values of `a[r]` and `l` without knowing the contents of `R()` and the list `a`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

- If the element at index `r` in list `a` is less than the first element in `R()`, the output will be the value of `a[r]` and the value of `r`.
- If the element at index `r` in list `a` is not less than the first element in `R()`, the output will be two -1s.

Output: **Either (a[r], r) where a[r] is the element at index r in list a and r is the second element in R(), or [-1, -1]**
