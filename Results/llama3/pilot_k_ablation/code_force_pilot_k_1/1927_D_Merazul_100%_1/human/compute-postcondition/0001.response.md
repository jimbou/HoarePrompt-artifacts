The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, t is 1 less than its original value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the original value of t needed to have been equal or greater than 1 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains an integer n, an array a of n integers, an integer q, and q queries, each query contains two integers l and r, t is 1 less than its original value and t currently must be greater than 0**
