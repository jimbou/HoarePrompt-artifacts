Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the input strings, and checks for the condition where there are two adjacent '<' characters in the strings. If such a condition is found, it prints 'NO', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). If no such condition is found after checking all pairs of adjacent characters, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The program's logic is correct because if there are two adjacent '<' characters in the strings, it means that the robot will be stuck in an infinite loop and cannot reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if no such condition is found, it means that the robot can move to the right and eventually reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
