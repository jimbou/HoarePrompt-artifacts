Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print "NO", but the correct answer is "YES". The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if there are any pairs of '<' arrows in the same column or adjacent columns, but it does not consider the case where the robot can move down and then right to reach the target cell.
