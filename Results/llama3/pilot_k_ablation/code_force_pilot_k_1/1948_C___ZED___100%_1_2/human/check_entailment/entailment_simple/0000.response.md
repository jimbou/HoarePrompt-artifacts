Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of adjacent cells in the grid where both arrows point to the left. If such a pair is found, it prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The robot can reach the cell (2, n) if and only if there is no pair of adjacent cells in the grid where both arrows point to the left. This is because the robot can move left, right, down, or up, and then it must move along the arrow in the current cell. If there is a pair of adjacent cells with both arrows pointing to the left, the robot will be stuck in an infinite loop and cannot reach the cell (2, n).

The program also correctly handles the case where n is even, as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
