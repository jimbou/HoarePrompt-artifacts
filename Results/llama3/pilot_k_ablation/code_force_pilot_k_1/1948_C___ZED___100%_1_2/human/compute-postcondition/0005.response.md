Output: **`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` equals '<' or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` equals '<', and 'NO' is printed**
