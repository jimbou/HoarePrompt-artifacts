Output State: **`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the condition `i + 1 < n` still holds. The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is also still valid. Additionally, 'NO' has been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
