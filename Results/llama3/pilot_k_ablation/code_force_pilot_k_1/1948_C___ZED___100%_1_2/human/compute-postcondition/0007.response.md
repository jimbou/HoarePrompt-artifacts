Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 1. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
