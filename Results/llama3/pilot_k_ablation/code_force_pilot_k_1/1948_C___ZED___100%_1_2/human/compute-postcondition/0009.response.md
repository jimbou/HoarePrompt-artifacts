Output State: **`j` is `t`, `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is either `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n-2` if `n` is even, and either 'NO' or 'YES' has been printed for each test case. If 'NO' has been printed for a test case, then there exists an `i` in the range 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) such that `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If 'YES' has been printed for a test case, then no such `i` exists.**
