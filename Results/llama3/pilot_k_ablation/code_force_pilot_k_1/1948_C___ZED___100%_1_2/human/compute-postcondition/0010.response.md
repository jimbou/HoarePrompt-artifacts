Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by two strings of length n containing '<' and/or '>'. It then checks each test case to determine if there exists a pair of adjacent characters in the strings that are both '<'. If such a pair is found, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints a result for each one, leaving the input stream empty and the variables n, a, and b with their final values from the last test case.**
