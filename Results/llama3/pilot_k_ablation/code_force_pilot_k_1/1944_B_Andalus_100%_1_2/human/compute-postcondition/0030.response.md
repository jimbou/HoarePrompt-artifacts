To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 1 single element, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we know that `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements of `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements of `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements of `rgt`, `i` is n-1, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * the number of duplicate elements in `lft`, and `elem` is the last element in the list `ldb` that was printed.

However, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to have at least 1 single element. We also need to adjust the state of `elem` to be the first single element in the list `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements of `lft`, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 single element of `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements of `rgt`, `i` is n-1, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * the number of duplicate elements in `lft`, and `elem` is the first single element in the list `sng`**
