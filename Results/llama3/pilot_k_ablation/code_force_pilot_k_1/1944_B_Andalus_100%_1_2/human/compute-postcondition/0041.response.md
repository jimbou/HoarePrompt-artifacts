The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt, i is n-1, sz is 0, and elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt that must have at least 1 element, i is n-1, sz is 0, and elem is the first element in the list rdb**
