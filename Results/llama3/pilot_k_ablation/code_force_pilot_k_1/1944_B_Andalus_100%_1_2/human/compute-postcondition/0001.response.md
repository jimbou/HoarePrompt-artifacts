To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `T`. The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4, _ is 0**
