Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt that may or may not be empty, i is n-1, and elem is the last element in the list rdb that was printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2 * the number of duplicate elements in rdb, then all duplicate elements in rdb are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, if 2 * k - sz is less than 2 * the number of duplicate elements in rdb, then the first 2 * k / 2 duplicate elements in rdb are printed twice with a space in between. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, sz is less than 2 * k. If rdb is empty, then the loop does not execute and sz remains 0.**
