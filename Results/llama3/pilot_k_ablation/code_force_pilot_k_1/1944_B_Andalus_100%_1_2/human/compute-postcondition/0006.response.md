The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to be 1, since the loop starts from 1.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, i is 1. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, sng is a list containing one element which is the smallest element of lft. Otherwise, sng remains an empty list.**
