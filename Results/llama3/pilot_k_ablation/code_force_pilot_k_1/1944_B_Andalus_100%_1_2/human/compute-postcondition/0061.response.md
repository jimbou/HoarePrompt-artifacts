Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, separating them into two lists (left and right), and further categorizes them into three lists: left doubles, right doubles, and singles. It then prints out a sequence of integers, where it prioritizes printing doubles from the left and right lists, and fills in any remaining spots with singles. The function repeats this process for each test case, and after processing all test cases, it leaves the input stream empty.**
