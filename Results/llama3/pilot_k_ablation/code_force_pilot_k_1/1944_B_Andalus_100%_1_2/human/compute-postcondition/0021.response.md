The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ldb. If ldb has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft. So for the loop to be executed  the list ldb must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
