Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the same multiple test cases, each with two lines of input, but the first input (the number of test cases) has been consumed.
