Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft that must have at least 1 single element, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt that may or may not be empty, i is n-1, elem is the first single element in the list sng, and sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
