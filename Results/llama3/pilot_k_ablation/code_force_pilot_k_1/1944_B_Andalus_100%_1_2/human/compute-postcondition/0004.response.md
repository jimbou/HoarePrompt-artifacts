Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, the first two elements of lft are not equal, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one element which is the smallest element of lft.**

In this output state, the code has appended the smallest element of the sorted list `lft` to the list `sng`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1. The lists `lft`, `rgt`, `lst`, `ldb`, and `rdb` retain their initial characteristics, with `sng` now containing the smallest element of `lft`.
