Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft that must have at least 1 single element, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt that may or may not be empty, i is n-1, and elem is the first single element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
