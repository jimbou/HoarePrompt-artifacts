Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` of `lft`. The first two elements of `lft` are equal. The current value of `i` is either equal to `n-1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `sng` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lft`, which is a sorted list of `n` integers. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `i` and the first two elements of `lft` are still valid.
