Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and is greater than 1, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, and i is 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing the duplicate element rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb remains an empty list.***
