Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements of `lft`, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 single element of `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements of `rgt`, `i` is n-1, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * the number of duplicate elements in `lft`, and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, `elem` is the first single element in the list `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
