Output: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt, i is n-1, sz is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * the number of duplicate elements in lft plus the number of single elements in lft that were printed, and elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed. If 2 * k is greater than or equal to 2 * the number of duplicate elements in lft, then all duplicate elements in lft are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, if 2 * k is less than 2 * the number of duplicate elements in lft, then the first 2 * k / 2 duplicate elements in lft are printed twice with a space in between. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all single elements in sng are printed followed by a space. A new line is printed.**
