Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing at least 1 duplicate element of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt, i is n-1, sz is 2, and elem is the first element in the list ldb. The current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values except for sz, which is now 2. The value of sz has increased by 2. The current value of (2 * k - sz) is now greater than or equal to 0. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
