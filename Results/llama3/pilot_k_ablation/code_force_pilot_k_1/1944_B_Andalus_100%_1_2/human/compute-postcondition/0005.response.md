Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, sng is a list containing one element which is the smallest element of lft. Otherwise, sng remains an empty list.***
