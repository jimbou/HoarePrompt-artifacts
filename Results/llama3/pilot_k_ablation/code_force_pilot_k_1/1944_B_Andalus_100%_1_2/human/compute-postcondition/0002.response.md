Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list**

The code executes multiple lines that affect the state of several variables. The first line reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `n` and `k`. The second line reads 2n integers from stdin, assigning them to `lst`. The third and fourth lines split `lst` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, each containing n integers. The fifth and sixth lines sort `lft` and `rgt` in ascending order. The last three lines initialize three empty lists, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`. The value of `T` remains unchanged, and stdin contains one less test case. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, and the lists `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are created or modified accordingly.
