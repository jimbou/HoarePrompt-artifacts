Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and is greater than 1, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing the duplicate element rgt[i] which is equal to rgt[i - 1], and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of rgt[i] has been appended to the list rdb, which now contains at least one duplicate element from the list rgt. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
