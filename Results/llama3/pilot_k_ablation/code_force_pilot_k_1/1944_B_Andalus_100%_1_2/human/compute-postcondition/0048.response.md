Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing all the single elements of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt that must have at least 1 element, i is n-1, and elem is the first element in the list rdb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 2, and the current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of the list rdb which is elem has been printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 2 * k - sz is less than 2.***
