Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of lft, sng is a list containing at least 1 single element of lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements of rgt, i is n-1, sz is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * the number of duplicate elements in lft plus 1. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and an element is printed followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of sz being greater than or equal to 2 * k.
