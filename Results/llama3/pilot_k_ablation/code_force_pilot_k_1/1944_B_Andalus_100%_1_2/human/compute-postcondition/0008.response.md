Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of n integers, ldb is a list containing one element which is the second smallest element of lft, rdb is an empty list, i is 1. The first two elements of lft are equal, and the current value of lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1]. If the first two elements of lft were not equal before, sng is a list containing one element which is the smallest element of lft. Otherwise, sng remains an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to contain the second smallest element of lft, which is the current value of lft[i]. The other variables remain unchanged.
