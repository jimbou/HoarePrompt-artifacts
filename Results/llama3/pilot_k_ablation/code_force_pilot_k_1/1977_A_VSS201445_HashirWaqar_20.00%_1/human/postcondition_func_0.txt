This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and m. For each test case, it checks if n is less than m and prints 'NO' if true. If n is not less than m, it checks if both n and m are either both odd or both even, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met. If neither condition is met, it takes no action. The function does not store the values of n and m after processing each test case. The function will only execute if the input is in the correct format, consisting of an integer t followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m.
