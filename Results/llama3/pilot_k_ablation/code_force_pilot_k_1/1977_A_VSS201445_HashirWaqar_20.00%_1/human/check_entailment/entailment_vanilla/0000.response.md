Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves.

- If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks the parity of n and m. If both n and m are odd or both are even, it prints 'YES'. This is because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs (i.e., add one cube and then remove one cube) to reach the desired number of cubes.

This logic is correct because:

- If n is less than m, it's impossible to have m cubes after n moves.

- If n is greater than or equal to m, Nikita can always add or remove cubes in pairs to reach the desired number of cubes, as long as the parity of n and m is the same.

Therefore, the given program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
