Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

- If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks the parity of n and m. If both n and m are odd or both are even, it prints 'YES'. This is because Nikita can always add or remove cubes to match the parity of m.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly handles the case where n is less than m and the case where n is greater than or equal to m. The use of bitwise operators (&) to check the parity of n and m is also correct.

However, the program does not handle the case where n is greater than or equal to m and n and m have different parity. In this case, Nikita cannot build a tower with exactly m cubes, because he cannot add or remove an odd number of cubes to match the parity of m.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
