Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. It first checks if n is less than m, in which case it's impossible to build the tower, so it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if both n and m are odd or both are even. If they are, it prints 'YES', because Nikita can put or remove cubes in pairs, ending up with m cubes. If n and m have different parities, it doesn't print anything, which is correct because in this case, it's impossible to build the tower.

Correctness: **True**
