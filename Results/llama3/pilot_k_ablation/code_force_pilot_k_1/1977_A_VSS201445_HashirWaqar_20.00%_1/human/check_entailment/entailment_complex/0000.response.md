Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` is less than `m`. If true, it prints 'NO', which is correct because Nikita cannot obtain a tower with `m` cubes if he only has `n` moves and `n` is less than `m`.
3. If `n` is not less than `m`, the program checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for Nikita to obtain a tower with `m` cubes. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', which is correct.
4. If neither of the above conditions is met, the program takes no action, which is also correct because Nikita cannot obtain a tower with `m` cubes in this case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
