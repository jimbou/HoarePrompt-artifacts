Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. Therefore, after n moves, the resulting tower can have exactly m cubes if and only if n is greater than or equal to m and both n and m are either both odd or both even.

The program correctly checks these conditions:

1.  It checks if n is less than m and prints 'NO' if true, because in this case, it's impossible to have m cubes after n moves.
2.  If n is not less than m, it checks if both n and m are either both odd or both even using the bitwise AND operator (&) and the modulo operator (%). If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
