Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower after n moves must be even if n is even, and odd if n is odd. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move.

The program checks this condition using the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if both n and m are odd (n & 1 and m & 1) or both are even (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0). If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program also correctly handles the case where n is less than m, in which case it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes, and prints "NO".

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
