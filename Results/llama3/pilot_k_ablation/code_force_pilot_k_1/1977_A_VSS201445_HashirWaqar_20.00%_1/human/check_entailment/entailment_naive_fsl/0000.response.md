Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks if n is less than m, in which case it is not possible to have a tower with m cubes, and prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if both n and m are odd or both are even, in which case it is possible to have a tower with m cubes, and prints 'YES'. This logic is correct because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes in the tower must change by 1 in each move. Therefore, if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves.
