Output State: **The loop has executed for a number of times equal to the integer t. For each iteration, if n is less than m, 'NO' is printed. If n is not less than m, and both n and m are either both odd or both even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken. The values of n and m are not stored after the loop finishes. The loop will not execute if the input does not contain an integer t followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m.**
