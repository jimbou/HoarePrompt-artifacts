The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` accepts an input and splits it into two integers, which are assigned to `n` and `m`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). Since the first input is an integer t, it is consumed by the input() function and split into two integers, which are assigned to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` is not used in the assignment, so it is not affected. The value of `_` is also not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 100), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), t is greater than 0**
