To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is an integer `t` in the input that is greater than 0. 

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 0, t is greater than 0**
