Postcondition: ***A ValueError is raised because the input contains only one integer t, but the code is trying to assign two integer values to `n` and `m`. Additionally, `n` is not less than `m`. If both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
