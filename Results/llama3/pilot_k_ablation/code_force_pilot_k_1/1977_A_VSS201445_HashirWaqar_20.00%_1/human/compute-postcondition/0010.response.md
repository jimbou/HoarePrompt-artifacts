Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), t is greater than 0. If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not less than `m`, then if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, 'YES' is printed.**
