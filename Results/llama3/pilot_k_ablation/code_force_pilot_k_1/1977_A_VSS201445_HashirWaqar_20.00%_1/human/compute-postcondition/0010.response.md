Postcondition: **A ValueError is raised because the input contains only one integer t, but the code is trying to assign two integer values to `n` and `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not less than `m`, and both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
