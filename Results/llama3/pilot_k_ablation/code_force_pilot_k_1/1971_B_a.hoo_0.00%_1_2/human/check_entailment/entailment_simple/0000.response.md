Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case where the input string has a length of 1, in which case it is impossible to rearrange the characters to form a different string. It also correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same, in which case it is also impossible to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

For all other cases, the program sorts the characters in the string and prints the sorted string. Since the sorted string is guaranteed to be different from the original string (unless all characters are the same, which is handled separately), this is a correct solution.

The program also correctly handles the output format, printing "YES" followed by the rearranged string, or "NO" if it is impossible to rearrange the string.

Correctness: **True**
