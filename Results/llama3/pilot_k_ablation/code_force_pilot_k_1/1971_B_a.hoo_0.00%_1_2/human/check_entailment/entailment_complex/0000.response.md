Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the length of the string is 1. If it is, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
3. If the length of the string is more than 1, it checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing the first character `m` with all other characters. If all characters are the same, it prints 'No'.
4. If not all characters are the same, it prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string. This is a correct solution because sorting the string will always result in a different string if the original string is not already sorted.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including strings with a single character, strings with all characters the same, and strings with different characters. The output matches the expected output in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
