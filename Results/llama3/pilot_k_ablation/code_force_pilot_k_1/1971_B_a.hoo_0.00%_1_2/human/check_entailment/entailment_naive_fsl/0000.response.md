Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. Here's why:

1.  If the input string has only one character, the program correctly outputs "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
2.  If the input string has all identical characters, the program correctly outputs "No" because any rearrangement of the string would result in the same string.
3.  For all other cases, the program correctly outputs "Yes" and prints a rearranged version of the input string by sorting the characters. This ensures that the output string is different from the input string, meeting the problem's requirements.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
