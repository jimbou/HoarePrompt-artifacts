Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by checking if all characters in the input string are the same. If they are, it prints 'No', indicating that it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. If the characters are not all the same, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted string, which is a valid rearrangement of the original string.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string has only one character, in which case it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example inputs and outputs provided in the problem description match the program's expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
