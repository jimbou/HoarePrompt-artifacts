In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is between 1 and 1000. We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10. The variable `i` is still 0. The standard input contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10. The variable `m` is still the first character of the string. The variable `k` has been incremented by 1 and is now 1. The current value of `i` is still 0 and the character at index `i` in the string is still equal to `m`.
