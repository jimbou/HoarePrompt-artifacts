Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains cnt_test_cases strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `cnt_test_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that the first input is an integer `t` between 1 and 1000, the value of `cnt_test_cases` will be an integer between 1 and 1000. The remaining inputs in the standard input are `cnt_test_cases` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10, as specified in the initial state.
