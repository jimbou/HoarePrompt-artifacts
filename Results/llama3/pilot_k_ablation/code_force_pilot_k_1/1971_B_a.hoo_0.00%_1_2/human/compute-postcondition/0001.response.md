According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt_test_cases`. If `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10. So for the loop to be executed `cnt_test_cases` must be at least 1 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10, `i` is 0**
