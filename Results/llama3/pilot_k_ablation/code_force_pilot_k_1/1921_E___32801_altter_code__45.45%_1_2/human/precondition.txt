stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six space-separated integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board. x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9. Either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
