Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column, but Alice is not directly above or below Bob. In this case, the program will incorrectly print "Draw" instead of "Alice" or "Bob".

For example, if the input is:

10 10 5 5 8 5

The program will print "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move down and capture Bob's chip.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if Alice and Bob are in the same column and if Alice is directly above or below Bob. It does not consider the case where Alice and Bob are in the same column, but Alice is not directly above or below Bob.
