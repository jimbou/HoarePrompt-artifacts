Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the positions of the two chips. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If the chips are in the same row (x2 <= x1), it prints "draw".
2. If the difference between the x-coordinates is odd and the y-coordinates are different, it prints "Alice".
3. If the difference between the x-coordinates is even and the y-coordinates are different, it prints "Bob".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
