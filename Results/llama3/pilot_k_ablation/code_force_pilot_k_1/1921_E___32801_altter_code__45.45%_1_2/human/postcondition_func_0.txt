Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two chips on a board. The function takes six integers as input: the dimensions of the board (h and w) and the initial positions of two chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b). It then prints 'draw' if the chips are in the same row, 'Alice' if the difference between the x-coordinates is odd and the y-coordinates are different, or 'Bob' if the difference between the x-coordinates is even and the y-coordinates are different. The function does not return any value.
