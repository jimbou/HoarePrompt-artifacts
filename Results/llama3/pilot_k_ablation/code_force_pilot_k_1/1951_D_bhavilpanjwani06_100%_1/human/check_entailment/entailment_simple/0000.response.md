Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' as it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. If `n` is larger than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. In all other cases, it prints 'NO' as it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
