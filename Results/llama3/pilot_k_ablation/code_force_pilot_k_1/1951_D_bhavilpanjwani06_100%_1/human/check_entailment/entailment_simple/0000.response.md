Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases:

1. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

2. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1. This way, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, which allows Alice to buy one jewel and be left with `k - 1` coins. The second stall has a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

   If `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to set up the stalls in a way that allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
