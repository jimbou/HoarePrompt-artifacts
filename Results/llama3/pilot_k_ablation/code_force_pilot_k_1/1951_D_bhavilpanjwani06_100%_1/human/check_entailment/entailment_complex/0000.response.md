Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her available coins. The program handles all possible cases:

1.  If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
2.  If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1, indicating that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins.
3.  If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by 2, `n-k+1`, and 1, indicating that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins by setting up two stalls with prices `n-k+1` and 1. If false, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins.

The program correctly processes multiple test cases from standard input and provides the expected output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
