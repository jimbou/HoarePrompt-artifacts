Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each case. The program first checks if Alice has enough coins to buy the desired number of jewels. If she does not, it prints 'NO'. If she does, it checks if the number of coins she has is equal to the number of jewels she wants to buy. If it is, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice, indicating that she can buy the jewels with one purchase. If the number of coins is not equal to the number of jewels, it checks if the number of jewels minus 1 is less than the number of coins minus the number of jewels plus 1. If it is, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the difference between the number of coins and the number of jewels plus 1, indicating that she can buy the jewels with two purchases. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
