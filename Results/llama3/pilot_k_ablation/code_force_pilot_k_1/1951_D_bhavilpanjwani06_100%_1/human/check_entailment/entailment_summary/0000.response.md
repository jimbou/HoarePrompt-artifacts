Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`. 

1. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

2. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1. This is because Alice can buy `k` jewels with `k` coins, and the price for each jewel can be 1.

3. If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by 2, `n-k+1`, and 1. This is because Alice can buy `k-1` jewels with `n-k+1` coins at the first stall, and then buy 1 jewel with 1 coin at the second stall.

4. If `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO'. This is because in this case, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
