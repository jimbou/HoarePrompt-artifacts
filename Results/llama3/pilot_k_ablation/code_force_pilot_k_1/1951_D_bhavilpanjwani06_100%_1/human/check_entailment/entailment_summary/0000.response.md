Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Alice can buy exactly k jewels with her n coins and prints the result along with the number of purchases and the amount spent on each purchase, if possible.

The program first checks if Alice has less coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, in which case it prints 'NO'. If she has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy, it prints 'YES' and indicates that she can buy all the jewels at a price of 1 coin each.

If Alice has more coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, the program checks if the number of jewels she wants to buy minus 1 is less than the number of coins she has minus the number of jewels she wants to buy plus 1. If this condition is true, it means that Alice can buy the jewels in two purchases: the first purchase will be for n - k + 1 coins, and the second purchase will be for 1 coin. In this case, the program prints 'YES' and indicates the number of purchases and the amount spent on each purchase.

If none of the above conditions are true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with her n coins.

Correctness: **True**
