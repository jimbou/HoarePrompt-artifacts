Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 255 and k = 8, the program prints 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' with the pricing 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1.

The issue with the program is that it does not consider all possible cases. It only checks if n < k, n == k, or k - 1 < n - k + 1, but it does not consider other cases where it is possible to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

For instance, in the case where n = 255 and k = 8, the program does not consider the possibility of setting up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, which would make Alice buy exactly 8 jewels.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
