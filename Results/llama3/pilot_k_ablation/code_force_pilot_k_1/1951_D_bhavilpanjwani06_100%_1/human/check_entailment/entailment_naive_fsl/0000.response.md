Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 255 and k = 8, the program prints "NO", but the correct answer is "YES" with the prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

The issue with the program is that it only considers three cases: n < k, n == k, and k - 1 < n - k + 1. However, there are other cases where Bob can erect at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. For example, in the case where n = 255 and k = 8, Bob can erect 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases.
