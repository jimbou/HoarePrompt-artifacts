The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` accepts two positive integers from the input, where `input().split()` splits the input into two parts and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.

The value of `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, and the value of `k` is assigned the second integer from the input. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since the first line of the input is consumed, the stdin now contains t-1 lines of input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains t-1 lines of input.**
