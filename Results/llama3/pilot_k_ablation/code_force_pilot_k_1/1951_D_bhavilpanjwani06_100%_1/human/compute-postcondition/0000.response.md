Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of two positive integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but since one test case has been processed, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
