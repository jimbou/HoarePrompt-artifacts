Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `k` minus 1 is less than the current value of `n` minus `k` plus 1, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 which is [n - k + 1] and the number 1**
