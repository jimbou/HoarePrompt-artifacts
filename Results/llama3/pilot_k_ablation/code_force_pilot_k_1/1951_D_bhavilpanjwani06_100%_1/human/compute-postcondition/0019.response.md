Output: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, `n` is not less than `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `k-1` is less than the current value of `n-k+1`, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: n - k + 1 and 1**
