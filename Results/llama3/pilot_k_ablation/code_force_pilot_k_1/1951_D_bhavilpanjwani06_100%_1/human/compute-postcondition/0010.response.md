Based on the initial state, the code `print(1)` will print the number 1.

The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is larger than or equal to `k`. However, these variables are not used in the print statement. The print statement simply prints the number 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
