Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed twice. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
