Functionality: **This function determines whether Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her available coins. It takes two positive integers `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy) as input. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1. If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by 2, `n-k+1`, and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`.**
