Functionality: **Determines if Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of purchases and the amount spent on each purchase, if possible.**

This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, respectively. It then checks if Alice has enough coins to buy the desired number of jewels. If she doesn't, it prints 'NO'. If she does, it checks if the number of jewels Bob wants is equal to the number of coins Alice has. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice. If the number of jewels Bob wants is less than the number of coins Alice has, it checks if the difference between the number of coins and the number of jewels plus 1 is greater than or equal to the number of jewels minus 1. If it is, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the difference between the number of coins and the number of jewels plus 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
