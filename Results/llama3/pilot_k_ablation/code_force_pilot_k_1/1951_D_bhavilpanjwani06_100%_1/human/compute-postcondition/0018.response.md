Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is also a positive integer.
* The current value of `k` minus 1 is less than the current value of `n` minus `k` plus 1. This implies that `n - k + 1` is greater than `k - 1`.
* The print statement is `print(n - k + 1, 1)`.

Since `n - k + 1` is greater than `k - 1`, and `k` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `n - k + 1` is at least 1 (because `k - 1` is at least 0).

Therefore, the print statement will output a value greater than or equal to 1, followed by the number 1.

Output: **a value greater than or equal to 1, 1**
