Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement `print(n - k + 1, 1)` will print two values:

1. `n - k + 1`: This expression calculates the difference between `n` and `k`, and then adds 1 to the result. Since `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`, we know that `n` is greater than `k`. Therefore, `n - k` will be a positive integer. Adding 1 to this result will give us another positive integer. Let's call this value `x`.

2. `1`: This is a literal integer value, which will be printed as is.

So, the output will be the value of `x` (which is `n - k + 1`) followed by the value `1`.

Output: **x (where x is the value of n - k + 1), 1**
