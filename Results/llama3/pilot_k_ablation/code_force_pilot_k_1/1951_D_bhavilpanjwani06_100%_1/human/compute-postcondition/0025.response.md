Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains t-1 lines of input. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1, and 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than `k`, then if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, `n-k+1`, and 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
