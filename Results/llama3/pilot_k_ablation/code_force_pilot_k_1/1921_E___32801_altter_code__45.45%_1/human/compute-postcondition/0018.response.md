Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on the input values of h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b, representing the height, width, and coordinates of two players. It reads input from stdin, processes one test case at a time, and prints the result ('draw', 'Alice', or 'bob') based on the relative positions of the players. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input values. It only prints the result and consumes one test case from stdin.**
