Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two players, Alice and Bob, on a grid. The function takes no parameters but reads six integers from standard input: the height and width of the grid, and the x and y coordinates of Alice and Bob. It then prints the winner of the game ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'draw') based on the relative positions of the players and the parity of the difference between their x-coordinates. The function does not return any value and only prints the result to the standard output.**
