The code reads a line from stdin, which contains six space-separated integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The values of these variables are now the integers read from stdin.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
