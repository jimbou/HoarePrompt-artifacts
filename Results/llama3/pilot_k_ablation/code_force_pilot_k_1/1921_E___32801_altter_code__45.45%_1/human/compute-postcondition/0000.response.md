Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, r is a list of six integers.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains six integers, and assigns them to the variables n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2. The values of these variables are now specific positive integers within the given ranges. The variable r is now a list of these six integers. Stdin now contains one less test case.
