Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and x2 is greater than x1. The current value of (x2 - x1) is odd. Additionally, the current values of y1 and y2 are equal, and 'Alice' is being printed**
