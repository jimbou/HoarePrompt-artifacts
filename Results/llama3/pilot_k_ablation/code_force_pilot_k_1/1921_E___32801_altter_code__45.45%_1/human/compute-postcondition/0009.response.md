Output: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, r is a list of six integers. The current value of x2 is larger than x1 and the difference between x2 and x1 is an odd number. Additionally, the current values of y1 and y2 are equal, and 'Alice' is being printed**
