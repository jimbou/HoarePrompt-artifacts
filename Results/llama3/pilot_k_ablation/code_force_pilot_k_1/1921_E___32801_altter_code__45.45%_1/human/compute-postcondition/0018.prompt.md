You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of six space-separated integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9.
    r = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2 = r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], r[4], r[5]
    if (x2 <= x1) :
        print('draw')
        #This is printed: draw
        return
        #The program returns nothing because there is no value or variable specified in the return statement.
    #State: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and x2 is greater than x1
    if ((x2 - x1) % 2 != 0) :
        if (y1 == y2) :
            print('Alice')
            #This is printed: Alice
            return
            #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 remain unchanged, with x2 being greater than x1, and y1 and y2 being equal. The program also still contains multiple test cases minus one in stdin, and 'Alice' has been printed.
        #State: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x2 is greater than x1, and the current value of (x2 - x1) is odd. Additionally, y1 is not equal to y2.
    else :
        if (y1 == y2) :
            print('bob')
            #This is printed: bob
            return
            #The program returns nothing, but the current values of y1 and y2 are equal, and 'bob' has been printed. The difference between x2 and x1 is even, and x2 is greater than x1. The values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 remain unchanged within their respective ranges.
        #State: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x2 is greater than x1, the difference between x2 and x1 is even, and y1 is not equal to y2

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing because there is no value or variable specified in the return statement.

Case_2: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x2 is greater than x1, and the current value of (x2 - x1) is odd. Additionally, y1 is not equal to y2.

Case_3: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x2 is greater than x1, the difference between x2 and x1 is even, and y1 is not equal to y2


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
