Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, and the difference between their x-coordinates is even. In this case, the program will incorrectly print "Draw" instead of "Alice".

For example, if the input is:

10 10 10 5 1 5

The program will print "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can win by moving her chip to the cell occupied by Bob's chip.

This case is not handled by the program because it only checks if the difference between the x-coordinates is odd, and if it is, it checks if the y-coordinates are the same. However, it does not check if the difference between the x-coordinates is even and the y-coordinates are the same, which is the case in this example.
