Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program fails is when Alice and Bob are on the same column, but Alice is not directly above or below Bob. In this case, the program incorrectly assumes that Alice can only move down or diagonally down, and does not consider the possibility of Alice moving diagonally up. 

For example, if the input is `10 10 2 5 8 5`, the program will incorrectly output "Draw", when in fact Alice can win by moving diagonally up.

The program also has a complex and convoluted logic, which makes it hard to understand and verify its correctness. It tries to simulate the game by moving Alice and Bob's chips, but it does not correctly handle all possible moves and positions.

To correctly solve this problem, a more straightforward approach would be to analyze the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips, and determine the outcome of the game based on their distances and directions. This would involve checking if Alice can reach Bob's position in an odd number of moves, and if Bob can block Alice's moves by moving to a position that would force Alice to move into a wall or out of the board.
