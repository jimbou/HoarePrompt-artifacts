Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the relative positions of the players and the dimensions of the board. The program considers all possible moves and their outcomes, and it correctly handles the cases where one player cannot make a move or where the game ends in a draw.

The program uses a combination of conditional statements and arithmetic operations to analyze the positions of the players and determine the winner. It also correctly handles the cases where the players are in the same column or row, and where one player is in a position to capture the other player's chip.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input from stdin, processing one test case at a time, and printing the result.

Correctness: **True**
