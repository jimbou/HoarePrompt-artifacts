Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, ar is a sorted list of integers, _ is 0**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is at least 1, `n` becomes the value of the first test case. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers from stdin to `ar`. Since stdin contains `t` test cases, `t-1` test cases remain in stdin after reading the first test case. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
