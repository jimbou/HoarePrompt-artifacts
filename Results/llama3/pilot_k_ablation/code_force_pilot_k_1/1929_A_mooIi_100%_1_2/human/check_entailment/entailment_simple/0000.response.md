Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input. Then, for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

The program sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted` function and stores the sorted array in the variable `ar`. This is done to ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, as the problem requires.

Finally, the program calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
