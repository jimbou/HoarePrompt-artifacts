Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved, as the largest differences are obtained by subtracting the smallest elements from the largest elements.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
*   When there are only two elements, the beauty is the difference between them.
*   When there are multiple elements, the beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The program also handles edge cases, such as:

*   When the input array is empty, the program does not attempt to calculate the beauty.
*   When the input array contains only one element, the program does not attempt to calculate the beauty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
