Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because it ensures that the differences are always positive, maximizing the beauty of the array.

The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the input as specified in the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
