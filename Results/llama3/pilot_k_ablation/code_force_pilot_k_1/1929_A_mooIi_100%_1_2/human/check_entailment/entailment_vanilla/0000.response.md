Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the correct number of test cases and array lengths.
2. It sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to maximize the beauty of the array. By sorting the array, the program ensures that the largest differences between consecutive elements are calculated.
3. The program calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct formula for calculating the beauty of the array.
4. The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

Based on this analysis, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
