Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting each node and its neighbors, and accumulates values based on the return values of the DFS function for each neighbor. The value c is incremented by 1 plus the sum of return values from neighbors with a return value less than a given non-negative integer y. The value r is incremented by the number of neighbors with a return value greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of return values from all neighbors. The function returns the final values of c and r after traversing the entire tree.
