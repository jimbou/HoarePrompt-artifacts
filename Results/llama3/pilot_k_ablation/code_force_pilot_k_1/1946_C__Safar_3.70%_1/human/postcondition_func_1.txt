This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on a given non-negative integer y. The value c represents 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes that are not visited and whose ans is less than y, while the value r represents the sum of all rn values from nodes that are not visited plus the number of nodes that are not visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If the node x has no neighbors, the function returns (1, 0).
