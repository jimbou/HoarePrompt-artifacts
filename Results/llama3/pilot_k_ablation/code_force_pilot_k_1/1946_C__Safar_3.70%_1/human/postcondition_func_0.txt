The function takes a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` where `k < n`, and a list of pairs of integers `edges` representing a tree with nodes between 1 and `n` (inclusive). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and performs a binary search to find a value `r` such that a certain condition is met (determined by the `check` function). The function then prints the value of `r`, which is either 0 or `n // k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`.
