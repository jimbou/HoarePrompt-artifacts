Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the binary search approach used in `func_1`. The `check` function is used to determine if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. However, the `check` function only checks if the size of the connected component is greater than or equal to `x` and if the number of edges removed is greater than or equal to `k`. It does not guarantee that the size of each remaining connected component is exactly `x`.

A counterexample is when `n = 6`, `k = 1`, and the edges are `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]`. The program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `2`. The program incorrectly assumes that the size of each connected component can be exactly `x`, which is not always the case.

In this example, removing the edge `(3, 4)` will result in two connected components of size `3` and `3`, respectively. However, the program will output `3` because it thinks that the size of each connected component can be exactly `3`, which is not possible in this case.
