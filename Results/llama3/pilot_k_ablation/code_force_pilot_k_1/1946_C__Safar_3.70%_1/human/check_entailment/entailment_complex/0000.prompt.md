Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Annotated Functions:
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))

        print(n, k, edges)
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n, representing the edges of a tree with n vertices.
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where `g[i]` contains all the vertices `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the tree.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers `(a, b)` where `1 <= a, b <= n`, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where `g[i]` contains all the vertices `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the tree, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is either `n // k + 1` or `n // k + 1` if `check` returns `True` for all values, `r` is either 0 or `n // k` if `check` returns `False` for all values, `mid` is not defined after the loop as it is a temporary variable.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: 0 (if check returns True for all values) or n // k (if check returns False for all values)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `k` < `n`, and a list of pairs of integers `edges` representing the edges of a tree with `n` vertices as input. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to find the maximum value `r` such that the `check` function returns `False` for all values up to `r`. The function then prints the value of `r`, which is either 0 if `check` returns `True` for all values or `n // k` if `check` returns `False` for all values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, and visited is a set of visited nodes.
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all its neighbors, c is 1 plus the sum of the return values of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x whose return value is less than y, r is the original value of r plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x whose return value of the dfs function is greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of the return values of rn from the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the return values of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of node x whose return value is less than the non-negative integer y. r is the original value of r plus the number of unvisited neighbors of node x whose return value of the dfs function is greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of the return values of r from the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of node x.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting each node and its neighbors, and accumulates values based on the return values of the DFS function for each neighbor. The value c is incremented by 1 plus the sum of return values from neighbors with a return value less than a given non-negative integer y. The value r is incremented by the number of neighbors with a return value greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of return values from all neighbors. The function returns the final values of c and r after traversing the entire tree.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is a set or list that keeps track of visited nodes, and dfs is a function that takes two parameters (a node and an integer) and returns a tuple of two values (a boolean and an integer).
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, which is a boolean value indicating a true condition, regardless of the values of x, k, visited, ans, and r.
    #State: *x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is an empty set or list, ans is a boolean, and r is an integer. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. It takes a positive integer x and a non-negative integer k as input, and uses a DFS function to traverse a graph or tree. The function returns True if the DFS operation yields a result that satisfies the condition (ans >= x and r >= k), and False otherwise. The function also clears a visited set or list before performing the DFS operation, and its return value is independent of the values of x, k, visited, ans, and r.
