Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Annotated Functions:

for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):

        print(n, k, edges)
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents an edge in the tree, and the integers in each pair are between 1 and n (inclusive).
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents an edge in the tree, and the integers in each pair are between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the tree.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents an edge in the tree, and the integers in each pair are between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the tree, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is either `n // k + 1` or `r` is 0, `r` is either 0 or `l - 1`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: 0 or l - 1 (where l is either n // k + 1 or r is 0)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` where `k < n`, and a list of pairs of integers `edges` representing a tree with nodes between 1 and `n` (inclusive). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and performs a binary search to find a value `r` such that a certain condition is met (determined by the `check` function). The function then prints the value of `r`, which is either 0 or `n // k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of visited nodes.
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all nodes in g[x], c is 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is less than y, r is the sum of all rn values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited plus the number of nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If g[x] is empty, then c is 1 and r is 0.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is less than y. r is the sum of all rn values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited plus the number of nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If g[x] is empty, then c is 1 and r is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on a given non-negative integer y. The value c represents 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes that are not visited and whose ans is less than y, while the value r represents the sum of all rn values from nodes that are not visited plus the number of nodes that are not visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If the node x has no neighbors, the function returns (1, 0).

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is a set, and dfs is a function that takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values.
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: *x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is an empty set, ans and r are the two values returned by the dfs function when called with arguments 1 and x. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns boolean value False.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. The function takes no arguments, but relies on external variables x (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer). It clears a set called visited, performs a DFS operation with arguments 1 and x, and checks if the returned values meet a specific condition (ans >= x and r >= k). If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
