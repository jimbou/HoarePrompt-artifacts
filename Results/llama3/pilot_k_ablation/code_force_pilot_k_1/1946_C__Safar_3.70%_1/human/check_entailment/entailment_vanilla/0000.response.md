Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. It then uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. The search space is defined by the range [1, n // k + 1], where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

3. For each mid value in the search space, the program calls the check function to determine if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid.

4. The check function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree. It keeps track of the number of vertices visited (c) and the number of edges that need to be removed (r) to ensure that each connected component has at least x vertices.

5. If the check function returns True, it means that it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid. In this case, the program updates the left boundary of the search space to mid + 1.

6. If the check function returns False, it means that it is not possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid. In this case, the program updates the right boundary of the search space to mid - 1.

7. The program repeats steps 3-6 until the search space is empty, at which point it prints the maximum value of x that satisfies the condition.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
