Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

 Output hints for function1:  This function takes a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `k` < `n`, and a list of pairs of integers `edges` representing the edges of a tree with `n` vertices as input. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to find the maximum value `r` such that the `check` function returns `False` for all values up to `r`. The function then prints the value of `r`, which is either 0 if `check` returns `True` for all values or `n // k` if `check` returns `False` for all values.
Function number 2 :

 '''
def dfs(x, y):

 Output hints for function2:  Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting each node and its neighbors, and accumulates values based on the return values of the DFS function for each neighbor. The value c is incremented by 1 plus the sum of return values from neighbors with a return value less than a given non-negative integer y. The value r is incremented by the number of neighbors with a return value greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of return values from all neighbors. The function returns the final values of c and r after traversing the entire tree.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:
        return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. It takes a positive integer x and a non-negative integer k as input, and uses a DFS function to traverse a graph or tree. The function returns True if the DFS operation yields a result that satisfies the condition (ans >= x and r >= k), and False otherwise. The function also clears a visited set or list before performing the DFS operation, and its return value is independent of the values of x, k, visited, ans, and r.
