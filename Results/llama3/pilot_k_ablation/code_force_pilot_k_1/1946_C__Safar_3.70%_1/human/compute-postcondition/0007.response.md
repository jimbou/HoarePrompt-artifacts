Output State: **`x` is a node in the tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where `g[x]` must have at least 1 node, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x` and possibly other nodes, `c` is 1 plus `ans`, `r` is equal to its original value plus `rn`, `node` is the first node in `g[x]`, and the current value of `node` is in the set of visited nodes, and `ans` is less than `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been updated to be 1 plus the current value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being a node in the tree, `y` being a non-negative integer, `g` representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` containing `x` and possibly other nodes, `r` being equal to its original value plus `rn`, `node` being the first node in `g[x]` and in the set of visited nodes, and `ans` being less than `y`.
