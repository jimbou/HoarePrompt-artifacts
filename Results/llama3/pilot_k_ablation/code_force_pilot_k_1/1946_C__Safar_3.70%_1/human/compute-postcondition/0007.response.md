The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is the return value of the `dfs` function, which is less than `y`. The value of `y` is a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a node in a tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree that must have at least 1 node, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x` and the first node in the list, `c` is 1 plus the return value of the `dfs` function, `r` is the original value of `r` plus the return value of `rn` from the `dfs` function, `node` is the first node in the list, `ans` is the return value of the `dfs` function, which is less than `y`.**
