Postcondition: ***x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where g[x] must have at least 1 node, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and possibly other nodes, node is the first node in g[x]. If node is not in the set of visited nodes, then the set of visited nodes is updated to include node. If ans is greater than or equal to y, then r is equal to its original value plus rn plus 1. Otherwise, c is 1 plus ans, and r is equal to its original value plus rn. If node is already in the set of visited nodes, then no changes are made to the variables.***
