Postcondition: ***x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree that must have at least 1 node, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If the first node in the list has not been visited, then after visiting it, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and the first node in the list. If the return value of the dfs function is greater than or equal to y, then r is the original value of r plus 1 plus the return value of rn from the dfs function and c is 1. Otherwise, r is the original value of r plus the return value of rn from the dfs function and c is 1 plus the return value of the dfs function. If the first node in the list has been visited, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
