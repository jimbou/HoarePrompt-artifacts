Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is less than y. r is the sum of all rn values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited plus the number of nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If g[x] is empty, then c is 1 and r is 0.**
