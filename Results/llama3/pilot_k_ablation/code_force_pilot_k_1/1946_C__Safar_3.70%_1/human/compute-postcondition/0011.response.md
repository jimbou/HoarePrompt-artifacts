Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of the return values of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of node x whose return value is less than the non-negative integer y. r is the original value of r plus the number of unvisited neighbors of node x whose return value of the dfs function is greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of the return values of r from the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of node x.**
