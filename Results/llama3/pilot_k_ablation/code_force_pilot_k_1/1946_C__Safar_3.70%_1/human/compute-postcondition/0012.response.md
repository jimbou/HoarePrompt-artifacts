Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting each node and its neighbors, and updates the values of c and r based on the return values of the DFS function for each neighbor. The value of c is incremented by 1 plus the sum of the return values of the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of node x whose return value is less than a given non-negative integer y. The value of r is incremented by the number of unvisited neighbors of node x whose return value of the DFS function is greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of the return values of r from the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of node x. The function returns the final values of c and r after traversing the entire tree.
