Functionality: **Determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. The function takes no arguments, but relies on external variables x (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer). It clears a set called visited, performs a DFS operation with arguments 1 and x, and checks if the returned values meet a specific condition (ans >= x and r >= k). If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
