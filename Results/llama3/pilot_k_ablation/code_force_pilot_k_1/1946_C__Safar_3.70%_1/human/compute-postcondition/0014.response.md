The code prints the value of `r` which is either 0 or `l - 1`.
Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents an edge in the tree, and the integers in each pair are between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the nodes `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the tree, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is either `n // k + 1` or `r` is 0, `r` is either 0 or `l - 1`, and the value of `r` is being printed**
