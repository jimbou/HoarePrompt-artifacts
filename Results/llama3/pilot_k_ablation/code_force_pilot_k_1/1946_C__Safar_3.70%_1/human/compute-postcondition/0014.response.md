Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers `(a, b)` where `1 <= a, b <= n`, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where `g[i]` contains all the vertices `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the tree, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is either `n // k + 1` or `n // k + 1` if `check` returns `True` for all values, `r` is either 0 or `n // k` if `check` returns `False` for all values, `mid` is not defined after the loop as it is a temporary variable, and the value of `r` is being printed, which is either 0 or `n // k`**
