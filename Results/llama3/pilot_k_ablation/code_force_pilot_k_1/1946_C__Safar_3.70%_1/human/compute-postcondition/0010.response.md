Output State: **x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all nodes in g[x], c is 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is less than y, r is the sum of all rn values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited plus the number of nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If g[x] is empty, then c is 1 and r is 0.**
