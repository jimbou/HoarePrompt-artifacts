Output State: **x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all its neighbors, c is 1 plus the sum of the return values of the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x whose return value is less than y, r is the original value of r plus the number of unvisited neighbors of x whose return value of the dfs function is greater than or equal to y, plus the sum of the return values of rn from the dfs function for all unvisited neighbors of x.**
