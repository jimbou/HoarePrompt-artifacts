Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `k` < `n`, and a list of pairs of integers `edges` representing the edges of a tree with `n` vertices as input. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to find the maximum value `r` such that the `check` function returns `False` for all values up to `r`. The function then prints the value of `r`, which is either 0 if `check` returns `True` for all values or `n // k` if `check` returns `False` for all values.**
