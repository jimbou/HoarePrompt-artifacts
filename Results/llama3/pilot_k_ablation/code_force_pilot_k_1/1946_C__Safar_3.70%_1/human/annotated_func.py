    #This is printed: 0 or l - 1 (where l is either n // k + 1 or r is 0)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` where `k < n`, and a list of pairs of integers `edges` representing a tree with nodes between 1 and `n` (inclusive). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and performs a binary search to find a value `r` such that a certain condition is met (determined by the `check` function). The function then prints the value of `r`, which is either 0 or `n // k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`.

    #State: x is a node in the tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all nodes in g[x], c is 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is less than y, r is the sum of all rn values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited plus the number of nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If g[x] is empty, then c is 1 and r is 0.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is less than y. r is the sum of all rn values from nodes in g[x] that are not in visited plus the number of nodes in g[x] that are not in visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If g[x] is empty, then c is 1 and r is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function traverses the tree, visiting nodes and their neighbors, and accumulates values based on a given non-negative integer y. The value c represents 1 plus the sum of all ans values from nodes that are not visited and whose ans is less than y, while the value r represents the sum of all rn values from nodes that are not visited plus the number of nodes that are not visited and whose ans is greater than or equal to y. If the node x has no neighbors, the function returns (1, 0).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is a set, and dfs is a function that takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values.

    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: *x is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, visited is an empty set, ans and r are the two values returned by the dfs function when called with arguments 1 and x. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns boolean value False.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. The function takes no arguments, but relies on external variables x (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer). It clears a set called visited, performs a DFS operation with arguments 1 and x, and checks if the returned values meet a specific condition (ans >= x and r >= k). If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
