#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers and index is an integer such that 2 <= index <= len(array) - 2.

    #The program returns a list of integers where the element at index - 1 is one less than its original value, the element at index is two less than its original value, and the element at index + 1 is one less than its original value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decrements the elements at the specified index and its neighbors in a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers.

    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the function has executed successfully without returning False, and the last integer in the list arrayForSuccess is 0 if the list is not empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if all elements in the input list `arrayForSuccess` are 0. It returns `True` if all elements are 0 or if the list is empty, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, and answers is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function.

    #State: `loop_counter` is 100, `answers` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `inputarray` is a list of integers, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, and `highestNumber` is the value of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns True at any point, `answers` contains 'YES' and the loop exits early. If `func_2(inputarray)` never returns True, `answers` contains 'NO' and the loop runs for 99 iterations.
    answers.append('NO')

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of integers can be transformed into a desired state by repeatedly applying a transformation function (func_1) and checking a condition function (func_2). It takes an input array and a list to store answers as parameters. If the condition function returns True at any point, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns without changing the input array. If the condition function never returns True after 99 iterations, it appends 'NO' to the answers list. The function does not return any value explicitly, but modifies the answers list based on the transformation and condition checks.
