Output State: **highestIndex is 1, highestNumber is the value of inputarray[1], inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 3, elementIndex is 1, func_2(inputarray) returns False**

The code updates the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` based on the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. Since `elementIndex` is 1, `highestIndex` becomes 1, and `highestNumber` becomes the value of `inputarray[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
