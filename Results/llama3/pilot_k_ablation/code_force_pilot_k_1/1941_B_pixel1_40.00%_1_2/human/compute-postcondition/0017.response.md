Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `answers` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' and 'NO', `inputarray` is a list of integers, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, and `highestNumber` is the value of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns True at any point, `answers` contains 'YES' and the loop exits early. If `func_2(inputarray)` never returns True, `answers` contains 'NO' and the loop runs for 99 iterations.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `answers` has been updated to include 'NO' in addition to its previous value, which could be either 'YES' or 'NO'. All other variables remain unchanged. The loop counter is still at 100, and the input array, its length, the highest index, and the highest number remain the same. The condition for the loop exit based on `func_2(inputarray)` also remains the same.
