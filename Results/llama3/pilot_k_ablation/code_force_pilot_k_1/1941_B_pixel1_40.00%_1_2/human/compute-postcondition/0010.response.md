Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 1, and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returns False. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 1 and `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[1]`.***
