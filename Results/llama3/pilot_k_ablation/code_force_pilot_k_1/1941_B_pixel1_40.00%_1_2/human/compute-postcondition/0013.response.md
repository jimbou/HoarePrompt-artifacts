The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function and contains the string 'NO', `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is -1, and `highestNumber` is -1, which is less than 0.
