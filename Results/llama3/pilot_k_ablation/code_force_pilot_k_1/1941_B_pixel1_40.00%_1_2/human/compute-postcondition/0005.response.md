The only variable in the loop head is variable `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `loop_counter` is 1, which is not equal to 100, so the loop can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function, `loop_counter` is 1, and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returns False**
