Functionality: **This function determines whether a given list of integers can be transformed into a desired state by repeatedly applying a transformation function (func_1) and checking a condition function (func_2). It takes an input array and a list to store answers as parameters. If the condition function returns True at any point, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns without changing the input array. If the condition function never returns True after 99 iterations, it appends 'NO' to the answers list. The function does not return any value explicitly, but modifies the answers list based on the transformation and condition checks.**
