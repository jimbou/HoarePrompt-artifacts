Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function, loop_counter is 1, length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, and the function func_2(inputarray) returns False.**

In this output state, the code has introduced three new variables: `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`. The value of `length` is determined by the number of elements in the `inputarray`. The variables `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are initialized to -1, indicating that no highest number or index has been found yet. The rest of the variables and the function `func_2(inputarray)` remain unchanged.
