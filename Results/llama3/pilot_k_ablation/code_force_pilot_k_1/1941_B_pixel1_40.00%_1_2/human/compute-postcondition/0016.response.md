Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `answers` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `inputarray` is a list of integers, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, and `highestNumber` is the value of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns True at any point, `answers` contains 'YES' and the loop exits early. If `func_2(inputarray)` never returns True, `answers` contains 'NO' and the loop runs for 99 iterations.**
