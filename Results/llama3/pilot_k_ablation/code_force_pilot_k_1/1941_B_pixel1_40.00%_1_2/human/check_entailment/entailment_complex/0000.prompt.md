Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Annotated Functions:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers and index is an integer such that 2 <= index <= len(array) - 2.
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array
    #The program returns a list of integers where the element at index - 1 is one less than its original value, the element at index is two less than its original value, and the element at index + 1 is one less than its original value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decrements the elements at the specified index and its neighbors in a list of integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers.
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers, all elements in arrayForSuccess are 0, x is the last integer in the list, if arrayForSuccess is empty then the loop does not execute and the function does not return False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the function has executed successfully without returning False, and the last integer in the list arrayForSuccess is 0 if the list is not empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if all elements in the input list `arrayForSuccess` are 0. It returns `True` if all elements are 0 or if the list is empty, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, and answers is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function.
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of `answers` remains unchanged, still containing the string 'YES', and the value of `func_2(inputarray)` remains True. The `inputarray` also remains unchanged.
    #State: *inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function, and the function func_2(inputarray) returns False
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: `loop_counter` is 100, `answers` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `inputarray` is a list of integers, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, and `highestNumber` is the value of the highest number in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns True at any point, `answers` contains 'YES' and the loop exits early. If `func_2(inputarray)` never returns True, `answers` contains 'NO' and the loop runs for 99 iterations.
    answers.append('NO')

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of integers can be transformed into a desired state by repeatedly applying a transformation function (func_1) and checking a condition function (func_2). It takes an input array and a list to store answers as parameters. If the condition function returns True at any point, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns without changing the input array. If the condition function never returns True after 99 iterations, it appends 'NO' to the answers list. The function does not return any value explicitly, but modifies the answers list based on the transformation and condition checks.
