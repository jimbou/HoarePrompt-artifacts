Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_3(inputarray)`. The function attempts to find the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation at that index. However, this approach is not guaranteed to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input: `[1, 2, 7, 2]`

The program will apply the operation at index 2 (since 7 is the highest number), resulting in `[1, 1, 5, 1]`. However, it is not possible to make all elements of this array equal to zero using the described operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
