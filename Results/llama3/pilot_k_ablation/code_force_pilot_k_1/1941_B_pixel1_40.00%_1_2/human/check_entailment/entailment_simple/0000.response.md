Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 <= i <= n-2.

The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 performs the operation on the array, func_2 checks if all elements in the array are zero, and func_3 is the main function that iterates through the array and applies the operation until all elements are zero or it is determined that it is not possible to make all elements zero.

The program correctly implements the operation and checks for the conditions under which it is possible to make all elements zero. It also correctly handles the case where it is not possible to make all elements zero.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In func_3, the loop_counter variable is used to limit the number of iterations to 100. This means that if the array has more than 100 elements, the program may not be able to make all elements zero even if it is possible to do so. This could lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False** due to the potential issue with the loop_counter variable.

Correctness: **False**
