Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(array, index)`: This function applies the operation to the array at the specified index.
2. `func_2(arrayForSuccess)`: This function checks if all elements in the array are equal to zero.
3. `func_3(inputarray)`: This function is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the operation.

The `func_3` function works as follows:

- It first checks if the input array is already all zeros using `func_2`. If it is, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns.
- If the array is not all zeros, it enters a loop that runs up to 100 times.
- In each iteration of the loop, it finds the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements).
- If the highest number is negative, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns.
- Otherwise, it applies the operation to the array at the index of the highest number using `func_1`.
- It then checks if the resulting array is all zeros using `func_2`. If it is, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns.
- If the loop completes 100 iterations without finding a solution, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to determine whether Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation.

Correctness: **True**
