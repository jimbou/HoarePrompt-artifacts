Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the operation of deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program works by iterating through each element in the input array. If the element is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, it checks if the integer part of the element is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c`. If it is, and the integer part is less than or equal to the last digit of the element, it appends the integer part and the last digit to the list `c`. Otherwise, it appends the original element to the list `c`. If the element is not greater than 10 or its index is 0, it simply appends the element to the list `c`.

After processing all elements in the input array, the program checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-descending order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that it is possible to make a sorted array. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list `b`.

The program repeats this process for each test case and finally prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in the list `b` is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
