Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the array has only one element and that element is greater than 10. In this case, the program will not split the element into its digits and check if the resulting array is sorted. 

For example, if the input is:

1
12

The program will output 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because the array can be transformed into [1, 2] which is sorted.

The program only checks if the first element is greater than 10 and if it is, it splits it into its digits. However, it does not do the same for the rest of the elements in the array. It only checks if the current element is greater than 10 and if the previous element is less than or equal to the current element. This is not enough to determine if the array can be transformed into a sorted array.

To fix this, the program should check each element in the array and split it into its digits if it is greater than 10. Then, it should check if the resulting array is sorted.
