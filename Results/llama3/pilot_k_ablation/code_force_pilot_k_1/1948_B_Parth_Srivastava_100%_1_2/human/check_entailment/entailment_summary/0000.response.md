Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the specified operation any number of times. The program reads a test case from standard input, processes the integers, splits any integer greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, and stores them in a list. It then checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order.

Upon reviewing the program, it appears to be correct. The program correctly implements the specified operation, splitting integers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, and checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order. The program also handles multiple test cases as specified by the initial integer t read from standard input.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function func_1() is called before it is defined. In Python, you need to define a function before you can call it. To fix this, you can move the definition of func_1() above the loop that calls it.

Correctness: **False**
