Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the integer at index i in list a, y is the integer at index i in list a divided by 10. If y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1], then if y is less than or equal to x, n is 2 and c is a list with at least three elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Otherwise, n is 1 and c is a list with at least two elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If y is less than c[n - 1], then n is 1, c is a list containing the integer at index i in list a, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a[i] is not greater than 10 or i is 0, then if a[i] is greater than 10, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the integer part of the current value of a[i]. If the integer part of the current value of a[i] is less than or equal to the last digit of the current value of a[i], then n is 2 and c is a list containing the integer part and the last digit of the current value of a[i]. Otherwise, n is 1 and c is a list containing the value of a[i]. If either i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c is a list containing one integer which is the value of a[i].***
