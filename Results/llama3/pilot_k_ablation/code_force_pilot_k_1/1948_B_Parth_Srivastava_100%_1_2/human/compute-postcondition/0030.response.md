Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of the last integer in list `a` if the last integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer part of the last integer in list `a` if the last integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is the length of list `c`, `c` is a list containing integers from list `a`, either as single elements or as pairs of integer part and last digit if the integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, `d` is a sorted list of integers from list `c`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, list `c` is not equal to list `d`, and `b` is a list that has been appended with the value 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that list `b` now contains the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
