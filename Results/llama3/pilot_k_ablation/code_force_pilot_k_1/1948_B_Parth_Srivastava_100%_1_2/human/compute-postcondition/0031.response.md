Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of the last integer in list `a` if the last integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer part of the last integer in list `a` if the last integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is the length of list `c`, `c` is a list containing integers from list `a`, either as single elements or as pairs of integer part and last digit if the integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, `d` is a sorted list of integers from list `c`, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If `c` is equal to `d`, then `b` is a list that has been appended with 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list that has been appended with 0.***
