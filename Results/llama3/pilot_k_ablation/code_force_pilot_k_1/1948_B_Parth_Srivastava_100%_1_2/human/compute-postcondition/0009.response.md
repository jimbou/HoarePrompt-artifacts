Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in list a, y is the integer at index i in list a divided by 10, i is greater than 0 and the current value of a at index i is greater than 10. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c is a list with at least three elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Otherwise, n is 1 and c is a list with at least two elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
