Output State: **k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the integer part of the current value of a[i], n is 2, c is a list containing the integer part and the last digit of the current value of a[i], stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. The integer part of the current value of a[i] is less than or equal to the last digit of the current value of a[i].**

The code block appends the integer part and the last digit of the current value of a[i] to the list c, and increments the value of n by 2. The value of k, a, x, y, stdin, and i remain unchanged.
