Output State: **k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in list a, y is the integer at index i in list a divided by 10, n is 1, c is a list with at least two elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is greater than 0 and the current value of a at index i is greater than 10.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `a` at index `i` has been appended to list `c`. The value of `x` and `y` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1. The value of `i` remains greater than 0, and the current value of `a` at index `i` remains greater than 10.
