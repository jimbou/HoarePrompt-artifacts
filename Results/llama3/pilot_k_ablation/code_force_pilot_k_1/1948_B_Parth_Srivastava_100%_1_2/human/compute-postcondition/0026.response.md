Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of the last integer in list `a` if the last integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer part of the last integer in list `a` if the last integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is the length of list `c`, `c` is a list containing integers from list `a`, either as single elements or as pairs of integer part and last digit if the integer is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, `d` is a sorted list of integers from list `c`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` remains unchanged, `a` is still a list of integers, `x` and `y` are still dependent on the last integer in list `a`, `n` is still the length of list `c`, list `c` is still a list containing integers from list `a` with possible pairs of integer part and last digit, and a new variable `d` is introduced which is a sorted list of integers from list `c`. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
