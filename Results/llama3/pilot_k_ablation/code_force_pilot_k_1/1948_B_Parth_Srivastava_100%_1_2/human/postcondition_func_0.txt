This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then processes these integers, splitting any integer greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, and stores them in a list. The function checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function appends 1 to a list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function repeats this process for multiple test cases, as specified by an initial integer t read from standard input.
