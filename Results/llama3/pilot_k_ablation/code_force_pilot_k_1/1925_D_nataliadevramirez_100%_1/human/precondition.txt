t is a positive integer, for each test case, n is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a non-negative integer such that m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is a positive integer such that k <= 2*10^5, for each of the m pairs of friends, a_i and b_i are distinct positive integers less than or equal to n, and f_i is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9.
