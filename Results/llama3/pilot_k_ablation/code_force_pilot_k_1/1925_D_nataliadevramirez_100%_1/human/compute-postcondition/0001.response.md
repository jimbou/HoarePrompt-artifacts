To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need a specific value). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains 3 integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. n is the number of children, m is the number of pairs of friends, and k is the number of excursions. a_i and b_i are the indices of the pair of children who are friends, and f_i is their friendship value. 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, and a_i != b_i. MOD is 1000000007.**
