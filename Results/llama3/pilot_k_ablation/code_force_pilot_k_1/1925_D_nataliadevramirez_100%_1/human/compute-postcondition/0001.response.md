The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, MOD is 1000000007 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`T` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, MOD is 1000000007**
