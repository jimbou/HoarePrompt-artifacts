Output State: **T is an integer that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, MOD is 1000000007, n is an integer, p is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**

In this output state, the values of `T`, `_`, and `MOD` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `p`, and `k`, respectively. The variable `S` is initialized to 0. Since one test case is read from stdin, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by one.
