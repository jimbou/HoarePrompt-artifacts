Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, p is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n(n-1)/2) inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, S is 0.**

The code reads the next test case from stdin, which contains three integers n, p, and k. The value of n is between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, p is between 0 and min(10^5, n(n-1)/2) inclusive, and k is between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive. The variable S is initialized to 0. The values of T and _ remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
