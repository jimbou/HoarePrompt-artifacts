Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, MOD is 1000000007, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is the sum of the third elements of p input strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus p plus one test cases, p is greater than or equal to 0, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k - p*k + 2*k*C*S) / gcd(p*k*k - p*k + 2*k*C*S, 2*C*C), den is pow(2*C*C, -1, MOD), ans is (num * den) % MOD, g is gcd(p*k*k - p*k + 2*k*C*S, 2*C*C).**

The code calculates the value of `C` as `n*(n-1)/2`, which is the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time. It then calculates the numerator `num` of a fraction as `p*k*k - p*k + 2*k*C*S`, where `S` is the sum of the third elements of `p` input strings. The denominator `den` is calculated as `2*C*C`. The code then calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `num` and `den` using the `math.gcd` function. The values of `num` and `den` are then divided by `g` to simplify the fraction. The denominator `den` is then inverted modulo `MOD` using the `pow` function. Finally, the code calculates the value of `ans` as the product of `num` and `den` modulo `MOD`. The value of `g` is also stored. The values of `T`, `_`, `MOD`, `n`, `k`, `S`, `stdin`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.
