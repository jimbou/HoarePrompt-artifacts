Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, p is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n(n-1)/2) inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, S is equal to the third integer of the next test case, i is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains greater than 0, the value of _ remains 0, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by one, the values of n, p, and k remain unchanged, the value of S is updated to the third integer of the next test case, and the value of i remains 0.
