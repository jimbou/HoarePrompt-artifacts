Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. It calculates the probability of a child going on an excursion with a friend, given the friendship values and the number of excursions. The function then prints the result for each test case, modulo 1,000,000,007. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and does not retain any information from the input.**
