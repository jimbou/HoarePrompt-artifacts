Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, followed by t sets of input. Each set of input contains an integer k, followed by k lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, f_i. It then calculates a value based on the input and prints the result for each test case, modulo 1000000007. The function consumes all input from standard input and leaves it empty.**
