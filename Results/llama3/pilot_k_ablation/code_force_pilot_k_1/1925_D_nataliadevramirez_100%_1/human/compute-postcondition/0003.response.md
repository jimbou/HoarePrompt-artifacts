The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If p is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, T is an integer that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, MOD is 1000000007, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `p` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **T is an integer that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, MOD is 1000000007, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, p is greater than 0, i is 0**
