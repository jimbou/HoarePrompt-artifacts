According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If `p` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, p is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n(n-1)/2) inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, S is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `p` is greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, p is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n(n-1)/2) inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, S is 0, i is 0**
