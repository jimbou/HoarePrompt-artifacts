The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the result of the expression `(num * den) % MOD`. 

Here, `num` is the result of the expression `(p*k*k - p*k + 2*k*C*S) / g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p*k*k - p*k + 2*k*C*S` and `2*C*C`. 

`den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`, which is calculated using the `pow` function with a negative exponent.

The value of `ans` is the product of `num` and `den`, taken modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact values of `p`, `k`, `C`, `S`, and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of the expression (num * den) % MOD, with num and den calculated based on the given formulas and variables)**
