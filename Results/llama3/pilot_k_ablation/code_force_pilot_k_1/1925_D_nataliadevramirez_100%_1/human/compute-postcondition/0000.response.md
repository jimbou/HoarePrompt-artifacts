Output State: **T is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains 3 integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. n is the number of children, m is the number of pairs of friends, and k is the number of excursions. a_i and b_i are the indices of the pair of children who are friends, and f_i is their friendship value. 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, and a_i != b_i. MOD is 1000000007.**

The first line assigns the value of the first test case to T. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, it now contains one less test case. The second line assigns the value 1000000007 to MOD. No other variables are affected.
