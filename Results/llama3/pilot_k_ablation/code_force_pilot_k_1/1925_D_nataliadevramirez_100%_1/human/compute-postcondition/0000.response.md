Output State: **T is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, MOD is 1000000007**

The first line assigns the value of 1000000007 to MOD. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to T. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and one test case has been read, stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case. No other variables are affected.
