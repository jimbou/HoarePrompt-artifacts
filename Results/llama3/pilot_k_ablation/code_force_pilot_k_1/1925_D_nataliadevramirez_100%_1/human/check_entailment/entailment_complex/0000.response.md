Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (p), and the number of excursions (k).

2. It then calculates the sum of the initial friendship values (S) by iterating over each pair of friends and adding their friendship value.

3. The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (C) using the formula n * (n - 1) // 2.

4. It then calculates the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The numerator is calculated as p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, and the denominator is calculated as 2 * C * C.

5. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (g) of the numerator and denominator using the math.gcd function, and divides both the numerator and denominator by this value to simplify the fraction.

6. It then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator (den) using the pow function with a negative exponent, and multiplies this with the numerator to get the final answer (ans).

7. Finally, the program prints the answer modulo 1000000007 for each test case.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, and it handles the input and output correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
