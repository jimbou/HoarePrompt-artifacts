Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of friendship values, and then calculates the probability of a child going on an excursion with a friend.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated as the sum of the products of each friendship value and its probability. However, the program calculates the expected value as the sum of the products of the number of pairs, the number of excursions, and the sum of friendship values, which is incorrect.

2.  The program does not correctly calculate the probability of a child going on an excursion with a friend. The probability should be calculated as the number of pairs of friends divided by the total number of pairs of children. However, the program calculates the probability as the number of pairs of friends divided by the square of the total number of pairs of children, which is incorrect.

3.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of pairs of children is zero. In this case, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to calculate the probability.

4.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of excursions is zero. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

5.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of friendship values is zero. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

6.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of pairs of friends is zero. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

7.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of children is zero. In this case, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to calculate the probability.

8.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of children is one. In this case, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to calculate the probability.

9.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of children is two. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

10. The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of excursions is one. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

11. The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of excursions is two. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

12. The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of friendship values is one. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

13. The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of friendship values is two. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

14. The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of pairs of friends is one. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

15. The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of pairs of friends is two. In this case, the program will return a incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**
