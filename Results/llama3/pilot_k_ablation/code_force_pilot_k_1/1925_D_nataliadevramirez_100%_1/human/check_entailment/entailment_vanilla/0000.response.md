Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. It then calculates the sum of the initial friendship values.

The program then calculates the numerator and denominator of the expected value. The numerator is calculated as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, where `p` is the number of pairs of friends, `k` is the number of excursions, `C` is the total number of possible pairs of children, and `S` is the sum of the initial friendship values. The denominator is calculated as `2 * C * C`.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator using the `math.gcd` function and divides both the numerator and denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.

Finally, the program calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator using the `pow` function with a negative exponent, multiplies the numerator by the modular multiplicative inverse, and takes the result modulo `MOD` to get the final answer.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formula for the expected value and uses modular arithmetic to avoid overflow. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
