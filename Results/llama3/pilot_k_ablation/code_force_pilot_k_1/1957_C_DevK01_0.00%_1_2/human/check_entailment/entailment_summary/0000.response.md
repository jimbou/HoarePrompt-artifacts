Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.

The `func_1` function takes an integer `x` as input and returns the result of calling the `helper` function with `x` as an argument. The `helper` function calculates and returns a value based on the input `len`, which is a non-negative integer.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations possible. It first reads the input values `n` and `k`, which represent the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. It then iterates over the `k` moves, updating the value of `n` based on whether the move is a diagonal move (i.e., `a != b`) or a non-diagonal move (i.e., `a == b`).

After updating `n`, the program calls the `func_1` function with `n` as an argument, which in turn calls the `helper` function to calculate the number of different final configurations possible. The `helper` function uses memoization to avoid redundant computations and returns the calculated value.

The program correctly implements the problem's logic and uses memoization to optimize the calculation. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
