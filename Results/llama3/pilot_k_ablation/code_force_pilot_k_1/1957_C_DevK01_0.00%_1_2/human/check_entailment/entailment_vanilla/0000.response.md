Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The game involves placing white rooks and black rooks on an n x n chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.

The given program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `helper` function calculates the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `len`. The base case is when `len` is 0 or 1, in which case there is only one way to place the rooks.

For `len` greater than 1, the function calculates the number of ways to place rooks by considering two cases:

1.  The first rook is placed on the diagonal. In this case, the remaining `len - 1` rooks can be placed in `helper(len - 1)` ways.
2.  The first rook is not placed on the diagonal. In this case, there are `len - 1` choices for the row and `len - 1` choices for the column, and the remaining `len - 2` rooks can be placed in `helper(len - 2)` ways. Since there are two ways to place the first rook (either horizontally or vertically), we multiply the result by 2.

The final result is the sum of these two cases.

The `func_1` function initializes an empty dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems and calls the `helper` function with the input `x`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

*   The `func_1` function does not take into account the number of moves `k` that have already been played. The `helper` function only calculates the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `len`, but it does not consider the moves that have already been made.
*   The program does not handle the case where `r = c`, in which case the computer skips its turn.
*   The program does not calculate the result modulo 10^9+7 as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
