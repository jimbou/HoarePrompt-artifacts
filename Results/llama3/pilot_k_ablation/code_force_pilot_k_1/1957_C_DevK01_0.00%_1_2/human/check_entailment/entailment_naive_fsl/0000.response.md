Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves, considering the mirroring of moves by the computer. However, the provided program does not take into account the mirroring of moves and the constraints imposed by the already played moves.

The program only calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining empty squares, without considering the specific moves made by the player and the computer. This is not sufficient to solve the problem, as the mirroring of moves and the constraints imposed by the already played moves can significantly affect the number of possible final configurations.

For example, if the player has already placed a rook at position (r, c), the computer will mirror this move by placing a rook at position (c, r). This means that the player cannot place a rook at position (c, r) in their next move, as it would attack the computer's rook. However, the program does not take this into account, and would incorrectly count the placement of a rook at position (c, r) as a valid move.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and does not solve the problem as described.
