#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the value returned by the helper function when it is called with the integer x as an argument.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer x as input and returns the result of calling the helper function with x as an argument.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer.
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: len is a non-negative integer, and len is larger than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the element in the collection 'dp' that is equal to the current value of 'len', which is a non-negative integer larger than 0.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer, len is larger than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns variable y, but we do not have any information about the value of variable y in the initial state.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a value based on the input 'len', which is a non-negative integer. If 'len' is 0 or less, it returns 1. If 'len' is already in the collection 'dp', it returns the corresponding value from 'dp'. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the value using the 'helper' function and stores it in 'dp' before returning it. The function effectively memoizes the results of the recursive calculations in 'dp' to avoid redundant computations.
