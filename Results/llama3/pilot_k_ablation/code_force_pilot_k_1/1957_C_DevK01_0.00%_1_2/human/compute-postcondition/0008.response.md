Functionality: **This function calculates and returns a value based on the input 'len', which is a non-negative integer. If 'len' is 0 or less, it returns 1. If 'len' is already in the collection 'dp', it returns the corresponding value from 'dp'. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the value using the 'helper' function and stores it in 'dp' before returning it. The function effectively memoizes the results of the recursive calculations in 'dp' to avoid redundant computations.**
