Output State: **dp has a new key-value pair where the key is len and the value is the sum of the result of helper(len - 1) and 2 times (len - 1) times the result of helper(len - 2), len is still a non-negative integer, len is still larger than 0, and len is still not in dp before the code execution.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[len]` is calculated by adding the results of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`. The values of `len` remain unchanged, as it is still a non-negative integer larger than 0 and was not in `dp` before the code execution.
