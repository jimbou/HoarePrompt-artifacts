Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the first element `i` of the list `a` is a key in dictionary `h` with a value greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k` and `ans` is `k-1`. Otherwise, the state of `h` and `ans` remains unchanged.***
