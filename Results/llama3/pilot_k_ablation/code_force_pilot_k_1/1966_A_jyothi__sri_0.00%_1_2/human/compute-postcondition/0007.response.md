Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the first element `i` of the list `a` is already a key in dictionary `h`, then the value of `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `h` as a key with a value of 1.***
