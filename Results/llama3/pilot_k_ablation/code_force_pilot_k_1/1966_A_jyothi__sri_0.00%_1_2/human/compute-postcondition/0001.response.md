Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, h is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0**

The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `input()` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are both integers greater than 0. This line also reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.

The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The length of `a` is equal to `n`, and all elements in `a` are integers.

The third line initializes an empty dictionary `h`.

The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ans` is also an integer greater than 0.

The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
