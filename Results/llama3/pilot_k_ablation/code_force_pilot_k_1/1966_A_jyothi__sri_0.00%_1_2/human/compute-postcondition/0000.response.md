The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is an integer that is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` is an integer that is greater than 0**
