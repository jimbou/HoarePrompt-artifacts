Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is a dictionary where the first element `i` of the list `a` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` is updated to be `k-1`, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The dictionary `h` still contains the first element `i` of the list `a` as a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`.
