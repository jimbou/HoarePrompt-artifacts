Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for all integers from 1 to n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the number n itself, not the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of its digits. However, this function is only called with values of i from 0 to 12, and the results are summed up. This does not match the problem statement, which requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should iterate over all numbers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each number, and sum up these values.

Correctness: **False**
