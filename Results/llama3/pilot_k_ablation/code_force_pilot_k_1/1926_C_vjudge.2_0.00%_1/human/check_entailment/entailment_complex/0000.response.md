Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires the program to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given input n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the integer n itself, not the sum of the numbers on the board.

The program calls the function func_1(i) in a loop from 0 to 12, but it does not take into account the input n, which is the largest number Vladislav writes. The function func_1(n) correctly calculates the sum of the digits of the integer n, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

To solve the problem, the program should iterate over the numbers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each number, and add it to the total sum.

Correctness: **False**
