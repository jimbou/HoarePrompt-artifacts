Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. However, the program does not actually solve the problem as described.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`. However, the program does not use this function to solve the problem. Instead, it calls the function with values from 0 to 12 and sums up the results.

The problem statement requires the program to read the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, read an integer `n` and calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The program does not do this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
