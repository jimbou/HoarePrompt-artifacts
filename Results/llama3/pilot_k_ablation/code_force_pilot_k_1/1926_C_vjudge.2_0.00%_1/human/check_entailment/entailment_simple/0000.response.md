Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for all integers from 1 to n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the number n itself, not the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n.

The program calls the function `func_1` 13 times with arguments from 0 to 12, but it does not calculate the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n. It only calculates the sum of the digits of the number n.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should iterate over all integers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each integer, and add it to the total sum.

Correctness: **False**
