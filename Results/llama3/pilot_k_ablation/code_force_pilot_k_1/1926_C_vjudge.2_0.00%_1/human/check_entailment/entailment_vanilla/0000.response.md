Reasoning:

The provided Python program is not correct based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. The program does not read the input as described in the problem. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then read `t` integers, each representing the largest number Vladislav writes. However, the program does not have any input reading mechanism.

2. The program has a hardcoded loop that runs 13 times, which is not related to the number of test cases `t`.

3. The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of digits of a number `n`, which is correct. However, this function is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

4. The program prints the sum of the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12, which is not the desired output.

5. The program does not handle the time limit constraint of 0.5 seconds per test, which might be a problem for large inputs.

Correctness: **False**
