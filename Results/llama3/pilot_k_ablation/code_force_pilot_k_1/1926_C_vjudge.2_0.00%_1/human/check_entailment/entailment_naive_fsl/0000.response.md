Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given number n. However, the program only calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12, and then prints the sum of these values. It does not take into account the input number n.

For example, if the input is 20, the program will still only calculate the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12, and not for numbers from 1 to 20. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
