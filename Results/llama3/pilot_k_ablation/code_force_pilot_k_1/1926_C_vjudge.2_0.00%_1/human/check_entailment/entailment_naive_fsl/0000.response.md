Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n, inclusive, on the board, but the program only calculates the sum of the digits for the numbers from 0 to 12. It does not handle the case when n is greater than 12.

For example, if n = 20, the program will not calculate the sum of the digits for the numbers 13 to 20, which is not correct according to the problem description.
