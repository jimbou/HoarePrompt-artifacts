Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The program does not read the number of test cases (t) from the input, which is required according to the problem description.

2. The program does not read the input values for n, which is also required according to the problem description.

3. The program only calculates the sum of digits for numbers from 0 to 12, which is not sufficient to solve the problem for all possible inputs.

4. The program does not output the results for each test case separately, which is required according to the problem description.

5. The function func_1 is defined after it is called, which is not allowed in Python.

Correctness: **False**
