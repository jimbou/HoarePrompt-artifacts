#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of a positive integer n, where n is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of its digits. The input integer n is expected to be less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The function does not modify the input integer and returns a new value, which is the sum of the digits of the input integer.
