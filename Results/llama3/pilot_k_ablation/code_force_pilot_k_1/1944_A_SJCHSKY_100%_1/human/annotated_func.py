#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.
    if (k >= n - 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return n
        #The program returns a positive integer n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the minimum number of nodes required in a graph to have at least k edges, given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes and a non-negative integer k representing the number of edges. It returns 1 if k is greater than or equal to n-1, indicating that a single node is sufficient to have at least k edges, otherwise it returns n, indicating that all n nodes are required to have at least k edges.
