Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem statement asks to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program correctly implements the logic to solve this problem.

The function `func_1(n, k)` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of islands) and `k` (the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). The function returns the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

The logic of the function is as follows:

- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges except one. In this case, Everule can only visit one island (island 1), so the function returns 1.

- If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges. In this case, Everule can visit all islands, so the function returns `n`.

This logic is correct based on the problem statement. The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

Correctness: **True**
