Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed.

The program correctly handles the two possible cases:

1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the program correctly returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

2. If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and therefore, Everule can still visit all islands. In this case, the program correctly returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
