Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

The function `func_1(n, k)` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of islands) and `k` (the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). It returns the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

The logic is as follows:

* If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges except one, which connects island 1 to another island. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the function returns 1.
* If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges, and there will always be a path from island 1 to all other islands. Therefore, Everule can visit all islands, and the function returns `n`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
