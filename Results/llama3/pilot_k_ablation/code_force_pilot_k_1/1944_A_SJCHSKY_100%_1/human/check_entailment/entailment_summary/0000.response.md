Reasoning:
The given program is correct. The problem statement asks to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program correctly implements this by checking if the number of bridges that can be destroyed (k) is greater than or equal to the number of islands minus one (n-1). If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 (island 1 itself). If the condition is false, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and therefore Everule can visit all islands. In this case, the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit is n (all islands).

The program correctly implements this logic using the function func_1, which takes the number of islands (n) and the number of bridges that can be destroyed (k) as input and returns either 1 or n based on the condition.

Correctness: **True**
