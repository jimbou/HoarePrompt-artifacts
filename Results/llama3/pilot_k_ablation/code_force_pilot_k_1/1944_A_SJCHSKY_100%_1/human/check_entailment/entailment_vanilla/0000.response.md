Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy.

The function `func_1` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. In this case, the function returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls the `func_1` function with these values. The result is then printed.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for minimizing the number of islands that Everule can visit. If Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, then Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, Everule can visit all islands.

Correctness: **True**
