This function determines the minimum number of nodes required in a graph to have at least k edges, given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes and a non-negative integer k representing the number of edges. It returns 1 if k is greater than or equal to n-1, indicating that a single node is sufficient to have at least k edges, otherwise it returns n, indicating that all n nodes are required to have at least k edges.
