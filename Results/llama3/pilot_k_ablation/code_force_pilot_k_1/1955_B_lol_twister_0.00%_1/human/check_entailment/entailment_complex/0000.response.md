Reasoning: 

The function is correct. It correctly checks if the given list of integers can be arranged in a progressive square according to the rules specified in the problem description. The function first checks if the list is sorted and if the difference between the last and first elements is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). If not, it returns 'no'. If n is odd, it checks if the middle element of the list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. If not, it returns 'NO'. Then, it checks if the list is symmetric by comparing elements from the start and end of the list. If any pair of elements is not equal, it returns 'no'. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes'.

Correctness: **True**
