Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square based on the provided problem description. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the square `n`, and the values of `c` and `d`. It also reads the array of integers `l`.

3. The program then calls the function `func_1` with the input parameters `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`.

4. Inside the function `func_1`, it first sorts the array `l` in ascending order.

5. It then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. If not, it returns 'no'.

6. If the difference is correct, it calculates the sum of the maximum and minimum elements `a` and checks if the middle element of the array (when `n` is odd) is equal to `a // 2`. If not, it returns 'NO'.

7. It then checks if the first half of the array is a mirror image of the second half (excluding the middle element when `n` is odd). If not, it returns 'no'.

8. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

* The function `func_1` is not correctly checking if the array can be rearranged into a progressive square. It only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is correct and if the array is symmetric. But it does not check if the elements can be arranged in a square with the given values of `c` and `d`.

* The program does not handle the case when `n` is even. In this case, the middle elements of the array should be equal to `a // 2`, but the program does not check this.

* The program does not handle the case when the array contains duplicate elements. In this case, the program may return 'yes' even if the array cannot be rearranged into a progressive square.

* The program does not handle the case when the array contains elements that are not integers. In this case, the program may raise an error or return incorrect results.

* The program does not handle the case when the input values of `n`, `c`, and `d` are not valid. In this case, the program may raise an error or return incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
