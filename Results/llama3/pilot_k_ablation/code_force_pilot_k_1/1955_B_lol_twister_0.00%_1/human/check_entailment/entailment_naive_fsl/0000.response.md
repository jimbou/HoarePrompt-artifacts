Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly verify if the given array elements can form a progressive square according to the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is equal to (n-1) * (c+d), and if the middle element (if n is odd) is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum elements. However, it does not verify if the elements can be arranged in a progressive square structure.

For example, consider the input:

3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

The program will return 'NO', but it does not provide any explanation why. In fact, the elements can be arranged in a progressive square:

3 6 9
5 7 10
1 4 8

This is just one example, but there may be other cases where the program fails to correctly verify the progressive square structure.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
