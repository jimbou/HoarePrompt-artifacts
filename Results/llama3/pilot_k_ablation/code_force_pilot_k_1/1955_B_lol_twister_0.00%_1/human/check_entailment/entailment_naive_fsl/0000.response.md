Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it checks if the array elements can form a progressive square. The program only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is equal to (n-1) * (c+d), and if the middle element (if n is odd) is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum elements. However, it does not check if the elements can actually form a progressive square according to the given rules.

For example, consider the input:

3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

The program will return 'YES', but the elements cannot form a progressive square according to the given rules. The correct output should be 'NO'.

The program needs to be modified to correctly check if the elements can form a progressive square according to the given rules.
