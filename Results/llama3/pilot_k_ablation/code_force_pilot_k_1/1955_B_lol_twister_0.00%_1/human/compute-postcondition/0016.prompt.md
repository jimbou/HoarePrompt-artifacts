You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l.
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns the string 'no'.
    #State: *The list `l` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`, `c` and `d` are integers such that `1 <= c, d <= 10^6`. The difference between the last and first elements of `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns the string 'NO'
        #State: *l is a sorted list in ascending order, n is an odd integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of l is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is n^2 divided by 2, and the element at index r in list l is not equal to half of a
    #State: *l is a sorted list in ascending order, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of l is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is n^2 divided by 2. If n is odd, the element at index r in list l is not equal to half of a.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: `l` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 divided by 2, and for all k in range(r), the kth element of `l` is equal to the (-k-1)th element of `l`. If the loop executes, then the function will not return 'no'. If the loop does not execute, then n is 2 and the first and last elements of `l` are equal.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns the string 'yes'

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'no'.

Case_2: *l is a sorted list in ascending order, n is an odd integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of l is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is n^2 divided by 2, and the element at index r in list l is not equal to half of a

Case_3: `l` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 divided by 2, and for all k in range(r), the kth element of `l` is equal to the (-k-1)th element of `l`. If the loop executes, then the function will not return 'no'. If the loop does not execute, then n is 2 and the first and last elements of `l` are equal.

Case_4: The program returns the string 'yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
