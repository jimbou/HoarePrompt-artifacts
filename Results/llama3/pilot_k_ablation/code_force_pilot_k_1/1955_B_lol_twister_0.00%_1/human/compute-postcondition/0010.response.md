The only variable in the loop head is variable `k` and `r`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r`. If `r` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `r` is `n^2` divided by 2, which is at least 1 because `n` is greater than or equal to 2. So `r` must be at least 1 and `k` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, and the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 0**
