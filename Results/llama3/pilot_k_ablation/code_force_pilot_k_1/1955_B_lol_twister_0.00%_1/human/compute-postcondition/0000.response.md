Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1**.

In this output state, the list `l` has been sorted in ascending order, meaning that the smallest integer in the list is now at the beginning of the list, and the largest integer is at the end. The values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the sorting operation.
