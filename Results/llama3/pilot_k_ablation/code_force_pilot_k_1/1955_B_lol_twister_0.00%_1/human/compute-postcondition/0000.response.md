The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The list `l` contains `n^2` integers, where `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`. The integers in the list are such that `1 <= b_i <= 10^9` for all `b_i` in `l`.

After the code is executed, the list `l` is sorted in ascending order. The values of the other variables, `n`, `c`, and `d`, are not affected.

Output State: **The list `l` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`, `c` and `d` are integers such that `1 <= c, d <= 10^6`.**
