Postcondition: **l is a sorted list in ascending order, n is an odd integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of l is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is n^2 divided by 2.**
