Functionality: **This function determines whether a given list of integers represents a valid sequence of numbers that can be arranged in a specific pattern. It takes four parameters: an integer n, integers c and d, and a list l of n^2 integers. The function first checks if the list is sorted and if the difference between the last and first elements is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). If not, it returns 'no'. If n is odd, it checks if the middle element of the list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. If not, it returns 'NO'. Then, it checks if the list is symmetric by comparing elements from the start and end of the list. If any pair of elements is not equal, it returns 'no'. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes'.**
