Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is at least 1, `k` is 0, and the kth element of `l` is equal to the (-k-1)th element of `l`***
