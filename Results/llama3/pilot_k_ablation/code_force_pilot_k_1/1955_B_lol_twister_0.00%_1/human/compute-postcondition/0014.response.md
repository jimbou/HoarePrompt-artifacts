Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers greater than or equal to 1, and the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the loop either returns 'no' or finishes without returning, in which case `l` is a palindrome (i.e., `l[k] == l[-1 - k]` for all `k` in range `r`).**
