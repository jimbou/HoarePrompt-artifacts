Output State: **`l` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 divided by 2, and for all k in range(r), the kth element of `l` is equal to the (-k-1)th element of `l`. If the loop executes, then the function will not return 'no'. If the loop does not execute, then n is 2 and the first and last elements of `l` are equal.**
