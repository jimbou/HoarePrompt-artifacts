The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, and `b` is `min(n, m)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **sum of n // b + 1 for all b from 1 to min(n, m) (where n and m are positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6)**
