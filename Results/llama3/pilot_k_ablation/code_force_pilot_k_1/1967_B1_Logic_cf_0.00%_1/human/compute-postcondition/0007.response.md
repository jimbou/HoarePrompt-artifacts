The code prints the value of `ans` which is the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), and `b` is `min(n, m)`.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)` which is equal to `ans` is being printed**
