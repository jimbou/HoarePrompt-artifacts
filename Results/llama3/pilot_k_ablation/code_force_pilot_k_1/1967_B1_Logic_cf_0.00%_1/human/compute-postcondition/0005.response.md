The code `ans = ans + n // b + 1` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `n // b + 1` to its current value.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, and `b` is 1, the expression `n // b` evaluates to `n` itself (because `n` divided by 1 is `n`). Therefore, the expression `n // b + 1` evaluates to `n + 1`.

The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value, which is 0. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `0 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 1`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `T`, `stdin`, `m`, and `b`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `ans` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1**
