Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each test case containing two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The values of n and m are not affected by this code snippet.
