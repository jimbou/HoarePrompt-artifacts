Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), we can conclude that `t` will be assigned a value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The input is consumed by the `input()` function, so the stdin will no longer contain the first line of the input.

The output state is:

**`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line removed)**

Note that the remaining test cases in the stdin are still present, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
