To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 1.

Since `n` and `m` are already defined as positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6, we can conclude that `min(n, m)` will always be at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute.

However, to make the state more explicit, we can adjust the state of `b` to be 1, since it will start from 1 in the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `ans` is 0, `b` is 1**
