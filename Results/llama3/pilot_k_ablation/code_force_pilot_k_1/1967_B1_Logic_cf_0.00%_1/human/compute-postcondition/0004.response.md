Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` must be at least 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the integer division of `n` by `b` (which is 1) plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the previous value of `ans` plus `n` plus 1. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
