To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` must be at least 1**
