Output State: **t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, ans is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `T` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one because the first line of the code reads two positive integers from stdin, effectively removing one test case from the input. The values of `n` and `m` are now positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6, as they are assigned the values of the two positive integers read from stdin. The value of `ans` is 0, as it is initialized to 0 in the code.
