Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m. It calculates the sum of the integer division of n by all numbers from 1 to the minimum of n and m, adds 1 to each result, and then prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
