Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is `t`, `stdin` is empty, `n` and `m` are the last two positive integers read from `stdin`, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)` has been printed for all test cases.**
