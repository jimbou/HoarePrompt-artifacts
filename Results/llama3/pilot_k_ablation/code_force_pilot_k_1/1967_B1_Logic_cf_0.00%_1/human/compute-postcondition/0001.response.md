Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first line of the input, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers n and m, each between 1 and 2 * 10^6.
