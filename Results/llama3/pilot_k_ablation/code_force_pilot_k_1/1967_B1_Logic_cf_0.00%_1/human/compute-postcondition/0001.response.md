To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `T` to ensure it starts from the correct value.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
