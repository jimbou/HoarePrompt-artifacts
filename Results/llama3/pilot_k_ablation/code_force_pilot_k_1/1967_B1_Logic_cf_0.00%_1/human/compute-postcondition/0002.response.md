According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust `T` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
