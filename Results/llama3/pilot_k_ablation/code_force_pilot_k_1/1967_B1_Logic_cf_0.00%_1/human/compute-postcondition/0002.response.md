The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The second line converts the values of `n` and `m` to integers. The third line initializes `ans` to 0.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), T is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
