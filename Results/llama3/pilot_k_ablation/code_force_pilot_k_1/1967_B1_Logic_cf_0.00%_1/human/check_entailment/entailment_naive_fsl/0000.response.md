Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description. The condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) is not being checked. The program is simply counting the number of pairs (a, b) where a and b are less than or equal to n and m respectively, and b is a divisor of n. This is not the correct interpretation of the problem.

For example, for the input n = 10, m = 8, the program will output 14, but the correct output should be 13, because the pair (10, 8) does not satisfy the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) is satisfied. We can use the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

This program correctly checks all possible pairs (a, b) and counts the number of pairs that satisfy the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).
