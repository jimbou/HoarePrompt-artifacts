Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description. The condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) is not being checked. The program is simply counting the number of pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, without considering the additional condition.

For example, for the input n = 2, m = 3, the program will output 3, but the correct output should be 3, because the pairs (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2) satisfy the conditions. However, the program is not correctly checking the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) is satisfied. If it is, then the pair should be counted. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected program will correctly count the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.
