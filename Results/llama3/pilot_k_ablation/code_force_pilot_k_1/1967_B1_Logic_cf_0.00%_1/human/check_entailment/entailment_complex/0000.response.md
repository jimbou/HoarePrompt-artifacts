Reasoning:

The given Python program is incorrect. The program is trying to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

However, the program is simply calculating the sum of n // b + 1 for all b from 1 to the minimum of n and m, which is not the correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of a and b, and checking if the conditions are satisfied. The program does not do this, and therefore it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
