Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires the calculation of the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program calculates the sum of n // b + 1 for all b from 1 to the minimum of n and m, which does not accurately represent the number of valid pairs.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of a and b within the given ranges and checking if the conditions are satisfied. The program does not perform this check and instead calculates an incorrect sum.

Correctness: **False**
