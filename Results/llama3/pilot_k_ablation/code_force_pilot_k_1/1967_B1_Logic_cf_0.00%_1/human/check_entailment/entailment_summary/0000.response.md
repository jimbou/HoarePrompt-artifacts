Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is attempting to solve the problem by summing up the integer division of `n` by all numbers from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, adding 1 to each result. However, this approach is not correct.

The problem statement requires that `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`. The program does not take into account the `gcd(a,b)` part of the condition. It simply calculates the sum of the integer division of `n` by all numbers from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, which is not sufficient to satisfy the given condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
