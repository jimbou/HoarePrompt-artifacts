Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) is not properly checked. The program simply adds n // b + 1 for all b from 1 to min(n, m), which does not guarantee that a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b). The program does not consider the relationship between a and b, and it does not calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.

Correctness: **False**
