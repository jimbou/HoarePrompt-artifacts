The function reads pairs of integers (n, k) from standard input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3, and prints a list of integers for each pair. If k is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of n elements, each equal to n, if n equals k; otherwise, it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 0 to n-1. The function continues this process until all pairs have been read from standard input, at which point the file object is closed and standard input is empty.
