The code prints the elements of a list generated by a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and includes each number `j` in the list.

Since `n` is an integer, the list will contain `n` elements, each of which is an integer from 0 to `n-1`.

The `*` operator is used to unpack the list and print its elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`, separated by spaces.

Output: **0 1 2 ... n-1 (where n is the value of the variable n)**
