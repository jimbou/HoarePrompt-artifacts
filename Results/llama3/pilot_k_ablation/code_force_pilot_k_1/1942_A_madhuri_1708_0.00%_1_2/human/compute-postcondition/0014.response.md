Output State: **stdin is empty, `n` and `k` are the last pair of integers read from stdin, and the file object is closed. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 for all pairs, then if `n` equals `k` for all pairs, a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`, is printed for each pair; otherwise, -1 is printed for each pair. If `k` is less than 2 for any pair, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is printed for that pair.**
