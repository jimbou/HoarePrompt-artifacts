The code prints the value of `k` repeated `k` times, where `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and is equal to the value of `n`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `k` repeated `k` times.

Output: **k (where k is the value of k, repeated k times)**
