To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the file object `open(0)` and the variable `s`. The loop will iterate over the lines in the file object, starting from the second line (`[1:]`).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object having at least two lines. The first line contains the integer `t`, and the subsequent lines contain the pairs of integers `n` and `k`.

To adjust the states, we need to ensure that the file object has at least two lines, and the first line contains a valid integer `t`. We can't adjust the values of `n` and `k` as they are not in the loop head.

State: **stdin contains at least two lines, the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), and the file object is open and readable**
