The code prints a list of `k` elements, where each element is equal to `k`. Since the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, the list will contain `n` elements, each equal to `n`.

Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and its current value is greater than or equal to 2, stdin contains at least one line, the file object is open and readable. The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, and this is printed: a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`.**
