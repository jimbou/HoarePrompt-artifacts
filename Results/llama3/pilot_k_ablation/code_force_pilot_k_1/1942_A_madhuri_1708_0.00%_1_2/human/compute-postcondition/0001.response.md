Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one line, the file object is open and readable**

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of the input, which is split into two parts using the `split()` method. The file object remains open and readable, and stdin still contains at least one line after reading the first line.
