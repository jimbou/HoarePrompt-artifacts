Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line, and the file object is open and readable. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`, is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is printed.***
