Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program reads pairs of integers (n, k) from standard input and prints a list of integers for each pair.

If k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n equals k. If they are equal, it prints a list of n elements, each equal to n. This is because when n equals k, the only way to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts is to have all elements equal, which results in all cyclic shifts being sorted. If n does not equal k, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array.

If k is less than 2, the program prints a list of integers from 0 to n-1. This is because when k is 1, we can have a single sorted cyclic shift by having the elements in increasing order, and the remaining cyclic shifts will not be sorted.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
