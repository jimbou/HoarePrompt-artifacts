Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`. This is because when `n` equals `k`, the only possible array `a` that satisfies the condition is an array of all identical elements, which has `n` sorted cyclic shifts.

If `n` does not equal `k` and `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the condition.

If `k` is less than 2, the program prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. This is because when `k` is 1, the array `a` can be any non-decreasing sequence of distinct integers, which has exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
