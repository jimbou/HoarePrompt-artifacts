Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints the numbers from 0 to n-1, but this does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "0 1 2", but the cyclic shifts of this array are [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], and [2, 0, 1], and only one of them is sorted.

The correct solution should print an array that has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the correct solution should print an array like [1, 2, 3] or [3, 1, 2], which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
