Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly handles the case when `k` is greater than or equal to 2. In this case, it checks if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`. This is a valid solution because a list of identical elements is sorted, and there are `n` cyclic shifts of this list, all of which are sorted. If `n` does not equal `k`, it prints -1, which is also correct because there is no valid solution in this case.
* The program correctly handles the case when `k` is less than 2. In this case, it prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. This is a valid solution because there is only one cyclic shift of this list that is sorted (the original list itself), and `k` is 1.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
