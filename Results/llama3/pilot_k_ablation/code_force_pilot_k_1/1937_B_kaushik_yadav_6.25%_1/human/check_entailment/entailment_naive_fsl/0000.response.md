Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not the one that can be attained by always choosing the smaller character. For example, when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The program will output:

010
1

However, the correct output should be:

001
2

Because the lexicographically smallest string that can be attained is "001" and there are two paths that yield this string.

The program's logic is flawed because it assumes that the lexicographically smallest string can always be attained by always choosing the smaller character. However, this is not always the case. The program needs to be modified to correctly handle this scenario.
