To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
