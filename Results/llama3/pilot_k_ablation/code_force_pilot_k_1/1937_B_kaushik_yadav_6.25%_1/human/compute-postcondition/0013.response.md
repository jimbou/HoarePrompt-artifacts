Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, `i` is either 0 if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, `work` is True, stdin contains `t-3` inputs. Either `i` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i-1]` is not less than `a[i]` if `i` is 1, or `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` if `i` is 0. The length of `a` is more than `i` if `i` is 0.***
