Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, stdin contains `t-3` inputs. Either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The length of `a` is more than `i + 1`***
