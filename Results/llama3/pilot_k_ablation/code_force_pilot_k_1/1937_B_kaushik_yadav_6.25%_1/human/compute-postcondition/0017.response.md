Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is either True or False, stdin contains `t-3` inputs. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that contains the first character of `a`, and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, and `i` is either 0 if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, and `work` is True. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.***
