Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is one character longer than its original length, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `work` is True, then `ans` starts with the first character of `a`, and either `i` is 1 and `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, then `ans` ends with the last character of `b` and `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. Otherwise, if `work` is False, then `i` is 1 and `work` is False.***
