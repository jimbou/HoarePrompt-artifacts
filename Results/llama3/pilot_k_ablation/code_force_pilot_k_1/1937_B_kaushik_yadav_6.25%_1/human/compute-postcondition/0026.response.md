Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is either a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` if `work` is True and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, or just `b` if `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains `t-3` inputs, `j` is 0, and the string `ans` is either a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` if `work` is True and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, or just `b` if `work` is False. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2, otherwise `counter` remains 1. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is '0' and the current value of `b[j]` is '1'.**
