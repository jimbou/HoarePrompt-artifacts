Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, stdin contains `t-3` inputs. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1 and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `a`.**
