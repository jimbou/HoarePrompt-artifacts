Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is either a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` if `work` is True and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, or just `b` if `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` inputs, `j` is 0, and the string `ans` is either a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` if `work` is True and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, or just `b` if `work` is False. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The string `ans` is still a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` if `work` is True and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, or just `b` if `work` is False. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is still equal to the current value of `b[j]`.
