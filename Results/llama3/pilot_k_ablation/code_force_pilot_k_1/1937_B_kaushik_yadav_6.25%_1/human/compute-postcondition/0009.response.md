Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `work` is True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. Either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The current value of `i` is equal to the length of `a`.**
