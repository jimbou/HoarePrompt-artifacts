Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of length n and an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) for each test case, t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, input is a function that reads a line from stdin.**

The first line assigns the function `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string. The second line reads an integer from standard input using the `input` function and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The state of `stdin` is modified as it now contains one less line, which was read and assigned to `t`. The state of `t` is updated to the number of test cases. The state of `input` is updated to the `sys.stdin.readline` function.
