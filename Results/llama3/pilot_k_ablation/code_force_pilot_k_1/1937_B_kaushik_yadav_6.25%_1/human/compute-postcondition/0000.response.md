Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length equal to the integer.**

The first line imports the readline function from the sys module, allowing for more efficient input reading. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable t. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs each: an integer and two binary strings of the same length equal to the integer.
