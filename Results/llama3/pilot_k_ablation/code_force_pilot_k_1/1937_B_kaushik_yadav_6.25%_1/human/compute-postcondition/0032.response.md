Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is either a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` if `work` is True and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, or just `b` if `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1 plus the number of times `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` minus the number of times `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', stdin is empty, and `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1.**
