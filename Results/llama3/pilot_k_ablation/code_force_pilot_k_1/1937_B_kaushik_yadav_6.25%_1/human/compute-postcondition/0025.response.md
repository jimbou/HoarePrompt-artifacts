Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string that has a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is equal to the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `j` is 0. If the current value of `a` at index `j + 1` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `j`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1.***
