Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then processes each test case by combining the two binary strings into a single string, `ans`, based on certain conditions. The function prints the combined string `ans` and a counter value, which is calculated by comparing the characters of the two input strings. The function repeats this process for all test cases until standard input is empty.**
