Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, stdin contains `t-3` inputs. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that contains all characters of `a` and the last character of `b` if the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string that contains all characters of `b`.**
