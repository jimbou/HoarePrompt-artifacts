Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is equal to the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, then `ans` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string that starts with a prefix of `a` and ends with a suffix of `b`.**
