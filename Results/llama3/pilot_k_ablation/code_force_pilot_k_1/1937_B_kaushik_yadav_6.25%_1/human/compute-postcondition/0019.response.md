Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the value of `ans`.

If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that contains all characters of `a` and the last character of `b` if the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. This means that `ans` will be a string that is a combination of the characters in `a` and the last character of `b`, but only if `a` and `b` have the same length.

If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string that contains all characters of `b`. This means that `ans` will be a string that is identical to `b`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `work` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string `ans`, which is either a combination of `a` and the last character of `b` (if `work` is True and `a` and `b` have the same length), or the string `b` (if `work` is False).

Output: **ans (where ans is either a combination of a and the last character of b if work is True and a and b have the same length, or the string b if work is False)**
