Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a non-empty string, b is a string, ans is a string that is one character longer than its original length, i is 1, work is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the end of string `ans`. Since `i` is initially 0, this operation adds the first character of `b` to `ans`. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 1. 

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `a` remains a non-empty string, `b` remains a string, `work` remains False, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
