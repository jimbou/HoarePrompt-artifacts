Reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. The input consists of an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). The function sorts each test case, calculates the sum of the indices of equal adjacent elements, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list. If there are no test cases (t = 0), the function does not print anything.
