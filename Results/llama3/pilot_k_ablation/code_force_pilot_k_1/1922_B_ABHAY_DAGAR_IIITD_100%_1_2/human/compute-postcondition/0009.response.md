Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `current_index` is current_index + n, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings representing the input data, `input` is a function that reads from sys.stdin, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[i]: 0}, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at the current_index in the data list, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `hashing` dictionary now contains a key-value pair where the key is the value of `a[i]` (which is the integer value of the string at the current index in the data list) and the value is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
