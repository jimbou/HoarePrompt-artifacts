To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already given as an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **stdin is empty, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and must be greater than 0, current_index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings representing the input data, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin**
