The code `results.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the `results` list. The value of `ans` is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1]. The hashing dictionary contains the key-value pair {a[i]: sum of indices of a[i] in the list a} for all i.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `current_index` is current_index + n, `results` is a list containing the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1], `data` is a list of strings representing the input data, `input` is a function that reads from sys.stdin, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list and must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at the current_index in the data list, `i` is n-1, `ans` is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1], hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[i]: sum of indices of a[i] in the list a} for all i.**
