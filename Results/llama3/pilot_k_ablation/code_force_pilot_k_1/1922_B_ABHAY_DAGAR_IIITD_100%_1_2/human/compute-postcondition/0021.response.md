The code prints the first element in the results list which is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for some iteration.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `current_index` is `1 + sum of all n`, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element which is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for some iteration, `data` is a list of strings representing the input data, `input` is a function that reads from sys.stdin, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list for the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at the current_index in the data list for the last iteration, `i` is the last value of n-1, `ans` is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for the last iteration, hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[i]: sum of indices of a[i] in the list a} for all i for the last iteration, `result` is the first element in the results list, and result is printed, result (where result is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for some iteration)**
