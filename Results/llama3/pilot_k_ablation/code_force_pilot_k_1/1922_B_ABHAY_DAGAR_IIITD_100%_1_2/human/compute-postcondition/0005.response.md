Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and must be greater than 0, current_index is current_index + n, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings representing the input data, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list and must be greater than 0, a is a list containing the integer values of the strings at the current_index in the data list, i is n-1. If n is 0 then the loop does not execute and the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.**
