Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and must be greater than 0, current_index is 3, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings representing the input data, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list and must be greater than 0, a is a list containing the integer value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list, i is 0**

The code block modifies the current_index and a. The first line appends the integer value of the string at the current_index in the data list to a. The second line increments the current_index by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
