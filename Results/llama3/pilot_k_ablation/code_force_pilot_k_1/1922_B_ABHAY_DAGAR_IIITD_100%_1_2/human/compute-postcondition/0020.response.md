The code prints the first element in the `results` list.
The `results` list contains at least 1 element which is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for some iteration.
Since the exact `results` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the first element in the `results` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element in the `results` list.
Output: **the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for some iteration (where hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[i]: sum of indices of a[i] in the list a} for all i)**
