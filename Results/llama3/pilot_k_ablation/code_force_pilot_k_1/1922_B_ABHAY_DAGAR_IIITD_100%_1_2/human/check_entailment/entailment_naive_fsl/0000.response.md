Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for the case where two sticks have the same length, but it does not consider the case where three sticks have the same length.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 35, because any three sticks out of the seven can be chosen to form a triangle.

The program should be modified to correctly handle the case where three sticks have the same length. One possible solution is to use a combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks out of the total number of sticks with the same length.
