Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `current_index` is `1 + sum of all n`, `results` is a list containing the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for each iteration, `data` is a list of strings representing the input data, `input` is a function that reads from sys.stdin, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list for the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at the current_index in the data list for the last iteration, `i` is the last value of n-1, `ans` is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for the last iteration, hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[i]: sum of indices of a[i] in the list a} for all i for the last iteration. If t is 0, then current_index is 1, results is an empty list, and the other variables remain unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `current_index` is `1 + sum of all n`, `results` is a list containing the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for each iteration, `data` is a list of strings representing the input data, `input` is a function that reads from sys.stdin, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the string at the previous current_index in the data list for the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the strings at the current_index in the data list for the last iteration, `i` is the last value of n-1, `ans` is the sum of hashing[a[i]] for all i where a[i] is equal to a[i + 1] for the last iteration, hashing is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {a[i]: sum of indices of a[i] in the list a} for all i for the last iteration, all elements in the results list have been printed. If t is 0, then current_index is 1, results is an empty list, and the other variables remain unchanged. If results is an empty list, then no elements have been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. The input consists of an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). The function sorts each test case, calculates the sum of the indices of equal adjacent elements, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list. If there are no test cases (t = 0), the function does not print anything.
