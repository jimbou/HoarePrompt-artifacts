#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers (cur_arr), an integer (bit) between -1 and 30, and a non-negative integer (x) less than 2^30 as input. It performs bitwise XOR operations on the elements of cur_arr based on the value of bit and x, and returns either the number of non-negative integers in cur_arr, the maximum value between the number of elements in a new array (new_arr) and the result of a recursive function call (find_new), the result of a recursive function call (find_new) with new_arr and bit-1 as arguments, or -1. The function's purpose is to find the maximum value based on the bitwise XOR operations and the recursive function calls, and it affects the input variables by modifying the list cur_arr and the integer bit.
