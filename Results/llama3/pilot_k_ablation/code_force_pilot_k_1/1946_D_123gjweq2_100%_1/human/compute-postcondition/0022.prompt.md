You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of elements in the list 'cur_arr' which contains non-negative integers.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between `thing1` and the result of the function `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr` because the current value of `x` has a 1 at the bit position `bit`, which means the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, so `xor` remains the same and `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`. The result of the function `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is a value that is compared with `thing1` to determine the maximum value.

Case_3: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) if the bit at position `bit` in the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, `xor` remains the same and `thing1` is -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` remains 0 and `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0. `thing1` is -1.

Case_4: The program returns -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
