Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers, an integer bit, and a non-negative integer x as input. It performs a series of bitwise XOR operations on the list elements and groups them based on the bit at a specific position. The function then recursively calls itself with the grouped elements and the next bit position. The function returns the maximum number of elements in the grouped lists or -1 if no groups are formed. The function also handles edge cases where the bit is -1, in which case it returns the length of the input list.**
