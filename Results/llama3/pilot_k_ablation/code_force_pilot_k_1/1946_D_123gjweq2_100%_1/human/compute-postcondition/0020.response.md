Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the elements in `cur_arr` that do not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and all elements in `cur_arr`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, and `thing1` is -1.***
