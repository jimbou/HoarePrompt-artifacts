Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that is not empty, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the first element in the list `cur_arr` (i), `xor` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list.**

The code first appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the first element in the list `cur_arr` (i), `new_arr` now contains this value. Then, `xor` is reset to 0. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code.
