Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in cur_arr, xor is 0, i is the first element in cur_arr.**

The code first appends the value of `xor` to `new_arr`, which means `new_arr` now contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`. Then, it assigns 0 to `xor`, effectively resetting its value. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
