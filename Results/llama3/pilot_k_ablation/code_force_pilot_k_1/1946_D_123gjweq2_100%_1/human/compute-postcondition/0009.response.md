Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the elements in `cur_arr` that do not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, `xor` is 0 if the last element in `cur_arr` does not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, otherwise `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and all elements in `cur_arr`.**
