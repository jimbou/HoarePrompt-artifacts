According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, and `xor` is 0. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state of `cur_arr` to have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`**
