The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cur_arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur_arr`. If cur_arr is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `cur_arr` is not empty and i is now the first element in the list.
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that is not empty, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list**
