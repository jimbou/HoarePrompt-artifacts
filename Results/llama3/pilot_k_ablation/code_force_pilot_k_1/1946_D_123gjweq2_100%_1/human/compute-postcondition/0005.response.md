Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` remains unchanged, the integer `bit` and the non-negative integer `x` also remain unchanged. The empty list `new_arr` is still empty. The variable `xor` now holds the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`. The variable `i` is still the first element in `cur_arr`.
