Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that is not empty, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the first element in the list `cur_arr` (i), `i` is the first element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` remains unchanged, the integer `bit` is still between 0 and 30, the non-negative integer `x` is still less than 2^30, the list `new_arr` is still empty, the value of `xor` has been updated to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in the list `cur_arr`, and the value of `i` is still the first element in the list.
