Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`. The current value of `xor` shifted right by `bit` places has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 (i.e., the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0).**
