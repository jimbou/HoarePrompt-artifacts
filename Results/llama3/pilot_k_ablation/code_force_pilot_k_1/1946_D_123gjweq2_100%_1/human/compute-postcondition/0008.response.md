Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that is not empty, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the first element in the list `cur_arr` (i) if the bit at position `bit` in the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the first element in the list `cur_arr` (i) is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list***
