Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`. If the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr` shifted right by `bit` and then bitwise AND with 1 is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.***
