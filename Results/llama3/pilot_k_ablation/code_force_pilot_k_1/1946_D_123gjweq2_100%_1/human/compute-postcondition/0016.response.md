Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between thing1 and the result of the function find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1). thing1 is either -1 or the number of elements in new_arr, where new_arr is a list of integers resulting from the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the elements in cur_arr that do not have the bit at position bit set to 1. The result of find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1) is not specified, but it is compared to thing1 to determine the maximum value.**
