Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `thing1` and the result of the function `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr` because the current value of `x` has a 1 at the bit position `bit`, which means the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, so `xor` remains the same and `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`. The result of the function `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is a value that is compared with `thing1` to determine the maximum value.**
