Output State: **The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with the list `new_arr` and the integer `bit - 1` as arguments.**

In this output state, `new_arr` is a list of the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) if the bit at position `bit` in the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) is 0. The integer `bit - 1` is the new value of `bit` decremented by 1.
