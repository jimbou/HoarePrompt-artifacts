Output State: **The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with the list `new_arr` and the integer `bit - 1` as arguments. `new_arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the elements in `cur_arr` that do not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1. `bit - 1` is an integer such that -1 <= bit - 1 <= 29. The current value of `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`.**
