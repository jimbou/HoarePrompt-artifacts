Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) if the bit at position `bit` in the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) is 0, `xor` is a value such that the bit at position `bit` is 1, `thing1` is -1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `thing1` which is assigned the value -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
