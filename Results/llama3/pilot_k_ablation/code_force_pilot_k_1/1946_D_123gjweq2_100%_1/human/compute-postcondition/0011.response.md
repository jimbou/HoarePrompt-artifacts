Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the elements in `cur_arr` that do not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and all elements in `cur_arr`, and the current value of `xor` has the bit at position `bit` set to 1, and `thing1` is -1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `thing1` that is assigned the value -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
