Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) if the bit at position `bit` in the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` (0) and the elements in the list `cur_arr` (i) is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, `xor` remains the same and `thing1` is -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` remains 0 and `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0.***
