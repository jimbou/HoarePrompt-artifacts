To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code and its impact on the initial state.

The code is: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`

From the initial state, we know that `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 3.

Now, let's calculate the value of `dp[i]`:

`dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`
`dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`
`dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`
`dp[3] = (3 + 4) % 1000000007`
`dp[3] = 7 % 1000000007`
`dp[3] = 7`

So, the value of `dp[3]` is 7.

The values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
