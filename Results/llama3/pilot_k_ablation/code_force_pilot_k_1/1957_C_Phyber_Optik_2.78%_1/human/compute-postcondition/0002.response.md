The value of dp[i] is calculated using the formula (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. Here, i is 3, dp[1] is 1, and dp[2] is 3. Substituting these values, we get dp[3] = (1 + 2 * 2 * 3) % 1000000007 = (1 + 12) % 1000000007 = 13 % 1000000007 = 13.

The value of n is at least 3, but it does not affect the calculation of dp[i]. The value of i is 3, which is used in the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 13**
