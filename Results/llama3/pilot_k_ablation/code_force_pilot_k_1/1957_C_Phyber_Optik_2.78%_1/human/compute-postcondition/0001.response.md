To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3. Since `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3, we can infer that `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
