Output State: **n is a positive integer, dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a specific index in the `dp` list. The first line sets `dp[1]` to 1, and the second line sets `dp[2]` to 3. These assignments do not affect the value of `n`, which remains a positive integer. The `dp` list now has values at indices 1 and 2, but the value of `n` is unchanged.
