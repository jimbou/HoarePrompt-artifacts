Functionality: This function calculates and stores the values of a recurrence relation in the list `dp` for indices 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i` in the range 3 to `n` (inclusive), with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function modifies the `dp` list in-place, leaving it populated with the calculated values.
