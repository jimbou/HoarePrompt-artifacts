Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for a given board size n. The recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007 is used to calculate the number of possible configurations for a board of size i, based on the number of configurations for boards of size i-1 and i-2.

The program first initializes the dp array with -1, and then calls the function func_1(300000) to calculate the dp values for board sizes up to 300000. The function func_1 is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to correctly calculate the dp values using the recurrence relation.

After calculating the dp values, the program reads the input for each test case, which includes the board size n and the number of moves k. It then reads the k moves and stores the rows and columns of the moves in a set called invalid.

Finally, the program prints the number of possible final configurations for the given board size n and number of moves k, which is stored in dp[n - len(invalid)]. This is correct because the number of possible final configurations is equal to the number of configurations for a board of size n - len(invalid), where len(invalid) is the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

Correctness: **True**
