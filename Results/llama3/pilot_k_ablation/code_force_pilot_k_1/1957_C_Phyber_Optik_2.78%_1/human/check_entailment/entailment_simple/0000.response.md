Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for a given board size `n`. The recurrence relation is correctly implemented, and the base cases are properly handled.

The program first initializes the `dp` array with -1, indicating that the values have not been computed yet. Then, it calls the `func_1` function with the argument `300000`, which computes the values of `dp` for `n` ranging from 1 to 300000 using the recurrence relation.

The recurrence relation is based on the fact that for a board of size `n`, the number of possible final configurations is the sum of two cases:

1. The first case is when the first move is made in a row or column that has not been used before. In this case, the number of possible final configurations is `dp[n - 1]`, since the remaining `n - 1` rows and columns can be used to make the remaining moves.
2. The second case is when the first move is made in a row or column that has been used before. In this case, the number of possible final configurations is `2 * (n - 1) * dp[n - 2]`, since there are `n - 1` ways to choose the row or column for the first move, and for each of these choices, there are `dp[n - 2]` ways to make the remaining moves.

The program then reads the input for each test case, which consists of the board size `n` and the number of moves `k` that have already been made. It uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that have already been used, and then prints the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n - len(invalid)` rows and columns.

Correctness: **True**
