Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The program correctly calculates this by using a dynamic programming approach.

2. The dynamic programming approach is based on the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, which is correct. This relation is derived from the fact that for each new row, we have two options: either place a rook in the same column as the previous row, or place a rook in a different column. If we place a rook in the same column, we have dp[i - 1] possibilities. If we place a rook in a different column, we have 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] possibilities, because we can choose any of the i - 1 columns that are not the same as the previous column, and for each of these columns, we have dp[i - 2] possibilities.

3. The program correctly initializes the base cases dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

4. The program correctly calculates the number of invalid moves by adding the rows and columns of the k moves to a set, and then subtracting the size of this set from n to get the number of valid moves.

5. The program correctly prints the result by looking up the value in the dp array corresponding to the number of valid moves.

Correctness: **True**
