Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The program correctly calculates this by using dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems in the dp array.

2. The recurrence relation used in the program is correct. It is based on the fact that for each new move, we have two options: either place a white rook at position (r, c) and a black rook at position (c, r), or place a white rook at position (r, r) and skip the computer's turn. The recurrence relation correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for each new move.

3. The program correctly handles the base cases. The base cases are when n is 1 or 2, and the program correctly initializes dp[1] and dp[2] with the correct values.

4. The program correctly calculates the final result. After calculating the dp array, the program prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which is the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves.

5. The program correctly handles the modulo operation. The program correctly calculates the result modulo 10^9+7 to avoid overflow.

Correctness: **True**
