Reasoning:  
The problem asks to determine the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program provided uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each size of the chessboard from 1 to n.

The dynamic programming approach is based on the fact that for a chessboard of size i, the number of possible configurations can be calculated using the number of possible configurations for chessboards of size i-1 and i-2. This is because a move on a chessboard of size i can be either a move on a chessboard of size i-1 (with an additional row and column) or a move on a chessboard of size i-2 (with two additional rows and columns).

The base cases for the dynamic programming are dp[1] = 1 (only one possible configuration for a 1x1 chessboard) and dp[2] = 3 (three possible configurations for a 2x2 chessboard).

The recurrence relation is dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % 1000000007, which calculates the number of possible configurations for a chessboard of size i.

The program then reads the input, calculates the number of invalid moves (moves that have already been made), and prints the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid moves.

Correctness: **True**
