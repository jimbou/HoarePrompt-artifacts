Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The given program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

The dynamic programming approach is based on the fact that the number of different final configurations possible after k moves is dependent on the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions that have a rook in the same row or column as an existing rook).

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size 300007, where dp[i] represents the number of different final configurations possible when there are i invalid positions.

The function func_1(n) is used to fill up the dp array. It starts by initializing dp[1] and dp[2] to 1 and 3, respectively. Then, it uses a loop to fill up the rest of the dp array. For each i from 3 to n, it calculates dp[i] as (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k pairs of integers r and c, which represent the moves made so far.

For each test case, the program calculates the number of invalid positions by adding the rows and columns of the moves made so far to a set. It then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)] as the answer.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + k), where n is the size of the chessboard and k is the number of moves made so far. The space complexity is O(n), which is used to store the dp array.

Correctness: **True**
