Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of counting the number of different final configurations in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The game starts with an n x n chessboard, and the player and the computer take turns placing rooks on the board, with the computer mirroring the player's moves. The goal is to count the number of different final configurations that can be reached after k moves.

The program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a dp array of size 300007, where dp[i] represents the number of different final configurations that can be reached with i moves. The function func_1 calculates the values of dp[i] for i from 1 to 300000.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, and the number of moves already played. For each test case, it reads the moves already played and calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions where a rook has already been placed). It then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of different final configurations that can be reached after the remaining moves.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when the player places a rook on the diagonal). In this case, the computer skips its turn, and the player can place another rook on the same diagonal. The program correctly counts the number of different final configurations in this case.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
