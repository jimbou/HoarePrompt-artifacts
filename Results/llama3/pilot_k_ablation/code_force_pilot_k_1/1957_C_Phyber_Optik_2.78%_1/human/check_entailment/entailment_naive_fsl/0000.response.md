Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of counting the number of different final configurations in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the task is to continue playing until there are no valid moves remaining.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The dp array is used to store the number of possible configurations for each number of remaining valid moves. The function func_1 is used to initialize the dp array.

The program then reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, and the number of moves already played. For each test case, it reads the moves already played and calculates the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would attack another rook). It then prints the number of possible final configurations, which is stored in the dp array.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror a move (i.e., when r = c), and it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining, in which case the number of possible final configurations is 1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
