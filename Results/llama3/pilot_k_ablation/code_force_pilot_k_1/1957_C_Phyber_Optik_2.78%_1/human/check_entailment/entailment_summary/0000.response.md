Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp array is used to store the results of a recurrence relation, where dp[i] represents the number of possible final configurations for a chessboard of size i x i. The recurrence relation is dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, which is derived from the fact that for each valid move, there are two possible responses from the computer, and the number of valid moves is i - 1. The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3, which are derived from the fact that for a 1x1 chessboard, there is only one possible configuration, and for a 2x2 chessboard, there are three possible configurations. The program calculates the dp array up to n = 300000, and then for each test case, it prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], where invalid is the set of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

Correctness: **True**
