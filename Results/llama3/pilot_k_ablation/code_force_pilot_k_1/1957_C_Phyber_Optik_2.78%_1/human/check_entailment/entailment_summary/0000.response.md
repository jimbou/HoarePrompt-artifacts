Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for a given chessboard size n and number of moves k. The dynamic programming approach is used to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

The program first initializes a dp array of size 300007 with -1, which will store the calculated values of the sequence. The func_1 function calculates the values of the sequence up to n = 300000 using a recurrence relation and stores them in the dp array.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves, respectively. The program then reads k pairs of integers representing the moves.

For each test case, the program calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions that are already occupied by a rook) and stores them in a set called invalid. It then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of possible final configurations.

The recurrence relation used in the func_1 function is correct, and the program correctly calculates the values of the sequence using dynamic programming. The main part of the program correctly reads the input and calculates the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
