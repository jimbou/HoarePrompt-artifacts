#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is the result of the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i` in range 3 to `n`

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the nth value of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, storing the results in the dp array, where dp[i] represents the ith value in the sequence, and returns the calculated values.
