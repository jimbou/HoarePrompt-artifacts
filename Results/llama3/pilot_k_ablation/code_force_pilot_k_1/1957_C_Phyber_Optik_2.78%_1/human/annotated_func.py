#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[i] is the result of the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007 for i in range(3, n + 1), n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and stores the results of a recurrence relation in the dp array for a given positive integer n, where dp[i] is computed as (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007 for i in range(3, n + 1), with base cases dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.
