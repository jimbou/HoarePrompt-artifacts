This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a length and a list of integers. It then finds the first and last non-zero elements in the list, counts the number of zeros between them, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program in a state where all input has been consumed and all variables used within the function are no longer defined.
