Postcondition: ***`sIdx` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `length`, `sIdx` points to the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `sIdx` is equal to `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `t` is at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `eIdx` points to the last non-zero element in `arrs` or `eIdx` is -1 if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `cnt0` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 pair of lines minus the 2 lines read by the code, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx`, `i` is `sIdx`. The current value of `arrs[i]` is 0.***
