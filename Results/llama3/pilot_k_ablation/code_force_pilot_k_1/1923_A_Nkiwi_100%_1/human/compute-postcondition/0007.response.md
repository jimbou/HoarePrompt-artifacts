The value of `eIdx` is decremented by 1. The value of `eIdx` was `length - 1` and now it is `length - 2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least one zero element at index `length - 1`, `eIdx` is `length - 2`.
