Output State: **`sIdx` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `length`, `sIdx` points to the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `sIdx` is equal to `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `t` is at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers where the element at index `eIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 pair of lines minus the 2 lines read by the code**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The stdin still contains at least 1 pair of lines minus the 2 lines read by the code.
