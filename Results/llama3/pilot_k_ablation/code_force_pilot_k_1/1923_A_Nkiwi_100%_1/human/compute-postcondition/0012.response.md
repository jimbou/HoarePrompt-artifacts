Output State: **`sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` or `-1` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `cnt0` is 1, `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `sIdx`. The current value of `arrs[i]` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The index `i` is still at the position of the first non-zero element in `arrs` (or at the end of the array if all elements are zero), and the value of `arrs[i]` is still 0.
