According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t+2t-1 lines, where each of the following t pairs of lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1), such that at least one a_i is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `t` is at least 1 and the stdin contains at least 1 pair of lines.
State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains at least 1 pair of lines**
