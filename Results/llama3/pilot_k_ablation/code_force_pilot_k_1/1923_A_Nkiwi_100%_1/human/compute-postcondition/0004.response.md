The value of `sIdx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `sIdx` was 0, so the new value of `sIdx` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 pair of lines minus the 2 lines read by the code.
