Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, t must be greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1**

The code block reads the length of an array and the array itself from stdin, and assigns them to the variables `length` and `arrs`, respectively. It also initializes two indices, `sIdx` and `eIdx`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. The value of `t` is not modified by the code, but since one test case has been read from stdin, the number of remaining test cases is reduced by 1. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
