The code reads a pair of lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `length` and the second line contains a space-separated list of integers. The code then assigns the value of `length` to the variable `length`, and the list of integers to the variable `arrs`. The variables `sIdx` and `eIdx` are initialized to 0 and `length - 1`, respectively.

Output State: **t is at least 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, stdin contains at least 1 pair of lines minus the 2 lines read by the code**
