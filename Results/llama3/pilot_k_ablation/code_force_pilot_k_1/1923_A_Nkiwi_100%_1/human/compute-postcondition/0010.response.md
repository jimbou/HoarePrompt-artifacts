The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, sIdx and eIdx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `eIdx` is at least `sIdx`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` or `-1` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `cnt0` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx` and `i` is now `sIdx`. 
State: **`sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` or `-1` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `cnt0` is 0, `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `sIdx`**
