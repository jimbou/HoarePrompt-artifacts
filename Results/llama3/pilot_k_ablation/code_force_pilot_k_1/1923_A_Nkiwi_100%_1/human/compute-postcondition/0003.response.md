To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

1. **`sIdx < length`**: For this condition to be true, `sIdx` must be less than `length`. Since `sIdx` is 0 and `length` is an integer, we need to ensure that `length` is greater than 0 to satisfy this condition.

2. **`arrs[sIdx] == 0`**: Given that `sIdx` is 0, we need the first element of `arrs` to be 0 for this condition to be true.

Therefore, the states that need adjustment are `length` and the first element of `arrs`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 pair of lines minus the 2 lines read by the code**
