To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states accordingly. The loop head is `while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive)
- `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases
- `_` is 0
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `length` is an integer
- `arrs` is a list of integers
- `sIdx` is 0
- `eIdx` is `length - 1`

We need to adjust the states so that `sIdx < length` and `arrs[sIdx] == 0` are both true.

1. For `sIdx < length`, since `sIdx` is 0, `length` must be greater than 0 to satisfy this condition.
2. For `arrs[sIdx] == 0`, since `sIdx` is 0, the first element of `arrs` must be 0.

Other states like `t`, `stdin`, `_`, and `eIdx` do not affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive)
- `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases
- `_` is 0
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `length` must be greater than 0
- `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0
- `sIdx` is 0
- `eIdx` is `length - 1`

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`**
