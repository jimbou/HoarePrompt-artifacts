To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

Given the initial state:
- `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive).
- `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.
- `_` is 0.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `length` is an integer.
- `arrs` is a list of integers.
- `eIdx` is `length - 1`.

The loop condition depends on `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `arrs[eIdx]` must be 0.

Since `eIdx` is `length - 1`, and we know `length` is an integer, `eIdx` being greater than or equal to 0 is already guaranteed if `length` is greater than 0. However, we need to ensure that `arrs[eIdx]` is 0 for the loop to execute.

Given that `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, and `eIdx` is `length - 1`, for `arrs[eIdx]` to be 0, it must be that not all elements in `arrs` are zero, or if they are, then `eIdx` (being `length - 1`) would naturally point to a zero element if all are zero. However, the critical point is that `eIdx` must point to a zero element for the loop to start.

Thus, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `arrs` has at least one zero element at the index `eIdx` (which is `length - 1`), and since `eIdx` is dependent on `length`, ensuring `length` is greater than 0 is implicit in the condition that `eIdx` (which is `length - 1`) is greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least one zero element at index `length - 1`, `eIdx` is `length - 1`.**
