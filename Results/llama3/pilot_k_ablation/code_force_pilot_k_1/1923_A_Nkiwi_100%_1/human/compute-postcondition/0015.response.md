The code prints the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), where `sIdx` points to the first non-zero element in `arrs` or is equal to `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, and `eIdx` points to the last non-zero element in `arrs` or is -1 if all elements in `arrs` are 0.
Output: **cnt0 (where cnt0 is the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive))**
