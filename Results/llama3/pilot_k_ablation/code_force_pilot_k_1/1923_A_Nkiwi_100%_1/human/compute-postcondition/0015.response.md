The code prints the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), where `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, and `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` or `-1` if all elements in `arrs` are zero.

Output: **cnt0 (where cnt0 is the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive))**
