Output: ** `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` or `-1` if all elements in `arrs` are zero, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to `sIdx`, and the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) which is `cnt0` is being printed**
