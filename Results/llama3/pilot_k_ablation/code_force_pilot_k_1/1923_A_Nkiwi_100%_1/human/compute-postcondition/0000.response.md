The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. After the code is executed, the first integer is removed from the stdin, leaving `t` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1).**
