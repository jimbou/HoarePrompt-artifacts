The value of `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts the first line of the input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t+2t-1 lines, where t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000). Each of the following t pairs of lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1), such that at least one a_i is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t+2t-1 lines, where each of the following t pairs of lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1), such that at least one a_i is 1.**
