Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n binary digits (0s and 1s). It then counts the number of zeros in the middle of each test case, excluding leading and trailing zeros, and prints the count. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.**
