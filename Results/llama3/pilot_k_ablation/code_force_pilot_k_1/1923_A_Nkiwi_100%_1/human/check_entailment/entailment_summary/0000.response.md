Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads the input, finds the start and end indices of the first and last non-zero elements in the array, and then counts the number of zeros in between these indices.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately identifies the start and end indices of the block of non-zero elements and then counts the number of zeros within this block. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input array contains only zeros or only ones. In these cases, the program correctly outputs 0, indicating that no operations are required.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
