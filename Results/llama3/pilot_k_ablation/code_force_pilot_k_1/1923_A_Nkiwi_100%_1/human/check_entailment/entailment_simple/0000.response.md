Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `length` and the array `arrs` itself.

3. It then finds the start index `sIdx` and end index `eIdx` of the first and last chip in the array, respectively. This is done by iterating from the start and end of the array until it finds a chip (represented by 1).

4. It then counts the number of free cells `cnt0` between the start and end indices. This is done by iterating over the array from `sIdx` to `eIdx` and incrementing `cnt0` whenever it encounters a free cell (represented by 0).

5. Finally, it prints the count of free cells `cnt0`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no chips in the array (in which case `sIdx` and `eIdx` will be equal to `length` and 0, respectively, and `cnt0` will be 0) and where there are no free cells between the chips (in which case `cnt0` will be 0).

Correctness: **True**
