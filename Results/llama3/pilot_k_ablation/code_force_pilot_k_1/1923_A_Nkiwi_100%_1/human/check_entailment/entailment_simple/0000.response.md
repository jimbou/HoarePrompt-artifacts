Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `length` and the array `arrs` itself.

3. It then finds the start index `sIdx` of the first chip (1) from the left and the end index `eIdx` of the last chip (1) from the right. This is done by iterating over the array from both ends until it finds a chip (1).

4. It then counts the number of free cells (0) between the start and end indices (inclusive) and stores this count in `cnt0`.

5. Finally, it prints the count of free cells `cnt0`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
