Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the length of each test case, and the list of integers for each test case.

2. It correctly finds the start and end indices of the block of non-zero elements (chips) in the list. This is done by iterating from the start and end of the list until a non-zero element is found.

3. It correctly counts the number of zeros between the start and end indices of the block of non-zero elements. This is done by iterating over the range of indices between the start and end indices and incrementing a counter for each zero found.

4. It correctly prints the count of zeros, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
