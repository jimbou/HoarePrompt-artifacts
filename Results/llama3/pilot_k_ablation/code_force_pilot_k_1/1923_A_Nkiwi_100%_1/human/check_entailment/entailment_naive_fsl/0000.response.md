Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first finds the start and end indices of the block of chips by iterating through the array from both ends and stopping at the first non-zero element.

2. It then counts the number of zeros within this block, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

3. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are no chips (in which case the start and end indices will be equal, and the count of zeros will be zero) or when the chips are already in a single block (in which case the count of zeros will be zero).

4. The program also handles cases where there are multiple blocks of chips, as it only considers the block that contains the first and last chips.

5. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the array, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
