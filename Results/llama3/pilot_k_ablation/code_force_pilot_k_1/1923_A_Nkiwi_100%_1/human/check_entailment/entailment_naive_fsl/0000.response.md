Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first finds the start and end indices of the first and last chip in the array by iterating from the start and end of the array, respectively, until it finds a chip (i.e., a 1).
2. It then counts the number of free cells (i.e., 0s) between the start and end indices. This is done by iterating over the array from the start index to the end index and incrementing a counter whenever a free cell is encountered.
3. The count of free cells is then printed as the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that chips can only be moved to the closest free cell to the left. By counting the number of free cells between the start and end indices, the program is effectively counting the number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
