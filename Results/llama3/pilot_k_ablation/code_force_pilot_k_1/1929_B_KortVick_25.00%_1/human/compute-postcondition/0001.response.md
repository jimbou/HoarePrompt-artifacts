To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be at least 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), `_` is 0**
