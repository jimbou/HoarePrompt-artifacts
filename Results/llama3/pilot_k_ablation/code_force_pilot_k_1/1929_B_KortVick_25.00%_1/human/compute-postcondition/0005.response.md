The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, and half of `k` is odd.
Since `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, `k` can be represented as `2 * (2m + 1)`, where `m` is an integer. Therefore, `k // 2` is equal to `2m + 1`, and `k // 2 + 1` is equal to `2m + 2`.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). The current value of `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, and this is printed: `2m + 2`**
