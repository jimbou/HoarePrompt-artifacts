The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `k`. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, and either `k` is odd or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, we can analyze the possible values of `k / 2`.

If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a decimal value, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the nearest integer. For example, if `k` is 3, `k / 2` would be 1.5, and `ceil(k / 2)` would be 2.

If `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, then `k / 2` is already an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will simply return that integer value. For example, if `k` is 4, `k / 2` would be 2, and `ceil(k / 2)` would also be 2.

Since `k` is between 1 and 4n - 2, the maximum value of `k / 2` would be approximately 2n - 1. Therefore, the output will be an integer between 1 and 2n - 1.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 2n - 1 (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^8)**
