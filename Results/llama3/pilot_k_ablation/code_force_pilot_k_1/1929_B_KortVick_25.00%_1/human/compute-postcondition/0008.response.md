Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). Either k is odd or k is even and k // 2 is even, and the ceiling of k divided by 2 is being printed**
