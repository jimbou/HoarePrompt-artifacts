Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers: the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the given condition for each test case. The function processes multiple test cases and provides the minimum number of cells to be colored for each case.**
