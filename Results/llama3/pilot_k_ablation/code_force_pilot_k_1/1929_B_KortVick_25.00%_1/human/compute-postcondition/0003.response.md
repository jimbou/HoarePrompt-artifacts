Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). The current value of `k` is even and half of `k` is odd.***
