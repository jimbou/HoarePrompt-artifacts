Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with the first line removed). The current value of `k` is even, and half of `k` is odd.**
