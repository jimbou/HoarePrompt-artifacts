Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with the first line removed)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin, which contains multiple lines of input. The first line is removed from stdin after being used to assign values to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is still 0.
