Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is decreased by 1 because one line of input has been consumed. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the first line of input, which are within the specified ranges. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains `t - 1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.
