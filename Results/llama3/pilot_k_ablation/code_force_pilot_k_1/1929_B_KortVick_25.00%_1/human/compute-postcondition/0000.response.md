Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining lines contain two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive) and `k` is between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive).
