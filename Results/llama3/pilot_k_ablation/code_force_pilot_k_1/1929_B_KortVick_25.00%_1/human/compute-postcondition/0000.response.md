Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**.

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k, where n is between 2 and 10^8, and k is between 1 and 4n - 2.
