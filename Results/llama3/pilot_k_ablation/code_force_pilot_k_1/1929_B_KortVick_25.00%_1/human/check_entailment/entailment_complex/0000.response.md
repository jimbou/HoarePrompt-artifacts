Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the two cases for k: when k is even and k // 2 is odd, and when k is even and k // 2 is even, or when k is odd. In the first case, it prints k // 2 + 1, and in the second case, it prints ceil(k / 2). This is because when k is even and k // 2 is odd, we need to color one more cell to cover the extra diagonal, and when k is even and k // 2 is even, or when k is odd, we can cover all diagonals with k // 2 or ceil(k / 2) cells.

Correctness: **True**
