Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the given condition for each test case. The program uses the mathematical property that the minimum number of cells to be colored is equal to the ceiling of half of the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. This property is based on the fact that each diagonal can be covered by at most two cells, and the program takes into account the cases where the number of diagonals is odd or even.

The program handles the cases where the number of diagonals is odd or even correctly. When the number of diagonals is odd, the program prints the ceiling of half of the number of diagonals. When the number of diagonals is even, the program checks if the number of diagonals divided by 2 is odd. If it is, the program prints the number of diagonals divided by 2 plus 1. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling of half of the number of diagonals.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of diagonals is less than or equal to 2n - 2, where n is the size of the square grid. In this case, the program prints the ceiling of half of the number of diagonals.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
