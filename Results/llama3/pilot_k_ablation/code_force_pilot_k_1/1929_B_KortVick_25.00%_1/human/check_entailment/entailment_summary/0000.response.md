Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads the size of the square grid (n) and the minimum number of diagonals (k) that should have at least one colored cell.

The program then uses a conditional statement to check if k is even and k/2 is odd. If this condition is true, it prints k/2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/2 using the ceil function from the math module.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

- If k is even and k/2 is odd, it means that k/2 is a half-integer (e.g., 3.5, 5.5, etc.). In this case, we need to color at least k/2 + 1 cells to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

- If k is odd or k/2 is even, it means that k/2 is an integer (e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc.). In this case, we need to color at least k/2 cells to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program's approach is correct because it covers all possible cases and provides the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
