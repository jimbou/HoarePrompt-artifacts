Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line**

In this output state, the variable `clues` is assigned a list of integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line, since one line has been read to assign the value to `clues`. The values of the other variables, `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
