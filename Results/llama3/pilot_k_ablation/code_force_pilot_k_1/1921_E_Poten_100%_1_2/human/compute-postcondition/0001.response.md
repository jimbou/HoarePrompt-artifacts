According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one line, `i` is 0**
