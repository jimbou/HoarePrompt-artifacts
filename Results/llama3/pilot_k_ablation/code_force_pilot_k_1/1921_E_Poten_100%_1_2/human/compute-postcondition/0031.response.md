Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the number of test cases remains between 1 and 10,000, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the list of clues remains unchanged, and the variable `i` is still 0. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus one line. The conditions on the list of clues, specifically the relationships between the third and fifth elements, remain the same.
