Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list with one element 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The current value of the third element of `clues` is equal to the current value of the fifth element of `clues`**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Alice' as its first element. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the elements of `clues` are still valid.
