Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. The current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]`, or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw', while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]`, or `clues[0]` is 1, is still valid.
