Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still between 1 and 10^4. The list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The list of clues remains the same. The value of `i` is still 0. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus one line. All the conditions related to the elements of the `clues` list are still valid.
