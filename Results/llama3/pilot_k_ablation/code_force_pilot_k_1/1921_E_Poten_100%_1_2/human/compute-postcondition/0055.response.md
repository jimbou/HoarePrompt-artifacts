The code prints the first element of the `answers` list which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
Output: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case and must have at least 1 element, `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, stdin contains no test cases, and the first element of the `answers` list which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' is being printed**
