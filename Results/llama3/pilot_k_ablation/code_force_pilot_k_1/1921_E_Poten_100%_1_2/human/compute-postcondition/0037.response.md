Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2 is less than or equal to the difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Alice', while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
