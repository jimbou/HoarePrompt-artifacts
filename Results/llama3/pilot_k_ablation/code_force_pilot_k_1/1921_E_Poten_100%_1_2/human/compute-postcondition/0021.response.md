Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Bob', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The number of test cases, the list of clues, the value of `i`, and the input in stdin are all the same as before. The relationships between the elements of the `clues` list, such as their parities and differences, are also unchanged.
