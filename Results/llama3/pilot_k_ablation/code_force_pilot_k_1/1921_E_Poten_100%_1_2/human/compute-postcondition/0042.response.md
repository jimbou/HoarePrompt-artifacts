Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still between 1 and 10^4. The list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The list of clues remains the same. The value of i is still 0. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus one line. All the conditions related to the elements of the clues list are still valid.
