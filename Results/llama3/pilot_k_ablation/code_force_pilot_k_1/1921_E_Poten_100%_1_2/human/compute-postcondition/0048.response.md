Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice' or 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not 1, then `answers` contains either 'Alice' or 'Draw' based on the conditions: if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues` and the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2 is less than the difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. If the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues` and the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2 is not less than the difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues` and the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues` and the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is not greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
