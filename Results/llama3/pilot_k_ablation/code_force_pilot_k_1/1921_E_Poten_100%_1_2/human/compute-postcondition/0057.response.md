Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's and Bob's. It then determines the winner of a game based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board, and prints the result for each test case. The possible outcomes are 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', indicating whether the game is a draw or which player wins. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were input.**
