Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd).**
