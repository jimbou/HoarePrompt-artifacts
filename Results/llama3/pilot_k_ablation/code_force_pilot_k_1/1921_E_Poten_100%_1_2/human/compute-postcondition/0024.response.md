Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
