Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line. The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd).**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Bob'. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `clues` and `stdin` are still valid.
