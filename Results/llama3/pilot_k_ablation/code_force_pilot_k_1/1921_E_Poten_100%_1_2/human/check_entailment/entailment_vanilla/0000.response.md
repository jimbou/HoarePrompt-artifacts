Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are well-defined, and the program attempts to cover all possible scenarios.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if Alice's initial position is below Bob's or if the board has only one row. In either case, it correctly concludes that the game will end in a draw.

2. If the row numbers of Alice and Bob have the same parity (both even or both odd), it checks if their column numbers are the same. If they are, it correctly concludes that Bob will win.

3. If the column numbers are different, it checks if the difference between the column numbers is greater than half the difference between the row numbers. If it is, the game will end in a draw; otherwise, Bob will win.

4. If the row numbers of Alice and Bob have different parities, it checks if their column numbers are the same. If they are, it correctly concludes that Alice will win.

5. If the column numbers are different, it checks if the difference between the column numbers is 1. If it is, Alice will win.

6. If the difference between the column numbers is greater than 1, it checks if the difference between the column numbers is greater than half the difference between the row numbers. If it is, the game will end in a draw; otherwise, Alice will win.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible scenarios. However, the code can be improved for better readability and maintainability.

Correctness: **True**
