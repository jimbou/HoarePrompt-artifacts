Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program fails is when Alice's chip is in the second row and Bob's chip is in the second column, and the board has more than two rows. In this case, the program will incorrectly determine the outcome of the game.

For example, if the input is:

    3 3 2 1 1 2

The program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move her chip to the cell (3, 2) and win the game.

The program's logic is incorrect because it does not properly consider all possible moves and their outcomes. It only checks if the chips are in the same column or if the difference between their rows is even or odd, but it does not take into account the actual moves that can be made and their consequences. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
