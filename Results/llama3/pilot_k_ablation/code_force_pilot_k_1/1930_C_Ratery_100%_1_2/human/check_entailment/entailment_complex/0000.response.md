Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3.  It calculates the sum of each element in the array and its 1-based index, effectively implementing the operation `a_i + i` described in the problem. This is done using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and value of each element in the array.
4.  The resulting array is sorted in descending order, which is necessary to find the lexicographically largest `b`.
5.  The program then constructs the array `b` by taking the largest element from the sorted array and appending the largest `n-1` elements (or the element minus 1 if it's greater than or equal to the largest element). This is done using a loop that starts from the second element in the sorted array.
6.  Finally, the program prints the constructed array `b` for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the provided execution states, the program correctly implements the required operations and logic. It correctly calculates the sums, sorts the array, constructs the new array `b`, and prints the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
