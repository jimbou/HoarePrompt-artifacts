Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first calculates the sum of each element in the array with its index (1-indexed) and stores it in a new array `arr`.
2. It then sorts `arr` in descending order.
3. The program initializes the answer array `ans` with the first element of `arr`.
4. For each remaining element `x` in `arr`, it checks if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`. If it is, it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`. Otherwise, it appends `x` to `ans`.
5. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` in the desired format.

The program correctly implements the problem description by:

* Selecting the largest possible elements from `arr` and adding them to `ans` in descending order.
* Ensuring that each element in `ans` is unique by appending `ans[-1] - 1` when `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`.
* Handling the case where `x` is less than the last element in `ans` by simply appending `x` to `ans`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
