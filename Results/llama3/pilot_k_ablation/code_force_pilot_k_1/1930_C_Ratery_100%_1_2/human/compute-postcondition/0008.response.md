Based on the initial state, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains the largest element of `arr` and the largest `n-1` elements of `arr` (or `arr` minus 1 if the element is greater than or equal to the largest element in `arr`). Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, the largest element of `arr` is the first element, and the largest `n-1` elements are the remaining elements in the list.

If `arr` has only one element, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`, which is the only element in `arr`.

Since `x` is the last element in the list, it is not directly related to the print statement.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list, which are the largest element of `arr` and the largest `n-1` elements of `arr` (or `arr` minus 1 if the element is greater than or equal to the largest element in `arr`).

Output: **The largest element of arr and the largest n-1 elements of arr (or arr minus 1 if the element is greater than or equal to the largest element in arr)**
