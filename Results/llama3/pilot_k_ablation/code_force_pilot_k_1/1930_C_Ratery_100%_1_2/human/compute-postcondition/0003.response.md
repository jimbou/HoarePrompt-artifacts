Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to 10^9, sorted in descending order, with each element being the sum of its original value and its 1-based index that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and the second largest element of `arr` minus 1, the current value of `x` is the second element in the list and is greater than or equal to the largest element in `arr`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the second largest element of `arr` minus 1, in addition to the largest element of `arr`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
