Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to 10^9, sorted in descending order, with each element being the sum of its original value and its 1-based index that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and the second element in the list, `x` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `x` is greater than or equal to the largest element in `arr`, the second largest element in `ans` is the second largest element of `arr` minus 1. Otherwise, the second largest element in `ans` is the second element in the list.***
