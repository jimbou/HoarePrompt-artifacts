This function takes no input parameters and returns no output parameters. It reads a non-negative integer t from the user, then for each of t inputs, it reads an integer n and a string arr. It counts the number of '1' characters in arr and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list based on the count. If the count is 0, it appends 'yes'. If the count is odd, it appends 'no'. If the count is even, it appends 'yes' unless the count is exactly 2 and '11' is in arr, in which case it appends 'no'. Finally, it prints all the results. The function does not modify the input variables or the current working directory.
