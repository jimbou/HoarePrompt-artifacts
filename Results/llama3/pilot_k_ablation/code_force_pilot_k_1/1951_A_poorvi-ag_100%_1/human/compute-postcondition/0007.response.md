The code appends the string 'no' to the list results. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of count_ones is still odd.

Output State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 0, results is a list containing the string 'no', _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, count_ones is an integer greater than 0 and the current value of count_ones is odd.**
