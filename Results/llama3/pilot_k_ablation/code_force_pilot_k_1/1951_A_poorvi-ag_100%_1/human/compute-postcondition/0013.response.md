Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string that does not contain the substring '11', `count_ones` is an integer greater than 0, and `count_ones` is even and equals 2.**

In this output state, the code has appended the string 'yes' to the `results` list, which was initially empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `count_ones` is even and equals 2 is still valid after the code has been executed.
