Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the current working directory contains subfolders with names that are digits within the range `[start, end]`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is 0, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains the string 'yes'. The current working directory and the value of `count_ones` also remain unchanged. There is still no input in stdin.
