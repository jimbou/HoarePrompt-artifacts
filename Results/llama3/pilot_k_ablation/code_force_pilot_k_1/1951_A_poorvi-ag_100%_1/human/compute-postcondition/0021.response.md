To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `r` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 string, the loop will execute. Since `t` is an integer and `results` is a list of strings, we can adjust the state as follows:

* If `t` is 0, `results` is an empty list, so the loop will not execute. However, we can still adjust the state to reflect that `r` is not defined (or is `None`) since the loop will not iterate.
* If `t` is greater than 0, `results` contains `t` strings. For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least 1 string. We can adjust the state to reflect that `r` is the first string in the `results` list.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an integer, `results` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `r` is the first string in the `results` list**
