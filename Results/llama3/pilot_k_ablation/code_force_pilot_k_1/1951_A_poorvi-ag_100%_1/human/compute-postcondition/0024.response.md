Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an integer, `results` is a list of strings, `r` is the last string in the `results` list. If `t` is 0, `results` is an empty list. If `t` is greater than 0, `results` contains `t` strings, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no'. For each string in `results`, if the corresponding count_ones is 0 or even and not equal to 2 or '11' is not in the corresponding arr, the string is 'yes'. Otherwise, the string is 'no'. All strings in the `results` list have been printed.**
