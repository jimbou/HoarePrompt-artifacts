Functionality: **This function takes an integer input t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a binary string arr. It then checks the number of '1's in the string and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list based on the following conditions: if there are no '1's or an even number of '1's (not equal to 2) or '11' is not in the string, it appends 'yes'; otherwise, it appends 'no'. Finally, it prints all the strings in the results list.**
