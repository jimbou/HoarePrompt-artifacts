Postcondition: ***`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the current working directory contains subfolders with names that are digits within the range `[start, end]`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in `arr`, `count_ones` is larger than 0, and `count_ones` is even. If `count_ones` is exactly 2, then if '11' is in `arr`, `results` contains 'no', otherwise `results` contains 'yes'. If `count_ones` is not equal to 2, then `results` contains 'yes'.***
