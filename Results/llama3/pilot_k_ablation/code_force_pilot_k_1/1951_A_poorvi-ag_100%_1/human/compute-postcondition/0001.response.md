To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the current working directory contains subfolders with names that are digits within the range [start, end], `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, stdin contains one less input than before**
