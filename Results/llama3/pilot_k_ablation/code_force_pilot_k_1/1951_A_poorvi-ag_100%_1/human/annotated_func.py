#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers, start is less than or equal to end, and the current working directory contains subfolders with names that are digits within the range [start, end].

    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    #State: start is an integer, end is an integer, start is less than or equal to end, the current working directory contains subfolders with names that are digits within the range [start, end], t is a non-negative integer, results is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' for each of the t inputs, n is an integer, arr is a string, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in arr. If count_ones is 0, the corresponding result is 'yes'. If count_ones is larger than 0, then if count_ones is odd, the corresponding result is 'no'. If count_ones is even, then if count_ones is exactly 2 and '11' is in arr, the corresponding result is 'no', otherwise the corresponding result is 'yes'.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the current working directory contains subfolders with names that are digits within the range `[start, end]`, `t` is a non-negative integer, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in `arr`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no input parameters and returns no output parameters. It reads a non-negative integer t from the user, then for each of t inputs, it reads an integer n and a string arr. It counts the number of '1' characters in arr and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list based on the count. If the count is 0, it appends 'yes'. If the count is odd, it appends 'no'. If the count is even, it appends 'yes' unless the count is exactly 2 and '11' is in arr, in which case it appends 'no'. Finally, it prints all the results. The function does not modify the input variables or the current working directory.
