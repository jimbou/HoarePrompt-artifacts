Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to generate files for HTML files in a range of folders, but the program does not handle the case where the folder name is not a digit. The program only checks if the folder name is a digit and if it is within the specified range, but it does not handle the case where the folder name is not a digit.

For example, if the current directory contains a folder named "abc" which is not a digit, the program will not handle this case correctly. The program will not generate files for the HTML files in this folder, even if the folder name is within the specified range.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
