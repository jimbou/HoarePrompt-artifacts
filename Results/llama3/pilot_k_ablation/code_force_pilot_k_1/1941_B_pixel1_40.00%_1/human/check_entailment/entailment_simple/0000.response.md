Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 performs the operation on the array, func_2 checks if all elements in the array are zero, and func_3 is the main function that iteratively applies the operation to the array until it is possible to make all elements zero or it is determined that it is not possible.

The program's logic is correct. It first checks if the array is already all zeros using func_2. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements), applies the operation to the array at that index using func_1, and then checks again if the array is all zeros using func_2. If the array is all zeros, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If the loop executes 100 times without the array becoming all zeros, it appends 'NO' to the answers list.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The loop in func_3 is limited to 100 iterations. If the array requires more than 100 operations to become all zeros, the program will incorrectly append 'NO' to the answers list. To fix this, the loop should be modified to continue until the array is all zeros or it is determined that it is not possible to make all elements zero.

Correctness: **False**
