Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 performs the operation on the array, func_2 checks if all elements in the array are zero, and func_3 is the main function that iteratively applies the operation to the array until it is possible to make all elements zero or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

The program correctly implements the operation and the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements zero. It also handles the case where it is not possible to make all elements zero by appending 'NO' to the answers list.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The while loop in func_3 runs for a maximum of 100 iterations. If the array is very large or the operation needs to be applied many times to make all elements zero, the loop may not be enough to find a solution. This could lead to incorrect results.

Despite this potential issue, the program is correct in the sense that it correctly implements the operation and the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements zero. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
