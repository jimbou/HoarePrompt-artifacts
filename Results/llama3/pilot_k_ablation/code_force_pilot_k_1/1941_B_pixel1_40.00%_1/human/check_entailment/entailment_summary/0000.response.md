Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

Function 1 (func_1) correctly implements this operation by modifying the input list accordingly.

Function 2 (func_2) checks if a given list contains only zeros or is empty, which is a necessary condition for Rudolf to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

Function 3 (func_3) is the main function that determines whether the input array can be transformed into a desired state by repeatedly applying the operation (func_1) and checking if the transformed list meets the condition (func_2). It correctly appends 'YES' to the answers list if the condition is met, 'NO' if the highest number in the list becomes negative, and 'NO' by default if the transformation is repeated 100 times without meeting the condition.

However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation of Function 3. The loop_counter variable is used to limit the number of transformations to 100, but this is an arbitrary limit and does not guarantee that the transformation will converge to the desired state. In fact, the problem statement does not impose any limit on the number of transformations. Therefore, the program may incorrectly append 'NO' to the answers list if the transformation requires more than 100 iterations.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the input array has less than 3 elements. In such cases, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should append 'NO' to the answers list.

Correctness: **False**
