Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(array, index)`: This function applies the operation to the array at the specified index.

2. `func_2(arrayForSuccess)`: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.

3. `func_3(inputarray)`: This function is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the array equal to zero. It first checks if the array is already all zeros. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements), applies the operation at that index, and checks if the resulting array is all zeros. If the loop runs 100 times without finding a solution, it returns 'NO'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- The loop in `func_3` runs a fixed number of times (100), which may not be sufficient for all cases. A more robust approach would be to continue the loop until no more operations can be applied or a solution is found.

- The program does not handle the case where the input array has less than 3 elements. According to the problem statement, the array should have at least 3 elements.

- The program does not check if the input array contains negative numbers. According to the problem statement, the array elements should be non-negative.

- The program does not handle the case where the input array is not a list of integers.

Considering these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
