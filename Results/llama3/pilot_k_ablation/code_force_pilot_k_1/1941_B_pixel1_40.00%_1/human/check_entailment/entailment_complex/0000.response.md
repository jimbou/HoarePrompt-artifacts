Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array of integers can be made equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing the elements at index - 1, index, and index + 1 in the input list by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 implements the operation, func_2 checks if all elements in the input list are 0 or if the list is empty, and func_3 uses these two functions to determine whether the input array can be made equal to zero.

The program iterates through the input array, finding the maximum value excluding the first and last elements, and applies the operation to the array. If all elements in the array become 0 at any point, the program appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If the loop runs for 99 iterations without all elements becoming 0, the program appends 'NO' to the answers list.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses a reasonable approach to solve the problem. However, the program has a limitation that it only runs the loop for 99 iterations. If the array cannot be made equal to zero within 99 iterations, the program will incorrectly append 'NO' to the answers list.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False** because it does not guarantee a correct result for all possible inputs. The program should be modified to run the loop until all elements in the array become 0 or until it is proven that the array cannot be made equal to zero.

Correctness: **False**
