Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` applies the operation to the array, decrementing the elements at indices `index - 1`, `index`, and `index + 1` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

`func_2` checks if a given list of integers contains only zeros or is empty. It returns `True` if the list is empty or contains only zeros, and `False` otherwise.

`func_3` is the main function that determines whether the array can be transformed into a desired state. It first checks if the array is already in the desired state using `func_2`. If it is, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If not, it enters a loop that applies the operation to the array using `func_1` and checks if the transformed array meets the condition using `func_2`. If the condition is met, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the highest number in the array becomes negative, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop executes 100 times without meeting the condition, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list by default.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a potential issue with the loop in `func_3`. The loop is limited to 100 iterations, which may not be sufficient for all possible input arrays. If the array requires more than 100 iterations to reach the desired state, the program will incorrectly append 'NO' to the `answers` list.

Correctness: **False**
