Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    7
    
    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Annotated Functions:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers and index is an integer such that 2 <= index <= len(array) - 1.
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array
    #The program returns a list of integers where the element at index - 1 is decremented by 1, the element at index is decremented by 2, and the element at index + 1 is decremented by 1, and index remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decrements the elements at index - 1, index, and index + 1 in the input list by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, and returns the modified list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers.
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers, if the loop executes then all elements in the list are 0, if the loop does not execute then arrayForSuccess is an empty list.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that either all elements in the list arrayForSuccess are 0 or the list is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if all elements in the input list are 0 or if the list is empty, returning True if the condition is met and False otherwise.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, and answers is a list that is accessible within the scope of this function.
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')

    #State: `loop_counter` is 100, `answers` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `inputarray` is a list of integers, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` in `inputarray`. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns True at any point, `answers` will contain 'YES' and the loop will terminate early. If `func_2(inputarray)` never returns True, `answers` will contain 'NO' and the loop will run for 99 iterations.
    answers.append('NO')

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of integers meets a certain condition defined by the function func_2. It iterates through the list, finding the maximum value excluding the first and last elements, and applies the function func_1 to the list. If func_2 returns True at any point, the function appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If the loop runs for 99 iterations without func_2 returning True, the function appends 'NO' to the answers list. The function returns the answers list containing either 'YES' or 'NO'.
