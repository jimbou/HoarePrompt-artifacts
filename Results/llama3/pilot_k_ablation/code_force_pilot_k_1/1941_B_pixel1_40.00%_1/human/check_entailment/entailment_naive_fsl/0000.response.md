Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program only applies the operation to the index with the highest number in the array, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy. 

A counterexample is the array [1, 2, 7, 2]. The program will apply the operation to the index with the highest number (index 2), resulting in the array [1, 1, 5, 2]. However, this is not the optimal solution, as the program will not be able to make all elements zero.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated strategy, such as using dynamic programming to find the optimal sequence of operations.
