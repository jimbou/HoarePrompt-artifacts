Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the input array has a length of 3 and the elements are [7, 1, 0]. The program will output 'NO', but the correct output should be 'NO' because it is not possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it uses a brute force approach with a limited number of iterations (100), which is not sufficient to cover all possible cases. The program should be modified to use a more efficient algorithm or to increase the number of iterations to cover all possible cases.

Additionally, the program uses a function `func_1` that modifies the input array, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The program should be modified to avoid modifying the input array.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
