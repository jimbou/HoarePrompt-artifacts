Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list of strings that is accessible within the scope of this function and contains 'YES' as its last element, and the current value of `func_2(inputarray)` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `inputarray` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `answers` now contains the string 'YES' as its last element, in addition to its previous elements. The value of `func_2(inputarray)` is still True, as the code does not modify this value.
