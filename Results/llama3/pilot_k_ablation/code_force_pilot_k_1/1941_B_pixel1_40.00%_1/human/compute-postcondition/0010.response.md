Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list of strings, loop_counter is 1, func_2(inputarray) returns False, length is the number of elements in inputarray and must be at least 3, if inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is the value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is elementIndex which is 1, elementIndex is 1. Otherwise, the values of highestNumber, highestIndex and elementIndex remain unchanged.***
