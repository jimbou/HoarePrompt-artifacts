Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns False, `elementIndex` is 1. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `highestNumber` and `highestIndex`.***
