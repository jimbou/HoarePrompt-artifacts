Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `answers` is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO', `inputarray` is a list of integers, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` excluding the first and last elements, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` in `inputarray`.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'NO' as its last element, while the other variables remain unchanged. The loop counter remains at 100, and the other variables retain their initial values. The list `answers` now contains at least one 'NO' and may also contain 'YES' if `func_2(inputarray)` returns True at any point.
