Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list of strings containing 'NO'**.

In this output state, the value of `loop_counter` remains unchanged at 100, and `inputarray` is still a list of integers. However, the list `answers` now contains the string 'NO' as its last element, which was appended by the executed code. The loop's termination conditions, such as `func_2(inputarray)` returning True or `highestNumber` being less than 0, are not affected by this code snippet.
