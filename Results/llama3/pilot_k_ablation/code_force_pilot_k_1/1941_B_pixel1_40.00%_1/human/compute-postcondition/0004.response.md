Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list of strings, `loop_counter` is 1, and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returns False.**

In this output state, the values of `inputarray` and `answers` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The variable `loop_counter` is assigned the value 1. The function `func_2(inputarray)` still returns False, as the code does not modify its behavior.
