Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value or variable. The state of the variables remains the same: `inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list of strings with 'NO' appended to it, `loop_counter` is 1, `func_2(inputarray)` returns False, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in the sublist of `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2` and is less than 0, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist of `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`.**
