Output State: **The program returns nothing.**

Since the return statement is empty, the program does not return any value. The state of the variables remains the same as the initial state. The `answers` list still contains 'NO', `loop_counter` is still 1, `length` is still the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is still less than 0, and `highestIndex` is still -1.
