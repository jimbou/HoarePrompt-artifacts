Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list containing 'NO', `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)` returns False. The current value of `highestNumber` is less than 0, and the current value of `highestIndex` is -1. The length of `inputarray` is less than 3.**

The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `inputarray` is still less than 3, and `func_2(inputarray)` still returns False. The values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are still less than 0 and -1, respectively.
