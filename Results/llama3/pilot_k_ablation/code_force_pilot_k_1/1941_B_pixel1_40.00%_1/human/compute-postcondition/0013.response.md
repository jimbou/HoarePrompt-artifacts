Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, `answers` is a list of strings with 'NO' appended to it, `loop_counter` is 1, `func_2(inputarray)` returns False, `length` is the number of elements in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in the sublist of `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2` and is less than 0, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist of `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list of strings `answers` now has 'NO' appended to it, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of integers `inputarray` and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returning False are still valid, and the values of `loop_counter`, `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` are unchanged.
