The only variables in the loop head are variables  elementIndex and length, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `elementIndex` and `length`. If length is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list of strings, loop_counter is 1 and must not be equal to 100, func_2(inputarray) returns False, length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `length` is at least 3 and elementIndex is now 1. 
State: **inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list of strings, loop_counter is 1 and must not be equal to 100, func_2(inputarray) returns False, length is the number of elements in inputarray and must be at least 3, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, elementIndex is 1**
