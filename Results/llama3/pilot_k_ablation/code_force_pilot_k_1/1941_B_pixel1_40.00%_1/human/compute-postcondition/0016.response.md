Output State: **loop_counter is 100, inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list of strings. If at any point during the loop's execution, func_2(inputarray) returns True, then answers will contain 'YES' and the loop will terminate early. If at any point during the loop's execution, the highestNumber is less than 0, then answers will contain 'NO' and the loop will terminate early. If the loop executes 99 times without func_2(inputarray) returning True or highestNumber being less than 0, then answers will not contain 'YES' or 'NO'.**
