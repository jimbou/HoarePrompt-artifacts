Functionality: **This function determines whether a given list of integers can be transformed into a desired state by repeatedly applying a transformation function (func_1) and checks if the transformed list meets a certain condition (func_2). It appends 'YES' to the answers list if the condition is met, 'NO' if the highest number in the list becomes negative, and 'NO' by default if the transformation is repeated 100 times without meeting the condition. The function returns nothing.**
