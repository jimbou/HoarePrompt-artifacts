The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 1 and `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, which is -1, `highestIndex` becomes 1 and `highestNumber` becomes the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, answers is a list, loop_counter is 1, length is at least 3, highestNumber is the value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is 1, func_2(inputarray) returns False, elementIndex is 1**
