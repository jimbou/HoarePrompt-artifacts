Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, it calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. The program then checks if the sum of the amounts of coins to bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the sum of the amounts of coins to bet on all outcomes is not less than the LCM, in which case it prints -1. The program also correctly handles the case where the multipliers are all equal, in which case the LCM is equal to the multiplier and the program prints 1 for each outcome.

The program's use of the gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome is also correct, as it ensures that the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome are minimized.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
