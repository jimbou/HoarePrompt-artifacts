Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input, calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, and then finds the highest common factor (HCF) of the LCM divided by each multiplier. It then checks if the sum of the HCF divided by each multiplier is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the HCF divided by each multiplier as the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the GCD of two numbers, which is used to find the HCF of a list of numbers. The execution summary shows that the program correctly calculates the GCD of a list of integers.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the LCM and HCF of the multipliers, and it checks if the sum of the HCF divided by each multiplier is less than the LCM. If the sum is less than the LCM, it prints the HCF divided by each multiplier as the bets for each outcome, which is the correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
