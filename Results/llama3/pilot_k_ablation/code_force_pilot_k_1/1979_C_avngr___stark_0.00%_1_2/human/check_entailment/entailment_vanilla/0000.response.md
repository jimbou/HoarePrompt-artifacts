Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input, and then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.
2.  Then, for each outcome, the program calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome.
3.  The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the amounts calculated in the previous step. This is done using a custom function `func_1` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the HCF.
4.  The program then divides each amount by the HCF to get the final amount of coins to bet on each outcome.
5.  Finally, the program checks if the sum of all the final amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints out the final amounts; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few potential issues with the program:

*   The program assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., the number of outcomes will be between 1 and 50, and the multipliers will be between 2 and 20. If the input is invalid, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
*   The program uses a custom function `func_1` to calculate the HCF, which may not be the most efficient way to do so. The `math.gcd` function could be used instead, which is more efficient and easier to read.
*   The program does not handle the case where the sum of all the final amounts is equal to the LCM. In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, but it could be improved by adding input validation, using more efficient functions, and handling edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
