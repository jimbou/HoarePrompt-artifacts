Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input, calculates the bets for each outcome, and checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to calculate the bets for each outcome. It first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers, then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bet for each outcome. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the bets and divides each bet by the GCD to minimize the bets.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the bets for each outcome using the LCM and GCD, and checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
