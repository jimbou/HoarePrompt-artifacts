Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to find a distribution of coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers k_i to find a distribution of coins that satisfies the condition. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers and then divides it by each multiplier to find the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. The program then checks if the sum of the amounts of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers. This function is used to find the GCD of the amounts of coins bet on each outcome, which is then used to reduce the amounts of coins bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. The use of the LCM and GCD concepts is appropriate for this problem, and the program's implementation is efficient and clear.

Correctness: **True**
