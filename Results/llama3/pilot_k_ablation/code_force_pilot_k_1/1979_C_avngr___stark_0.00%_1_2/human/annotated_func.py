#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list `numbers`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers.
