Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first integer and the second integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the second integer in the list `numbers`**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of the first integer and the second integer in the list `numbers`. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged. The `gcd` function is assumed to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.
