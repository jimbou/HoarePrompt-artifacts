To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`. According to the code, the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `numbers` to reflect this.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the first integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the second integer in the list `numbers`**
