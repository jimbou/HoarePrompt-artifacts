Output: **`k`, `a`, and `x` are integers, `s` is 1 plus `x` times the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus `x`, `i` is `x-1` if `x` is greater than 0, `i` is -1 if `x` is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, and it is printed whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not, where the result is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and 'NO' otherwise**
