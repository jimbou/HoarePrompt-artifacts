The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since stdin contains at least one line of input that is a single integer `t` and `t` lines of input, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, after this line, stdin will contain `t-1` lines of input. The second line assigns the value 1 to `s`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers**
