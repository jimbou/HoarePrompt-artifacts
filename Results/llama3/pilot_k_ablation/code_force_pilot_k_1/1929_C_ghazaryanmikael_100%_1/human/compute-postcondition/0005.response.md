To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the condition within the print statement.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `k` is an integer between 2 and 30.
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
   - `s` is at least 2 and is calculated as 1 plus `x` times the sum of `s // (k - 1) + 1`. This implies `s` is dependent on the values of `x` and `k`, and it's a dynamic value that changes based on the input or previous calculations.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `k` are not provided, which means we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s` or directly compare `a` and `s`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition provided.

- If `a` (an integer between 1 and 10^9) is greater than or equal to `s` (which is at least 2 and depends on `x` and `k`), the statement will print 'YES'.
- If `a` is less than `s`, the statement will print 'NO'.

Since we don't have the specific values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `k`, we can't definitively say whether 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, 'NO' otherwise**
