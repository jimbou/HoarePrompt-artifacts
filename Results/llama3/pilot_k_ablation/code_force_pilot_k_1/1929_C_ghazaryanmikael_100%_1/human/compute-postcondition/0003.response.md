Output State: **`k`, `a`, and `x` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`, `i` is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`. The integer division `s // (k - 1)` means that the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number. The other variables remain unchanged.
