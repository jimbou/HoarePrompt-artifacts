Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers, `i` is 0**

The value of `s` is increased by the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus 1. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `k-1` is at least 1, and the integer division of `s` by `k-1` is at least 1. Therefore, `s` is increased by at least 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
