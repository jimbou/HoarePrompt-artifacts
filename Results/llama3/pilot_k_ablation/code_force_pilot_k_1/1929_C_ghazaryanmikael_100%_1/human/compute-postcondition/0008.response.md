Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains three integers (k, x, and a). It then calculates a value (s) based on k and x, and prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise, for each test case. After processing all test cases, stdin is empty and the function has printed a 'YES' or 'NO' result for each test case.**
