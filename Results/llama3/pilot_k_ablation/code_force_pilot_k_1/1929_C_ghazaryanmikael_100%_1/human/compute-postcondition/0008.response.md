Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
