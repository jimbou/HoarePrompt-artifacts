The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value returned by `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least 1 test case and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
