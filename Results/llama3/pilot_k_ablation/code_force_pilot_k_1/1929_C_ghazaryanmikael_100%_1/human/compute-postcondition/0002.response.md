According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, and _ is 0, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 0.

State: **`k`, `a`, and `x` are integers, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, _ is 0, `i` is 0**
