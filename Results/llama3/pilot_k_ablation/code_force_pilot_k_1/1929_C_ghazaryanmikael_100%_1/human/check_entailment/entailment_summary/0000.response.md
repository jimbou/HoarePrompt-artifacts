Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The key insight is that Sasha can guarantee a win by placing bets such that he cannot lose more than x times in a row. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins (s) that Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win, based on the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win (k) and the maximum number of consecutive losses (x).

The calculation of s is done by iterating x times, where in each iteration, the current value of s is increased by the minimum amount needed to guarantee a win in the next round. This is done by adding s // (k - 1) + 1 to s, which is the minimum amount needed to guarantee a win in the next round.

The program then checks if the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s. If it is, then Sasha can guarantee a win, and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly, calculates the value of s correctly, and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
