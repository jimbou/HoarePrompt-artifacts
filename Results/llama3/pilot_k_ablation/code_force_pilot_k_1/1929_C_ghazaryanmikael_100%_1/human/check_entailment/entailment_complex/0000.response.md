Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The variable `s` is used to calculate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row, and then wins once. The amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win is calculated as `s = 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `s // (k - 1)` is the amount of coins Sasha needs to bet in order to win `s` coins, and `+ 1` is the amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to place the bet.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise.

The time complexity of the program is O(t * x), where t is the number of test cases and x is the maximum number of consecutive losses. This is because the program processes each test case in O(x) time, and there are t test cases.

The space complexity of the program is O(1), because the program only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, `i`, and `_`.

Correctness: **True**
