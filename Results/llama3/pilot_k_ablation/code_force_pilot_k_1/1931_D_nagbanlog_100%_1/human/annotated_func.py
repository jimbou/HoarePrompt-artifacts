#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and a_i is a positive integer for all i.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0

    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` are the values from the last test case, or are undefined if the loop did not execute (i.e., if `test_cases` is empty).
    return results
    #The program returns a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains parameters n, x, and y, and an array of integers. It processes each test case, counting the number of pairs in the array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair based on modular arithmetic conditions. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
