Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`. `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `a_i` is a positive integer for all `i`. `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables and their values remain the same, and a new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list. The `test_cases` list and its structure, as well as the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a_i`, are unchanged.
