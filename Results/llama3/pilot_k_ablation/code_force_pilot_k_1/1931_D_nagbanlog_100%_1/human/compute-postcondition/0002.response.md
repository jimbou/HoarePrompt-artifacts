Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'], freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are determined by the values of `case['params'][0]`, `case['params'][1]`, and `case['params'][2]` respectively. The value of `a` is determined by the value of `case['array']`. The `freq` dictionary is initialized with a default value of 0, and `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.
