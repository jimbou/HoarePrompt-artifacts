To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `case` and the list `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the list has at least 1 test case, the loop executes. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
