To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must have at least 1 test case and `case` is the first test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
