You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and a_i is a positive integer for all i.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` are the values from the last test case, or are undefined if the loop did not execute (i.e., if `test_cases` is empty).
    return results
    #The program returns a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
