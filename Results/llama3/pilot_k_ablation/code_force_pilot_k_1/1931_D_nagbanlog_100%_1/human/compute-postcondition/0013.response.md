Functionality: **This function calculates the beautiful count for each test case in the provided list of test cases. It takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of integers and two integers x and y. The function returns a list of beautiful counts, where each count corresponds to a test case in the input list. The beautiful count is calculated by counting the number of pairs of integers in the test case that satisfy a certain modular arithmetic condition with respect to x and y. The function processes each test case independently and returns a list of beautiful counts with the same length as the input list of test cases.**
