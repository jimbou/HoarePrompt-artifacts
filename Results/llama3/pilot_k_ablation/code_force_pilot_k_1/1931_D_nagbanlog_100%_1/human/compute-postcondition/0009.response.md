Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a value from `case['params']`, `x` is a value from `case['params']`, `y` is a value from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are tuples of the form `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the values are the frequencies of these tuples in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the tuples `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` for all `num` in `a`.**
