Output State: **The program returns a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair.**

In this output state, the list `results` contains the count of pairs for each test case in the `test_cases` list. The count represents the number of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair. The values in the `results` list are calculated based on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` from each test case. If the `test_cases` list is empty, the `results` list will also be empty.
