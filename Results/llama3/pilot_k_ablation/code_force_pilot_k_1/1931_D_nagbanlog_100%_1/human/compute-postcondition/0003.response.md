According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, which is not guaranteed to have at least 1 element. So, `a` needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element and `num` is now the first element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element in `a`**
