According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `a` is case['array'] which is not guaranteed to have at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 element and the variable `num` is the first element in the list `a`. 

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is a value from case['params'], x is a value from case['params'], y is a value from case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list a, freq is an empty defaultdict, beautiful_count is 0**
