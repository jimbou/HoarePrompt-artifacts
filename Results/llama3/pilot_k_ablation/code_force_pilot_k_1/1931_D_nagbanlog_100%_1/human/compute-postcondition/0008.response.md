Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a value from `case['params']`, `x` is a value from `case['params']`, `y` is a value from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. The frequency of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary is increased by 1. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the frequency dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the frequency of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary is increased by 1, which means that the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the frequency dictionary is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still the same as in the initial state.
