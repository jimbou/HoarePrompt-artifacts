Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`, then the current value of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
