Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list of counts of pairs in each test case's array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` are the values from the last test case, or are undefined if the loop did not execute (i.e., if `test_cases` is empty).**
