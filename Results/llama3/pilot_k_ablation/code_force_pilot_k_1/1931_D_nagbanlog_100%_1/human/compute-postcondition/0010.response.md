Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the count of pairs in `a` that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are pairs of remainders modulo `x` and `y` and the values are the frequencies of these pairs in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the count of pairs in `a` that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair, `num` is the last element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `a` is empty, `freq` is an empty dictionary and `beautiful_count` is 0.**

The code appends the value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. The value of `beautiful_count` is the count of pairs in `a` that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
