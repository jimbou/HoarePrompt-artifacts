Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the beautiful count of the first test case, `n` is a value from `case['params']`, `x` is a value from `case['params']`, `y` is a value from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are tuples of the form `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the values are the frequencies of these tuples in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the tuples `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` for all `num` in `a`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the beautiful count of the first test case to the results list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The results list now contains the count of beautiful pairs for the first test case.
