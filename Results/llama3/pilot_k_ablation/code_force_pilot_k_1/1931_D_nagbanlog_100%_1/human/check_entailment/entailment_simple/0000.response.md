Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes the `test_cases` list as input and returns a list of counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.
3. Inside the function, it iterates over each test case and extracts the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
4. It initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
5. It then iterates over each number `num` in the array `a` and calculates its modulo values `mod_x` and `mod_y` with respect to `x` and `y` respectively.
6. It calculates the required modulo values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair with `num` a beautiful pair.
7. It checks if the required modulo values are already present in the `freq` dictionary. If they are, it increments the beautiful pair count `beautiful_count` by the frequency of the required modulo values.
8. It then increments the frequency of the current modulo values `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
9. Finally, it appends the beautiful pair count `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
10. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
