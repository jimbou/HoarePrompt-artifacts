Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2.  The `func_1` function iterates over each test case, calculates the beautiful pairs, and stores the count in the `results` list.
3.  The program uses a `defaultdict` to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values `(mod_x, mod_y)`. This allows it to efficiently count the beautiful pairs.
4.  The program correctly calculates the required modulo values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` for each number in the array.
5.  The program correctly increments the `beautiful_count` when it finds a pair of numbers that satisfy the conditions.
6.  The program returns the `results` list, which contains the beautiful count for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
