Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values (mod_x, mod_y) for each number in the array. It then iterates through the array, for each number, it calculates the required modulo values (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) that would make a pair with the current number. If the required modulo values are already in the dictionary, it increments the beautiful_count by the frequency of those modulo values. This is because all numbers with the same modulo values can form a beautiful pair with the current number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly calculates the modulo values, and it correctly increments the beautiful_count when it finds a pair of numbers that can form a beautiful pair. It also correctly handles the case when the required modulo values are not in the dictionary, in which case it simply increments the frequency of the current modulo values.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array, and it handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
