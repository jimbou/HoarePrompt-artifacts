Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency map to store the count of numbers with their respective modulo x and modulo y values. For each number, it calculates the required modulo x and modulo y values to form a beautiful pair and checks if such a pair exists in the frequency map. If it does, it increments the beautiful count. The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where x or y is 1, and the case where the array contains duplicate numbers.

The program also correctly handles the case where the required modulo x and modulo y values are the same as the current number's modulo x and modulo y values, which would result in a pair with the same number, but this is not considered a beautiful pair according to the problem description.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array, because it makes a single pass through the array. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the frequency map could store n entries.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem for all possible inputs.
