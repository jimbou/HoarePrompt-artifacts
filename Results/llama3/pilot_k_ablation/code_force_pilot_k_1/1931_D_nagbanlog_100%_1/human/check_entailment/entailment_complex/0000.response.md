Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2. The `func_1` function iterates over each test case, extracts the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
3. The function uses a `defaultdict` to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the array `a`.
4. For each number `num` in the array `a`, the function calculates the required modulo values `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` to form a "beautiful" pair.
5. The function checks if the required modulo values are already present in the `freq` dictionary. If they are, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of those values.
6. The function updates the frequency of the current modulo values `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
7. The function repeats steps 4-6 for all numbers in the array `a`.
8. The function appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
9. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the count of "beautiful" pairs for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of "beautiful" pairs in each test case's array based on the modular arithmetic conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
