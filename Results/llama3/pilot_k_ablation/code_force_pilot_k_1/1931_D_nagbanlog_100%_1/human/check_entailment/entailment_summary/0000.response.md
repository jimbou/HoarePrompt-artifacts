Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, as defined in the problem description. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of remainders modulo x and y, and then iterates over the array to count the number of beautiful pairs.

The program correctly handles the case where the required remainder modulo x is not the same as the remainder modulo x of the current number, by using the expression `(x - mod_x) % x` to calculate the required remainder modulo x.

The program also correctly handles the case where the required remainder modulo y is the same as the remainder modulo y of the current number, by using the expression `mod_y` to calculate the required remainder modulo y.

The program returns a list of beautiful counts, where each count corresponds to a test case in the input list of test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
