Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values for x and y, and then iterates through the array to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list of test cases is empty, returning an empty list. It also correctly handles the case where the array is empty, returning a count of 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
