This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains parameters n, x, and y, and an array of integers. It processes each test case, counting the number of pairs in the array that can be paired with another pair to form a "beautiful" pair based on modular arithmetic conditions. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
