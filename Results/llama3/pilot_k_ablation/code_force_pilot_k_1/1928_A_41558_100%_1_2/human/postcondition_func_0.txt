The function reads an integer n from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers a and b, representing the size of a rectangle. It then checks if the rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles by checking if either a or b is even, or if one is twice the other and the other is odd. If the rectangle can be divided, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If n is 0, no output is printed.
