Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers. Either `a` is even or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are even. The current value of `a` and `b` is such that either `a` divided by 2 equals `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` divided by 2 equals `a` and `a` is odd, and 'NO' is being printed**
