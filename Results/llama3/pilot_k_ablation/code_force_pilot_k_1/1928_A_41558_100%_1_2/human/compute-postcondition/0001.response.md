To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and we want the loop to execute at least once, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so we can set `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
