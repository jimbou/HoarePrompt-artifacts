Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are even, then if `a` divided by 2 equals `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` divided by 2 equals `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
