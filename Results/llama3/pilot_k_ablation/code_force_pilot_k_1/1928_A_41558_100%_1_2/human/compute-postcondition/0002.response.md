Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` to be integers, which are obtained from the input. The input is expected to contain two space-separated integers, which are split and converted to integers using the `int` function. The resulting integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`, respectively.
