Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) â€” the size of Bob's rectangle.**

In this output state, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. Each remaining test case still contains two integers `a` and `b`, both between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
