Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a and b are both even and a is not equal to b. For example, if a = 4 and b = 6, the program will print 'NO', but actually, Bob can cut the rectangle into two 2x6 rectangles and then form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if a or b is odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, but it does not consider the case when both a and b are even and a is not equal to b. To fix this, the program should also check if a and b are both even and a is not equal to b, and if so, print 'YES'.
