Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by checking the parity of the sides and the possibility of forming a different rectangle by cutting and rotating the original rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form a different rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.

2. If `a` is equal to `b` divided by 2 (or vice versa) and `b` (or `a`) is odd, it's not possible to form a different rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.

3. In all other cases, it's possible to form a different rectangle, so the program prints 'YES'.

This logic correctly covers all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
