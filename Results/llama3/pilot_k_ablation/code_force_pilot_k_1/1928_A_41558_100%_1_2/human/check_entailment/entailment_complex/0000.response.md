Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles. The program checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be divided into two equal smaller rectangles.
2. If one of `a` or `b` is twice the other and the other is odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be divided into two equal smaller rectangles.
3. In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because the rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles.

The program correctly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are equal, and where one is twice the other. It also correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, in which case no output is printed.

Correctness: **True**
