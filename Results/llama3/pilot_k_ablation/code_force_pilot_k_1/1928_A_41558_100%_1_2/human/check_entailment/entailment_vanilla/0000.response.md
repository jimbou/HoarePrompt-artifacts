Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then reformed into a different rectangle. The program takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input and checks the following conditions:

1. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.
2. If one dimension is half of the other and the other dimension is odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of the same size, which cannot be reformed into a different rectangle.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'YES' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and reformed into a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
