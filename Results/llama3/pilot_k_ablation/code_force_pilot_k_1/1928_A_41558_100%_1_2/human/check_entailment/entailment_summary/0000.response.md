Reasoning:
The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles. The conditions checked in the if-elif statements cover all possible cases where the rectangle cannot be divided into two equal smaller rectangles. If none of these conditions are met, the program correctly prints 'YES', indicating that the rectangle can be divided. The program also handles the case where n is 0, in which case no output is printed.

Correctness: **True**
