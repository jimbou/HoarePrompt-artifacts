The function reads input from stdin, processes it line by line, and prints output. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). For each line, it calculates the value of (a - (b+c)//3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to (b+c)%3, or -1 if c is less than (b+c)%3, and prints the result. The function does not return any value, but instead, prints the output directly.
