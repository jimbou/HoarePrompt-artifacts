Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. It first calculates the total number of extroverts and universals, and then checks if the number of universals is sufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If not, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed by adding the number of introverts to the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3 (since each tent can accommodate up to 3 people).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of universals is not sufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts, and where the number of introverts is greater than the total number of extroverts and universals.
