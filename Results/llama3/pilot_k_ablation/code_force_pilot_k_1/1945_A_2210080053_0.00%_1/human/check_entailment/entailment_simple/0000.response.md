Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, skipping the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and then iterating over the remaining lines, each containing three integers a, b, and c.

2. Inside the loop, the program correctly calculates the total number of extroverts and universals (q) by adding b and c.

3. The program then calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It does this by subtracting the number of introverts (p) from the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3 (q // 3). This is because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people, and each extrovert wants to live with two others.

4. However, if the number of universals (r) is less than the remainder of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3 (q % 3), it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, and the program outputs -1.

5. Otherwise, the program outputs the calculated minimum number of tents.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where there are no introverts, extroverts, or universals.

Correctness: **True**
