Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases, and then iterating over the remaining lines, each containing three integers a, b, and c.

2. For each test case, the program correctly calculates the total number of people who want to live in a tent with two others (extroverts and universals) by adding q and r.

3. The program then checks if the number of universals (r) is less than the remainder of the total number of people who want to live in a tent with two others (q) divided by 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, so the program prints -1.

4. If the condition is false, the program calculates the minimum number of tents needed by subtracting the number of people who want to live in a tent with two others (q) divided by 3 from the number of introverts (p). This is because each introvert needs a separate tent, and the remaining people can be accommodated in tents with two others.

5. The program uses a tuple to print either the calculated minimum number of tents or -1, depending on the condition.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
