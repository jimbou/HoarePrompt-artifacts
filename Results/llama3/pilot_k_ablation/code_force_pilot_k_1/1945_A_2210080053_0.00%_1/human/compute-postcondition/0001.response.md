The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `p`, `q`, and `r` from the second line in `stdin`, which contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The second line increments the value of `q` by the value of `r`.

Output State: **p is a, q is b + c, r is c, stdin contains at least one line**
