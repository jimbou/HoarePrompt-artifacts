Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), p is the last a, q is the last b + c, r is the last c, and the output contains t lines, each containing either (a - (b+c)//3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to (b+c)%3, or -1 if c is less than (b+c)%3 for each line of input.**
