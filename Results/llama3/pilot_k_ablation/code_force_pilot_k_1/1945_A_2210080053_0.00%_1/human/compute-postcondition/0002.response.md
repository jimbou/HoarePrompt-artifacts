The code prints a tuple containing the value of `p - q // 3` and `-1`. The value of `p - q // 3` is the difference between the integer `p` and the integer division of `q` by 3. The value of `-1` is a constant. The expression `r < q % 3` is a conditional statement that evaluates to `True` if `r` is less than the remainder of `q` divided by 3, and `False` otherwise. If the condition is `True`, the first element of the tuple is printed, otherwise the second element is printed.
Output: **(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]**
