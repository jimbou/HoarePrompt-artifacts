To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the expression inside the `print` function step by step, considering the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `p` is `a`.
   - `q` is `b + c`.
   - `r` is `c`.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `q // 3`: This is the integer division of `q` by 3. Since `q` is `b + c`, this operation results in the integer part of the division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3.
   - `q % 3`: This gives the remainder of `q` divided by 3. Since `q` is `b + c`, this operation results in the remainder of the sum of `b` and `c` divided by 3.
   - `r < q % 3`: This is a conditional statement checking if `r` (which is `c`) is less than the remainder of `q` (which is `b + c`) divided by 3.
   - `(p - q // 3, -1)`: This is a tuple containing two values. The first value is the result of subtracting the integer division of `q` by 3 from `p`. The second value is `-1`.
   - `[(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]]`: This uses the result of the conditional statement `r < q % 3` as an index into the tuple. If `r < q % 3` is `True`, it selects the first element of the tuple (`p - q // 3`). If `r < q % 3` is `False`, it selects the second element of the tuple (`-1`).

Given the initial state, the exact numerical values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided. However, we can describe the output based on the operations performed:

- If `c` (which is `r`) is less than the remainder of `(b + c)` divided by 3, the output will be the result of `a - (b + c) // 3`.
- If `c` is not less than the remainder of `(b + c)` divided by 3, the output will be `-1`.

Therefore, the output depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it can be described as follows:

Output: **a - (b + c) // 3 if c < (b + c) % 3, otherwise -1**
