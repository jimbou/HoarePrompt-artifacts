The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and the file object `open(0)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object `open(0)` has at least 2 lines the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. So for the loop to be executed  the file object `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines and the line is the second line.
