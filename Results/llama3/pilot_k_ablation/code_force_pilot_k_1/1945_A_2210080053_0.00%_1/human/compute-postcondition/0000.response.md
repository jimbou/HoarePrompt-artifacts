To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the file object `0` (which represents standard input, `stdin`), and the variable `line`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the content of `stdin`. The loop will iterate over the lines in `stdin`, excluding the first line. For the loop to execute, `stdin` must contain at least two lines: the first line with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), and at least one more line with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).

At the start of the loop, `line` should be the second line in `stdin`, which contains the first set of three integers `a`, `b`, `c`.

State: **`stdin` contains at least two lines, the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), and the second line contains three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `line` is the second line in `stdin`**
