Output State: **The program returns the number of elements in the list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the (bit-1)-th bit position.**

This output state is calculated based on the initial state, where `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the bit-th bit position, and `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr` and its current value is not -1. The function `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)` is called, which will return the number of elements in the list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the (bit-1)-th bit position.
