Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`. The current value of `xor` has a 0 bit at the position specified by `bit`.**
