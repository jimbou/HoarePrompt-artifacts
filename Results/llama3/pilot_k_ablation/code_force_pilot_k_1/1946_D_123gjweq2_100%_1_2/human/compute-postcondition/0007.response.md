Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr, xor is 0, i is the first element in cur_arr.**

The first line appends the value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `xor` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` now contains this element. The second line assigns 0 to `xor`, changing its value from the first element in `cur_arr` to 0. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
