To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must have at least one element. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `cur_arr` to reflect this requirement.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`**
