Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the bit-th bit position. If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`.***
