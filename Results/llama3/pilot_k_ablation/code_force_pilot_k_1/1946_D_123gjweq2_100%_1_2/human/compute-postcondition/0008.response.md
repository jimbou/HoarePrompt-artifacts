Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit-th bit of the first element in `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0 if the bit-th bit of the first element in `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `xor` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`.***
