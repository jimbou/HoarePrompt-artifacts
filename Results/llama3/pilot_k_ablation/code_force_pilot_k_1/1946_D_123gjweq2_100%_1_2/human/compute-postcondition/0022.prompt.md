You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30.
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list `cur_arr`.
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30. Additionally, bit is not equal to -1.

If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list `cur_arr`.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between thing1 and the result of find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1). thing1 is either -1 or the number of elements in new_arr, which contains all the elements of cur_arr that have a 0 in the bit-th bit position. The bit-th bit of x is 1.

Case_3: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the bit-th bit position. The bit-th bit of `x` is 0. `thing1` is equal to -1.

Case_4: The program returns -1, which is the value of `thing1`.
