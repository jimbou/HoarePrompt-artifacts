The code `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` (which is 0) and the value of `i` (which is the first element in `cur_arr`). The result of this operation is assigned back to `xor`.

Since `xor` was initially 0, the result of the XOR operation will be equal to the value of `i`. Therefore, the new value of `xor` will be the first element in `cur_arr`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`.**
