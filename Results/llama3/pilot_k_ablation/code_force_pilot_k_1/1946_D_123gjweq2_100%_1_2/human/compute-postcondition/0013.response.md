Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the bit-th bit position, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the number of elements in `new_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code assigns the length of `new_arr` to `thing1`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, `new_arr`, and `xor` remain unchanged. The new variable `thing1` is introduced, which holds the count of elements in `new_arr`.
