Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `cur_arr` that have a 0 in the bit-th bit position, `xor` is an integer such that the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `thing1` which is assigned the value -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
