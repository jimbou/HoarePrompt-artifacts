Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in an array such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to a given number x. The program provided uses a recursive approach to solve this problem.

Function 1, `func_1`, simply calls Function 2, `find_new`, with the initial array and the maximum bit position (30).

Function 2, `find_new`, works as follows:

- If the current bit position is -1, it means that all bits have been processed, and the function returns the length of the current array, which represents the maximum number of segments found.

- Otherwise, it iterates over the current array, calculating the XOR of the elements. Whenever the XOR is not set at the current bit position, it adds the XOR to a new array and resets the XOR.

- After processing the entire array, if the XOR is still set at the current bit position, it means that the current bit position cannot be used to split the array into segments, and the function returns -1.

- If the current bit position is set in the given number x, the function returns the maximum of the current number of segments and the result of recursively calling itself with the same array and the next bit position.

- If the current bit position is not set in x, but the current number of segments is not -1, the function recursively calls itself with the new array and the next bit position.

- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns -1.

The program correctly implements the required logic and handles all possible cases. It uses a recursive approach to find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
