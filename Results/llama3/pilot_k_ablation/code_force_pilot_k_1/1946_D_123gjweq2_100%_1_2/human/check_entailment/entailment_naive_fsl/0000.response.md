Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `find_new` recursively tries to divide the array into segments such that the bitwise XOR of each segment does not have a 1 in the current bit position. If it is possible to divide the array into segments without having a 1 in the current bit position, it recursively tries to divide the new segments. If it is not possible to divide the array into segments without having a 1 in the current bit position, it tries to divide the array without considering the current bit position. The function `func_1` simply calls `find_new` with the initial array and the most significant bit position.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where it is not possible to divide the array into segments that meet the condition, in which case it returns -1. It also correctly handles the case where the array can be divided into segments that meet the condition, in which case it returns the maximum number of segments.

I have not been able to find any case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
