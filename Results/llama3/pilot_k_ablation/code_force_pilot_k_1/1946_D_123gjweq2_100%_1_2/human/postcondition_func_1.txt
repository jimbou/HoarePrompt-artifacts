This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` between 0 and 30, and a non-negative integer `x` less than 2^30 as input. It performs bitwise operations on the elements of `cur_arr` based on the value of `bit` and `x`. The function returns the number of elements in `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the number of elements in a new list `new_arr` (containing elements of `cur_arr` with a 0 in the `bit`-th bit position) and the result of a recursive call to the function with `bit - 1` if the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1. If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 0, the function returns the result of a recursive call to the function with `bit - 1` and the new list `new_arr` if `thing1` is not -1. In all other cases, the function returns -1.
