Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, i is at least 1, a is a list of at least one integer with its maximum value removed, b is a list of integers with a length equal to the minimum of n and len(a) - 1, with its minimum value removed, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the original maximum value of a and the original minimum value of b.**

The code first appends the absolute difference between the maximum value of `a` and the minimum value of `b` to the `result` list. Then, it removes the maximum value from `a` and the minimum value from `b`. The length of `b` is reduced by 1, and the maximum value is removed from `a`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
