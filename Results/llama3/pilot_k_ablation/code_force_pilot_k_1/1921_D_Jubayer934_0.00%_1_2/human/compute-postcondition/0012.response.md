The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value of the original list `a` and the minimum value of the original list `b` at each iteration.
Since both `a` and `b` are empty lists, the maximum value of `a` and the minimum value of `b` are undefined.
However, since `result` is a list of `i` integers, where `i` is the minimum of the original lengths of `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are empty, `i` is 0.
Therefore, `result` is an empty list, and the sum of its elements is 0.
Output: **0**
