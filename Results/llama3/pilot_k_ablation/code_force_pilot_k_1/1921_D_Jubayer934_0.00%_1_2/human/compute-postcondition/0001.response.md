To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, as it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains one integer m (1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
