Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, `b` is sorted in ascending order. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
