Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains one integer m (1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, as it was assigned the value of the first integer from the input. The stdin now contains two lines for each test case: the first line contains one integer `m`, and the second line contains `m` integers `b_i`. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
