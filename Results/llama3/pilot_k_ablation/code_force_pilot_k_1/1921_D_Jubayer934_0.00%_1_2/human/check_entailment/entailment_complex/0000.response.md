Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is trying to solve the problem by calculating the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value of `a` and the minimum value of `b` at each iteration. However, this approach is not correct.

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference `D` that can be obtained by arranging the elements of `b` in a certain order to make the array as different as possible from `a`. The program's approach does not consider the arrangement of elements in `b` and simply calculates the sum of absolute differences between the maximum value of `a` and the minimum value of `b` at each iteration.

A correct approach would be to sort both `a` and `b` and then calculate the sum of absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` in reverse order. This would ensure that the maximum total difference `D` is obtained.

Correctness: **False**
