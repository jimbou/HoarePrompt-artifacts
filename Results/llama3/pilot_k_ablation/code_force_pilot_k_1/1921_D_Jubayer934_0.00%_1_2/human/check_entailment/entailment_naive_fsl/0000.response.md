Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3 4
1 1 1
1 1 1 1

The program will output 0, but the correct output should be 0 because the maximum total difference D that can be obtained is indeed 0.

However, if the input is:

2 6
5 8
8 7 5 8 2 10

The program will output 11, but the correct output should be 12. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum total difference D when the array b has more elements than the array a.

The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the array b. It removes the middle element of the array b, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to remove the maximum and minimum elements from the array b alternately, and calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the array a and the remaining elements of the array b.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.
