The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value of `a` and the minimum value of `b` at each iteration, after removing the maximum value from `a` and the minimum value from `b` in each iteration, until `a` and `b` are empty. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.
