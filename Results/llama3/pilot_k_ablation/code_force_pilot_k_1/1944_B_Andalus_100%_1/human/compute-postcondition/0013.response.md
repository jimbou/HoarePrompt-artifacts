Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is 1. If the first two elements of `lft` are equal, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` and `sng` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list and `sng` is a list containing the first two elements of `lft`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`.**
