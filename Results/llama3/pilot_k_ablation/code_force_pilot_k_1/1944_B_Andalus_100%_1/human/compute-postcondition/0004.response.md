Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the smallest integer in lft.**

The code appends the first element of the sorted list `lft` to the list `sng`. Since `lft` is a sorted list, the first element is the smallest integer in `lft`. The other variables remain unchanged.
