Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `i` is 1, `rdb` is a list of integers that contains at least one element equal to `rgt[i]` (which is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`), and the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the current value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Since the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, the list `rdb` now contains at least one element equal to `rgt[i]` (which is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
