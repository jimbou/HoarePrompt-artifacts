The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Since `i` is 1 and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, the value appended to `rdb` is the same as the value at index 0 of `rgt`.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing the value at index 0 of `rgt`, `i` is 1.**
