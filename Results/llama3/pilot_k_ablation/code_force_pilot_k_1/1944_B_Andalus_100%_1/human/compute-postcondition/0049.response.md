Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is at most 2 * k, and if 2 * k - sz >= 2 for all elements in `rdb`, then all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end, otherwise, only some elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.**
