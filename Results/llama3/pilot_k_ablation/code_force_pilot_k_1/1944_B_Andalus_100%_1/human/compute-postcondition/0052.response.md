Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft` that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is at least 2 * k, and if 2 * k - sz >= 2 for all elements in `rdb`, then all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end, otherwise, only some elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the current loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, but the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
