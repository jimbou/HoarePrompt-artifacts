Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate) and must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is a multiple of 2 and is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`. If `n` is 1, the current value of `rdb` is an empty list. If `ldb` is empty, the current value of `sz` is either 0 or 1, and `elem` is the first element in `sng`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables maintain their initial values and properties, and no new variables are introduced.
