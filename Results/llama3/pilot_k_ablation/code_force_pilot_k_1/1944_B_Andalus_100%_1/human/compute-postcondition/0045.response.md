Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one duplicate element, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `rdb` is a non-empty list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is 2, and if `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. If `ldb` is empty, `sz` is either 0 or 1, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. The current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 is no longer valid, but the condition that `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0 is still valid.
