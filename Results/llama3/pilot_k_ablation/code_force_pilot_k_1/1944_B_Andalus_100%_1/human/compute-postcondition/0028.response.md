Postcondition: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft` that must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`. If `2 * k - sz` is at least 2, then `sz` is 2, and the first element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, if `2 * k - sz` is less than 2, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
