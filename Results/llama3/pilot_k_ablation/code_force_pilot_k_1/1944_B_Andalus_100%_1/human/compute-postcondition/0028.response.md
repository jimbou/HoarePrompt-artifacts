Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate) and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `rdb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is either 0 or 2, `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`. If `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. If `2 * k - sz` is at least 2, then `sz` is 2. Otherwise, `sz` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
