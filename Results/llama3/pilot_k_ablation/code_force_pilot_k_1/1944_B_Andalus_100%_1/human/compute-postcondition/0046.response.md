Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one duplicate element, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `rdb` is a non-empty list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is 0, and if `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. If `ldb` is empty, `sz` is either 0 or 1, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. Additionally, 2 times `k` minus `sz` is less than 2***
