Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `i` is 1. If the value at index `i` of `rgt` is equal to the value at index `i-1` of `rgt`, then `rdb` is a list containing the value at index 0 of `rgt`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains an empty list.***
