To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt` that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and `sz` is 0, and nothing is printed.**
