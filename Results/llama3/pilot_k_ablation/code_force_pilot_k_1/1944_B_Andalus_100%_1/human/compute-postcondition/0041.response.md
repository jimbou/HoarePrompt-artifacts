To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `elem` and the list `rdb`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `rdb` is not empty, i.e., it contains at least one element.
2. Since `rdb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), we can infer that `rgt` must have at least one duplicate element for `rdb` to be non-empty.
3. The variable `elem` will take on the value of the first element in `rdb` during the first iteration of the loop.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one duplicate element, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `rdb` is a non-empty list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is 0, and if `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. If `ldb` is empty, `sz` is either 0 or 1, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`**

Note that we've added the condition that `rgt` must have at least one duplicate element, and we've also specified that `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.
