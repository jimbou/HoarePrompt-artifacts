Postcondition: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer that is at least 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, i is 1. The first two elements of lft are the same. If the first two elements of lft are the same, sng is an empty list. The current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1.**
