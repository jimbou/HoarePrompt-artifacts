Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is 0, and nothing is printed.**

The code only introduces a new variable `sz` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
