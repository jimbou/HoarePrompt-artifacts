Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`. If `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. `sz` is at most `2 * k` and is even. If `2 * k` is greater than or equal to the length of `ldb` multiplied by 2, then `sz` is equal to the length of `ldb` multiplied by 2 and all elements of `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, `sz` is less than the length of `ldb` multiplied by 2 and only some elements of `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between.**
