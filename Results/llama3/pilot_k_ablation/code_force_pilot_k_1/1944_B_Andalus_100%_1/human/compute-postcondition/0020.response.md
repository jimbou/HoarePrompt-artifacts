Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is 0. If `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the addition of a new variable `sz` which is assigned the value 0. The conditions and relationships between the variables from the initial state are still valid.
