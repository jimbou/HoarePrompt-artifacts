Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, stdin contains no input.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `lst`. The list is then split into two parts: `lft` contains the first `n` elements, and `rgt` contains the remaining elements. Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted in ascending order. The variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The values of `T` and `_` remain unchanged. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty, as all input has been read.
