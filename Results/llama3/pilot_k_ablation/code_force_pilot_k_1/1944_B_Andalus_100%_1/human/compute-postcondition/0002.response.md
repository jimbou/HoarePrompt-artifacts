Output State: **T is a positive integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `n, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `n` and `k` are also integers. Stdin now contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.

2. `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to `lst`. Stdin is now empty.

3. `lft = lst[:n]` and `rgt = lst[n:]`: These lines split the list `lst` into two parts: `lft` contains the first `n` elements, and `rgt` contains the remaining elements.

4. `ldb = []`, `rdb = []`, and `sng = []`: These lines initialize three empty lists: `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`.

5. `lft.sort()` and `rgt.sort()`: These lines sort the lists `lft` and `rgt` in ascending order.

After executing the entire code block, the final state is as follows:

* `T` remains a positive integer that must be at least 1, as it is not modified by the code.
* `_` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code.
* `n` and `k` are integers, assigned from the input.
* `lst` is a list of integers, assigned from the input.
* `lft` and `rgt` are sorted lists of integers, split from `lst`.
* `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are empty lists.
* Stdin is empty, as all inputs have been read.

Note that the values of `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` are not specified, as they depend on the input provided. However, their types and relationships are defined in the output state.
