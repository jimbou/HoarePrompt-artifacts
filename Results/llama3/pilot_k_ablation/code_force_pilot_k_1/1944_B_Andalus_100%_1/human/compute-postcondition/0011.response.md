Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer that is at least 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, i is 1, sng is a list containing the current element of lft at index i.**

The code appends the current element of lft at index i to the list sng. The value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1. Therefore, the element appended to sng is the current element of lft at index i. The other variables remain unchanged.
