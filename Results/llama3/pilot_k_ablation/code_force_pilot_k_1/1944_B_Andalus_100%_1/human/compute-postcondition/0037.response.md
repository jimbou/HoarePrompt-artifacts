Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`. If `sz` is less than 2 * k, `sz` is increased by the number of single elements in `sng` and all single elements in `sng` are printed. If `sz` is at least 2 * k, `sz` remains the same and only some single elements in `sng` are printed.**
