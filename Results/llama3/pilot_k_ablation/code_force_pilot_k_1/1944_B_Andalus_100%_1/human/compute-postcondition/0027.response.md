Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements from lft that must have at least 1 element, sng is a list containing all the single elements from lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements from rgt, sz is 0, elem is the first element in ldb, and 2 * k - sz is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
