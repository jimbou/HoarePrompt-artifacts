Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate) and must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is a multiple of 2 and is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`. If `n` is 1, the current value of `rdb` is an empty list. If `ldb` is empty, the current value of `sz` is either 0 or 1, and `elem` is the first element in `sng`.**
