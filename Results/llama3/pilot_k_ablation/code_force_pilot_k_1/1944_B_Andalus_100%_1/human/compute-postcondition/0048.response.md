Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt` that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is 2, and the first element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, nothing is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
