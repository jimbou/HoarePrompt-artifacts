The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
