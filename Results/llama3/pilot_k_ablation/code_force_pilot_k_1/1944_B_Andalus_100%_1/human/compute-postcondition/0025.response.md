Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft` that must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. The current value of `2 * k - sz` is at least 0, and the first element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `2 * k - sz` is at least 0, since `sz` is now 2 and `k` is an integer. The first element of `ldb`, which is `elem`, is still printed twice with a space in between.
