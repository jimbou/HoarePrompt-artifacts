Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate) and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `rdb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`. If `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. The current value of `2 * k - sz` is at least 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, resulting in `sz` being 2. The current value of `2 * k - sz` is at least 0, since `2 * k - sz` was at least 2 before the increment and `sz` has increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
