The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer in the input is read and assigned to `T`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n.**
