Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), and `k` is between 1 and the floor of `n/2` (inclusive). The second line of each test case contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`, where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and every integer from 1 to `n` occurs exactly twice in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
