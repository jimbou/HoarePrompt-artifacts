To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, and `sz` is at most `2 * k` and is even, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to ensure it has at least 1 element.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 single element from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is at most `2 * k` and is even, `elem` is the first single element in `sng`**
