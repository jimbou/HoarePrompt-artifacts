Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 single element from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `elem` is the first single element in `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is at least 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the first single element from `lft` which is `elem` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of `sz` being at least 2 * k. If this condition is met, the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the first single element from `lft`, which is `elem`, is printed.
