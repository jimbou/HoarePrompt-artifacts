To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute.

Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate). If `n` is 1, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial state.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1, and `i` should be 1 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate), `i` is 1**
