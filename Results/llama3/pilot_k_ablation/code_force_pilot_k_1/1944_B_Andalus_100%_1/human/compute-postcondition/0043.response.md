The code prints the first element of `rdb` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end. The first element of `rdb` is `elem`. Since `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt` that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is a duplicate element from `rgt`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element in the list rdb)**
