Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sng` is a list of integers that contains all the non-duplicate elements from `lft` (including the first occurrence of each duplicate) and must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list of integers that contains all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` (excluding the first occurrence of each duplicate), `sz` is a multiple of 2 and is incremented by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `n` is 1, `rdb` is an empty list. If `ldb` is empty, `sz` is either 1 or 2, and `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and the first element in `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the value of `sz` incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
