Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 single element from `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is even and is at least 2 * k, `elem` is the first single element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
