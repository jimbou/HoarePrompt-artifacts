Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is 1, The first two elements of `lft` are equal, `sng` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated to contain the second element of `lft`, which is equal to the first element of `lft` since the first two elements of `lft` are equal. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
