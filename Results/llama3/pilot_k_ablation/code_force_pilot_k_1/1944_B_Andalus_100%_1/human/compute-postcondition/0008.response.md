Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer that is at least 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i], rdb is an empty list, i is 1. If the first two elements of lft are different, sng is a list containing the smallest integer in lft. Otherwise, sng is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to include the current value of lft[i], which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
