To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to have at least 1 element.

Additionally, since `elem` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to be the first element in the list `sng`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements from `lft` that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is at most 2 * k, and if 2 * k - sz >= 2 for all elements in `rdb`, then all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end, otherwise, only some elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end, `elem` is the first element in `sng`.**
