Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that `l` is a subset of the first half of the input array, `r` is a subset of the second half of the input array, and the bitwise XOR of elements of `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`.

The program first separates the input array into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, and then categorizes the elements of `lft` into three groups: `ldb` (left doubles), `rdb` (right doubles), and `sng` (singles). It then prints out a subset of these integers, prioritizing doubles and then singles, until it reaches a total count of `2k` for each test case.

The program correctly handles the cases where `k` is less than or equal to `n/2`, and it also correctly handles the cases where `n` is even or odd.

Correctness: **True**
