Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

4
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6

The program will output:

1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6

However, the problem statement requires that the two arrays l and r should have a bitwise XOR of elements equal to each other. In this case, the bitwise XOR of the elements in the first array is 0 (1^2^3^4^5^6 = 0), but the bitwise XOR of the elements in the second array is also 0 (1^2^3^4^5^6 = 0). This is not a valid solution because the problem statement requires that the bitwise XOR of the elements in the two arrays should be equal, but not necessarily 0.

The program does not handle this case correctly because it simply prints all the single elements in the left and right arrays without considering the bitwise XOR condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
