Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by first separating the input array into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, and then sorting them. It then identifies the single and double elements in `lft` and stores them in `sng` and `ldb` respectively. It also identifies the double elements in `rgt` and stores them in `rdb`. 

The program then constructs the two arrays `l` and `r` by first using the double elements from `ldb` and `rdb` and then using the single elements from `sng`. This ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. 

The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of double elements in `lft` or `rgt`, by using the single elements from `sng` to fill up the remaining space in `l` and `r`. 

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
