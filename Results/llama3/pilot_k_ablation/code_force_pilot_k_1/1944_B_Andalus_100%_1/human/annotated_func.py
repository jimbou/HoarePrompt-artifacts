#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    T = int(input())

        if lft[0] != lft[1]:
            sng.append(lft[0])
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
                ldb.append(lft[i])
            elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

            if 2 * k - sz >= 2:

    #State: `T` is 0, `_` is `T`, `n` is undefined, `k` is undefined, `lst` is undefined, `lft` is undefined, `rgt` is undefined, `ldb` is undefined, `sng` is undefined, `rdb` is undefined, `sz` is undefined.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the integers, separating them into two lists (left and right), and further categorizes them into three groups: pairs of identical integers (ldb and rdb), single integers (sng), and integers that appear only once in the list (sng). It then prints out a sequence of integers, where pairs of identical integers are printed together, followed by single integers, until a total of 2k integers have been printed. This process is repeated for both the left and right lists. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to standard output.
