Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines for each test case, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, st is an empty set**.

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two lines, this line consumes the first line of a test case, leaving the rest of the test cases and the second line of the current test case in stdin. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5.

The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, separated by spaces, and assigns it to `arr`. This line consumes the second line of the current test case, leaving the rest of the test cases in stdin. The list `arr` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9.

The third line creates an empty set and assigns it to `st`. This line does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`, but introduces a new variable `st` with an empty set value.

Overall, the code consumes two lines from stdin for each test case, assigns the first line to `n` and the second line to `arr`, and creates an empty set `st`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.
