The code prints the elements of the set `st` in descending order. Since `st` contains elements of the form `arr[i] + i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the printed elements will be the largest `n` values of the form `arr[i] + i + 1` in descending order.

Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing n elements which are `arr[i] + i + 1` for all i from 0 to n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines for each test case, and the elements of the set `st` in descending order are being printed**
