Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by reading the input, creating a set of elements by adding each integer with its 1-based index plus one, and printing the elements of the set in descending order. The use of a set ensures that duplicate elements are removed, and the sorted function with the reverse=True argument ensures that the elements are printed in descending order.

Correctness: **True**
