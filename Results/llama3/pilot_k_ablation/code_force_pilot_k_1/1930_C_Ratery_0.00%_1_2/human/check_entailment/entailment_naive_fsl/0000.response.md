Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, creates a set to store unique elements, and then iterates over the array, adding each element plus its index plus one to the set. Finally, it prints the elements of the set in decreasing order.

The program works correctly because it follows the problem description exactly. It selects an index, inserts the corresponding element plus the index plus one into the set, and then deletes the element from the array. This process is repeated n times, where n is the length of the array.

The use of a set ensures that only unique elements are stored, which is in line with the problem description. The sorting of the set in decreasing order before printing also matches the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including the case where the array has only one element, or where the array has duplicate elements. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
