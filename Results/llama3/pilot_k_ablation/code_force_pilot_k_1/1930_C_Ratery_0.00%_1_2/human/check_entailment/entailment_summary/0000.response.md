Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by creating a set of elements where each element is the sum of the corresponding element in the input array and its 1-based index plus one. The program then prints the elements of the set in descending order, which corresponds to the lexicographically largest array b that can be constructed.

The program uses a set to automatically eliminate duplicate elements, which is in line with the problem description. The use of the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument ensures that the elements are printed in descending order.

The program also correctly handles the 1-based indexing mentioned in the problem description by adding 1 to the index `i` when calculating the sum `arr[i] + i + 1`.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
