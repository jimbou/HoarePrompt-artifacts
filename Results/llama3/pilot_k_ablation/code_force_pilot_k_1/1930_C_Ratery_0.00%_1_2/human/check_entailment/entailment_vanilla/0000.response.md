Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program iterates over each test case using a for loop, which is correct.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself, which is also correct.

3. It then creates an empty set `st` to store unique elements. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the set `S` is not a multiset, meaning it can only contain unique elements.

4. The program then iterates over the array `arr` and adds each element `arr[i]` plus its index `i` plus 1 to the set `st`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the operation involves inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

5. After all elements have been added to the set `st`, the program sorts the set in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the array `b` should be sorted in decreasing order.

6. Finally, the program prints the sorted set `st` using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the set into separate arguments. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the output should be the lexicographically largest `b` that can be constructed.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program adds 1 to the index `i` when calculating `arr[i] + i + 1`. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the operation involves inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`, not `a_i + i + 1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
