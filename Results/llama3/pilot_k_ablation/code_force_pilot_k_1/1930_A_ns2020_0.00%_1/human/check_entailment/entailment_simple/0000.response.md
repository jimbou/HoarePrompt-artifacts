Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads `2n` integers into a list `A`.

3. The key insight here is that to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest possible number from the remaining numbers on the whiteboard. This is because the score is increased by the minimum of the two chosen numbers.

4. The program sorts the list `A` in ascending order by using the slice `A[::2]`. This slice starts from the beginning of the list and takes every second element, effectively sorting the list in ascending order.

5. The program then calculates the sum of the sorted list `A[::2]` and prints it. This sum represents the maximum final score that can be achieved.

6. The loop then decrements `t` by 1 and repeats the process until `t` is 0.

7. After the loop finishes, the program terminates, and the state of the program is as described in the annotated program.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
