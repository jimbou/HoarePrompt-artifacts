Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding min(x, y) to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program sorts the input integers in ascending order and then calculates the sum of every other integer, starting from the first. This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score.

The program correctly implements this strategy and produces the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
