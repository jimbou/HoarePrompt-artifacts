Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer, A is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines, the first line of the next test case is waiting to be read.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The code reads the second line of the first test case and assigns its integer value to `n`. Then, it reads the third line of the first test case, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to `A`. After executing the code, stdin contains one less test case, with the first line of the next test case waiting to be read.
