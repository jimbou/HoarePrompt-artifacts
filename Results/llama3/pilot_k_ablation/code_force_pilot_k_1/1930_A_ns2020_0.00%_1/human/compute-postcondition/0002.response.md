Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, A is a list of 2n integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 50, `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 50. The second line assigns to `A` a list of `2n` integers from stdin. Since `n` is between 1 and 50, `A` becomes a list of `2n` integers. Stdin now contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) followed by `2n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7).
