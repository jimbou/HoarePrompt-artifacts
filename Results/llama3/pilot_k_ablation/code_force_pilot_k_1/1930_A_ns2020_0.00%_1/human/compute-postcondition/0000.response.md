The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line of the first test case has been read, and the second line of the first test case is waiting to be read.**
