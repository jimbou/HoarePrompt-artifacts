Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (between 1 and 50) followed by `2n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (between 1 and 10^7).
