The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` was greater than 0, so the new value of `t` is greater than or equal to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed**
