Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive), n is an integer, A is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines, the first line of the next test case is waiting to be read, and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is being printed**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 49 (inclusive). The values of n and A remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines, and the first line of the next test case is waiting to be read. Additionally, the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is still being printed.
