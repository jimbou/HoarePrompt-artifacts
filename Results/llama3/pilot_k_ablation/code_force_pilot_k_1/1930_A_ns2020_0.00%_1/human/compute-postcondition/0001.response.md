To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is simply `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive),
- stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) followed by `2n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7).

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` are necessary.

However, to adhere strictly to the task's requirement for the format and to emphasize that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we can rephrase the state of `t` to make this explicit, even though the original range already implies this.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) followed by `2n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7).**
