Output: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, A is a list of 2n integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed**
