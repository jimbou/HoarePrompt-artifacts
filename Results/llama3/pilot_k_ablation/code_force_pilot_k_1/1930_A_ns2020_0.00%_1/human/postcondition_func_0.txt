The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of every other element in the list of integers, starting from the first element, for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
