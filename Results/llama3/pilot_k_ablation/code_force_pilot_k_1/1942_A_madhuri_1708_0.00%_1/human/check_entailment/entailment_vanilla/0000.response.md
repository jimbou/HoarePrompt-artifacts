Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by considering two cases:

1. When `k` is greater than or equal to 2:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`. This is incorrect because it doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted. For example, when `n = k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` has 3 sorted cyclic shifts, not 2.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is not equal to `k`.

2. When `k` is less than 2 (i.e., `k` is 1):
   - It prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is equal to its index. This is incorrect because it doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted. For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has 1 sorted cyclic shift, but the array `[2, 1, 0]` also has 1 sorted cyclic shift, which is not the desired output.

The correct approach would be to handle the cases differently. When `k` is 1, we can create an array where the first `n-1` elements are in increasing order, and the last element is smaller than the first element. This ensures that only one cyclic shift is sorted. When `k` is greater than 1, we can create an array where all elements are equal, which ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.

Correctness: **False**
