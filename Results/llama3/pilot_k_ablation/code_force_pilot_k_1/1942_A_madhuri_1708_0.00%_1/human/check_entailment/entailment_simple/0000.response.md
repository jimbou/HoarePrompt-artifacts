Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted. If `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints -1, which is also correct because it's impossible to have more than one sorted cyclic shift when `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is greater than `k`.
*   The program correctly handles the case where `k` is less than 2. It prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, which is a valid solution because only the original array (not any cyclic shifts) is sorted.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces valid output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
