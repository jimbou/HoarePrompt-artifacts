Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input and splits it into `n` and `k` for each test case.
* The program handles the case where `k >= 2` correctly. If `n == k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted. If `n != k`, it prints `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to have more than one sorted cyclic shift for an array of length `n` when `k >= 2`.
* The program handles the case where `k < 2` correctly. It prints the numbers from `0` to `n-1`, which is a valid solution because only one cyclic shift of this array is sorted (the one that starts with the smallest element).

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
