Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1, which is not a valid solution because the sequence is not cyclically sorted.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "0 1 2", but this sequence is not cyclically sorted because the cyclic shifts [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], and [2, 0, 1] are not all sorted.

A correct solution for this case would be to print a sequence of numbers that is cyclically sorted, such as [1, 1, 1] or [2, 1, 1].
