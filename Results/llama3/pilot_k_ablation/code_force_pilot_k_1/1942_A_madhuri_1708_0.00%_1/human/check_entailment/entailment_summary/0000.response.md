Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program works by iterating over each test case and checking the values of n and k.

If k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n is equal to k. If true, it prints k repeated k times, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted. If false, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid solution.

If k is less than 2, the program prints a list of integers from 0 to n-1. This is also a valid solution because only one cyclic shift of this array will be sorted, which is the original array itself.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides valid solutions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
