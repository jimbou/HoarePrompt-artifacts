Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints output based on the values of `n` and `k`.

For each test case, if `k` is 1, the program prints numbers from 0 to `n-1`. This is a correct solution because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the original array itself.

If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k` repeated `k` times. This is also a correct solution because the array `[k, k, ..., k]` has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, which are all the same.

However, if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, the program prints -1. This is also correct because it is impossible to find an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
