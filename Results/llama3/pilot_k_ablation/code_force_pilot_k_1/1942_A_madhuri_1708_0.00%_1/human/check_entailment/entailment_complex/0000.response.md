Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program correctly handles the cases where k is 1 and where k is greater than or equal to 2.

When k is 1, the program prints numbers from 0 to n-1, which is a valid solution because the array [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1] has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the original array itself.

When k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n is equal to k. If n is equal to k, the program prints k repeated k times, which is a valid solution because the array [k, k, ..., k] has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts, which are all the same.

If n is not equal to k, the program prints -1, which is correct because it is not possible to find an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts when k is greater than or equal to 2 and n is not equal to k.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
