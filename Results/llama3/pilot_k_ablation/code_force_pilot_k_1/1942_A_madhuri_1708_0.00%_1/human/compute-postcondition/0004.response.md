The code prints the value of `k` repeated `k` times, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, and the current value of `k` is equal to `n`. Since `k` is equal to `n`, the value of `k` is also an integer between 1 and 10^3.

Output: **k (where k is the current value of k which is equal to n) repeated k times**
