Output State: **`n` and `k` are the last pair of integers from the input, `s` is the last line of the file object, stdin is empty. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, `k` repeated `k` times is printed for each test case where this condition is met, otherwise -1 is printed for each test case where this condition is met. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 0 to n-1 are printed for each test case where this condition is met.**
