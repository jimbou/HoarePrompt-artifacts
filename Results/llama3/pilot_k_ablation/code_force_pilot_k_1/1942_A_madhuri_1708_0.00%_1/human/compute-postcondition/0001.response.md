Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) must have at least 1 line**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the second line of the input, which contains two integers separated by a space. The value of `n` is the first integer and the value of `k` is the second integer. The stdin still contains the remaining input lines, but the number of lines is reduced by 1 since the second line has been read. The file object open(0) still has at least 1 line, which is the remaining input.
