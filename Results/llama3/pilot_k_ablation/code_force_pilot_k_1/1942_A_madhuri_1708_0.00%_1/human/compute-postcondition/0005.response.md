The code prints the value of `k` repeated `k` times, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, and the current value of `k` is equal to `n`. Since `k` is equal to `n`, the value of `k` is between 1 and 10^3.
Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) must have at least 1 line, and the current value of `k` is equal to `n`, and this is printed: k repeated k times, where k is equal to n and is an integer between 1 and 10^3**
