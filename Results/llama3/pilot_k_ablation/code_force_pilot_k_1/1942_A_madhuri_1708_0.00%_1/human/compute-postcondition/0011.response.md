The code prints a list of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is an integer. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the numbers in the list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a list of consecutive integers starting from 0 and ending at `n-1`.
Output: **[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1] (where n is the value of n)**
