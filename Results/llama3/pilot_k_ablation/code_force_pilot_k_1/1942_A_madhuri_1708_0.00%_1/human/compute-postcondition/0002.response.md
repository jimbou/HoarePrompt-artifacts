Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) must have at least 1 line, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.**
