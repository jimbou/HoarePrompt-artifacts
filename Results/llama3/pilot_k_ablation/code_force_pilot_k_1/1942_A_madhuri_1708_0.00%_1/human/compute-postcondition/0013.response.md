Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of the file object, stdin contains at least one line. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, `k` repeated `k` times is printed, otherwise -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 0 to n-1 are printed.***
