Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of the file object, stdin contains at least one line. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `k` repeated `k` times is printed, where `k` is equal to `n`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then -1 is printed.***
