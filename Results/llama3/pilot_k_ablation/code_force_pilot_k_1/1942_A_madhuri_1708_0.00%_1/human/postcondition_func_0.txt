This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). For each test case, if k is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if n is equal to k. If true, it prints k repeated k times. If false, it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 0 to n-1. After processing all test cases, stdin is left empty.
