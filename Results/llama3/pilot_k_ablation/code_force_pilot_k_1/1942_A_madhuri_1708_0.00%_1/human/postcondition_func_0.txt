This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints output based on the values of `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `k` is 1, it prints numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if `n` is equal to `k`, printing `k` repeated `k` times if true, and -1 otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `n` and `k` as the last pair of integers from the input, `s` as the last line of the file object, and stdin empty.
