Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32), and the remaining t inputs are strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    t = int(input())
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for i in range(t):
        a = str(input())
        
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `l` is 0, `h` is 0, stdin contains 0 input strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
