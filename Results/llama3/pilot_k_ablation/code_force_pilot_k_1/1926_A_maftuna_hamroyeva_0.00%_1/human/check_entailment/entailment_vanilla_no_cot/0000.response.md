Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not reset the counters `l` and `h` for each test case. As a result, the counts from previous test cases are carried over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results. 

To fix this, the counters `l` and `h` should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case, inside the outer loop. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        l = 0
        h = 0
        a = str(input())
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `count()` method of Python strings to simplify the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = str(input())
        if a.count('A') > a.count('B'):
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```
