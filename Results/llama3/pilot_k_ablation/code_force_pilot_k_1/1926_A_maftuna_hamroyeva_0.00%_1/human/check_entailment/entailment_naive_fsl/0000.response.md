Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has an equal number of 'A's and 'B's. In this case, the program does not print anything because it only checks if l > h or l < h, but it does not handle the case where l == h. 

For example, if the input is "AABBB", the program will not print anything, whereas it should print either 'A' or 'B' according to the problem description.
