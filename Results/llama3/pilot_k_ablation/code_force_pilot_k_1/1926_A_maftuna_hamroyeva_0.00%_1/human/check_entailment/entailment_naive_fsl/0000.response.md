Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not reset the counters `l` and `h` for each test case. The counters are initialized to 0 before the loop over the test cases, but they are not reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case. This means that the counts from previous test cases are carried over to the next test case, which is not correct.

For example, if the input is:

```
2
ABABB
ABABA
```

The program will print `B` for the first test case, which is correct. However, for the second test case, the program will print `B` again, which is incorrect. The correct output for the second test case should be `A`.

To fix this bug, the counters `l` and `h` should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case. The corrected code would be:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        l = 0
        h = 0
        a = str(input())
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')
```
