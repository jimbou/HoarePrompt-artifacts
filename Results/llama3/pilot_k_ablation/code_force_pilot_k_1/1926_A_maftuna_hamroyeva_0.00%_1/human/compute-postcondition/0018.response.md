Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a`, `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a`, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `l` is greater than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than `h`, 'B' is printed. If `l` is equal to `h`, no action is taken.***
