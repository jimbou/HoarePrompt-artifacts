Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `l` is 0, `h` is 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `a` and is not 'A', stdin contains `t-1` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

The code increments the value of `h` by 1, so `h` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `l` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `a` and is not 'A', and stdin contains `t-1` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, is still valid after the code has been executed.
