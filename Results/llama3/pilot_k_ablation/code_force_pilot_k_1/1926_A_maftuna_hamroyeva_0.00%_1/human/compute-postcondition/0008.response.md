Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, and stdin contains `t-2` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0, `h` is 1, `i` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.***
