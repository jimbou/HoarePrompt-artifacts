Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

In this output state, the value of `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, which is the first string input from stdin. The values of `t`, `l`, `h`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-1` strings, each of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, since one string has been consumed by the `input()` function.
