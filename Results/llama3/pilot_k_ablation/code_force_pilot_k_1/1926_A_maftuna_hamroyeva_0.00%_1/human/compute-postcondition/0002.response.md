Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains at least 0 input string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 32, `l` and `h` are still 0, and `i` is still 0. A new variable `a` is assigned a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, which is the first input string from stdin. The stdin now contains at least 0 input string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, meaning that the first input string has been consumed.
