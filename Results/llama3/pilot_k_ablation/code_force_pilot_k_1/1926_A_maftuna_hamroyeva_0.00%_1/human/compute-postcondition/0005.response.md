Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `l` is 1, `h` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 'A', stdin contains at least 0 input string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 0 input string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
