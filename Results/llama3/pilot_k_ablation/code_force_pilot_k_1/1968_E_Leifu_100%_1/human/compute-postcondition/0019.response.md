Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains one input less than the initial state, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` equals 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and 'j j' is printed for all j from 4 to n.***
