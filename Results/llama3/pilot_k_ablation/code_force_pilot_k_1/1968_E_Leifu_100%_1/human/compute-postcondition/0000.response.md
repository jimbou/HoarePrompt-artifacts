Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: a series of integers (greater than 1) equal to `t`.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is greater than 0. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a series of integers (greater than 1) equal to the value of `t`. The number of integers in the series is equal to the value of `t`.
