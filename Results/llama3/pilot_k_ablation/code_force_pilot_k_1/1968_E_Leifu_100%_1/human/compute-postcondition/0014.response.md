To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 4 in the initial state, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust `j` to be 4, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer not equal to 3 and is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains one input less than the initial state, '1 2' is printed, '2 4' is printed, `j` is 4**
