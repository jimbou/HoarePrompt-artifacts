The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, not equal to 3, and the current value of `n` is 4 or more, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 5 and j is now 4. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 5, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a single integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^3), and this is printed: '1 1', and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 4**
