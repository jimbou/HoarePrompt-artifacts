Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, stdin is empty, '1 1' and '1 2' are printed `t` times. If `n` equals 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and 'j j' is printed for all j from 4 to n, for each iteration of the loop.**
