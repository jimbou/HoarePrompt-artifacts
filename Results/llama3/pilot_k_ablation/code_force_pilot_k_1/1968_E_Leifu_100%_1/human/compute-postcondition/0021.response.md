Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the number of operations to perform. For each test case, it prints a series of pairs of integers, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', and then either '2 3' if the number of operations is 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs of identical integers from 4 to the number of operations if the number of operations is 4 or more. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces output in the form of these pairs of integers.**
