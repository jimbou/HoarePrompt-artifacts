Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a single integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, which is 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing a single integer `n`, because one line has been read and processed.
