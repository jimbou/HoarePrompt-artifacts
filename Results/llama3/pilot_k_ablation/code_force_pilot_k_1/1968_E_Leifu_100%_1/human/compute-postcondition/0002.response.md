Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains one input less than the initial state**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains at least 1, and the value of `i` remains 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer from the input. Since the input is consumed, the stdin now contains one input less than the initial state.
