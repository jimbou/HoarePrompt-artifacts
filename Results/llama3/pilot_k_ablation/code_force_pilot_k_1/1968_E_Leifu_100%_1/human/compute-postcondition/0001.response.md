According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we can also adjust the state of `i` to reflect its initial value.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^3)**
