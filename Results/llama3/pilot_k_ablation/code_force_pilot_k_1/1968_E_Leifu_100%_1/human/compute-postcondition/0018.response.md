Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive and not equal to 3, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing a single integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^3), and this is printed: '1 1', and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 4 or more, '2 4' is printed, and all numbers from 4 to `n` are printed along with themselves.***
