The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers, and each subsequent integer n is between 2 and 10^3. For each n, the function prints a series of pairs of numbers, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', and then either '2 3' if n is 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs of numbers from 4 to n if n is 4 or more. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces a specific output pattern based on the input values.
