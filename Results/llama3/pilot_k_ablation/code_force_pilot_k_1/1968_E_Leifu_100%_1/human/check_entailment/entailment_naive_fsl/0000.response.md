Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 6, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
5 5
6 6

However, the correct output for n = 6 should be:

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1

The program does not correctly handle the case when n is greater than 5. It simply prints the same pattern for all n >= 4, which is not correct.
