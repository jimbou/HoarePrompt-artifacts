Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a set of n points in an n x n grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by printing a set of points for each test case. Let's analyze the program's output for each test case:

1. For n = 2, the program prints:
   1 1
   1 2

   This is a correct solution, as the Manhattan distances between the two points are 0 and 1, which are distinct.

2. For n = 3, the program prints:
   1 1
   1 2
   2 3

   This is a correct solution, as the Manhattan distances between the three points are 0, 1, 2, and 3, which are distinct.

3. For n = 4, the program prints:
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4

   However, this is not a correct solution. The Manhattan distances between the four points are 0, 1, 2, and 3, but the program is missing the point (4, 4) which would provide the Manhattan distance 4.

4. For n >= 5, the program prints:
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4
   for j in range(4, n + 1):
       print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))

   This is not a correct solution for n >= 5. The program is missing some points that would provide additional distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
