Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases (t) as input, and for each test case, it takes the size of the grid (n) as input.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all test cases. This is because these two points will always have a Manhattan distance of 1, which is the minimum possible distance.

For n = 3, the program prints the coordinates (2, 3) in addition to the previous two points. This is because the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (2, 3) is 3, and the Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (2, 3) is 2. This results in a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is the maximum possible size for n = 3.

For n >= 4, the program prints the coordinates (2, 4) in addition to the previous two points. This is because the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is 3, and the Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4) is 2. The program then prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n. This is because the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (j, j) is j - 1, and the Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (j, j) is j - 2. This results in a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1}, which is the maximum possible size for n >= 4.

Therefore, the program correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
