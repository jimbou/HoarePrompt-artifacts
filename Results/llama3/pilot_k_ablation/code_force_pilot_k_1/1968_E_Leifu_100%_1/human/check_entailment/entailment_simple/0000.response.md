Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by printing a set of points that maximize the size of the Manhattan distance set for each input n.

For n = 2, the program prints '1 1' and '1 2', which is a valid solution as shown in the first example in the problem description.

For n = 3, the program prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3', which is also a valid solution as shown in the second example in the problem description.

For n >= 4, the program prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and then prints all numbers from 4 to n along with themselves. This is also a valid solution, as it creates a set of points that maximizes the size of the Manhattan distance set.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
