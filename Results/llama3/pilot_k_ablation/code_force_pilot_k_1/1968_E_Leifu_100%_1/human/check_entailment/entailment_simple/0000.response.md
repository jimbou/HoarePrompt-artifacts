Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case. These coordinates are chosen because they have a Manhattan distance of 1, which is the smallest possible Manhattan distance.

For n = 3, the program prints the coordinate (2, 3), which has a Manhattan distance of 2 with (1, 1) and a Manhattan distance of 1 with (1, 2). This choice maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For n >= 4, the program prints the coordinate (2, 4), which has a Manhattan distance of 3 with (1, 1) and a Manhattan distance of 2 with (1, 2). Then, for each j from 4 to n, the program prints the coordinate (j, j), which has a Manhattan distance of j - 1 with (1, 1) and a Manhattan distance of j - 2 with (1, 2). This choice maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
