Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases and the size of the grid as input and prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's logic is based on the examples provided in the problem description. For n = 2, it prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2). For n = 3, it prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3). For n >= 4, it prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and then pairs of identical integers from 4 to n.

The program's output matches the examples provided in the problem description, and it correctly handles the different cases for n. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
