Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by printing a series of pairs of numbers that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program's logic is based on the examples provided in the problem description.

For n = 2, the program correctly prints '1 1' and '1 2', which is one of the possible arrangements that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For n = 3, the program correctly prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3', which is one of the possible arrangements that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For n >= 4, the program prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and then pairs of numbers from 4 to n. This pattern does not match the examples provided in the problem description for n = 4, 5, and 6. Specifically, the program does not print the correct pairs of numbers for n = 4, 5, and 6.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for n >= 4.

Correctness: **False**
