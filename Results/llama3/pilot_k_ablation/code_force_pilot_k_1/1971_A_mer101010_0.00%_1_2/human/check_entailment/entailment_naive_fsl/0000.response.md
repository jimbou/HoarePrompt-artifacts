Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the numbers and prints them accordingly.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If a > b, it prints a, b
* If a == b, it prints a, b
* If a < b, it prints b, a

The program also handles the edge cases where a and b are equal, and where a and b are both 0.

The program's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
