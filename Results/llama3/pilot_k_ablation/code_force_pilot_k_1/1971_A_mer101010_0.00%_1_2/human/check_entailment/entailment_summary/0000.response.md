Reasoning:

The given program is designed to read a specified number of pairs of integers from standard input, compare each pair, and print the pair with the larger number first. If the numbers are equal, it prints them in the order they were read.

Upon reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the required logic. The program uses a for loop to iterate over the specified number of test cases, reads each pair of integers using the map function, and then uses an if-elif-else statement to determine the order in which to print the numbers.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the cases where the numbers are equal, greater than, or less than each other. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the pairs with the larger number first.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
