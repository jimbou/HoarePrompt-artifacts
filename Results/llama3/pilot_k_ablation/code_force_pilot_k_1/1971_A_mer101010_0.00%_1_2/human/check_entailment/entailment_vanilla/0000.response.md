Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
3. Inside the function, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
4. It then initializes a variable `t` to 0, which is not used anywhere in the function.
5. The function then enters a loop that runs `n` times.
6. In each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
7. It then checks the values of `a` and `b` using if-elif-else statements.
8. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
9. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
10. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.
11. The function does not return any value.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers and prints them in the required format. The use of if-elif-else statements ensures that the correct order of minimum and maximum is printed. The program also handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal correctly.
