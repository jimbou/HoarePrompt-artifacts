Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed where [a] is the current value of `a` and [b] is the current value of `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then "b a" is printed where `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed where `a` is equal to `b` and both are between 0 and 9.***
