Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). Additionally, if `a` is equal to `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed where `a` is equal to `b` and both are between 0 and 9. If `a` is less than or equal to `b` but not equal to `b`, then "b a" is printed where `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `a` is less than or equal to `b` and `a` is not equal to `b`.**
