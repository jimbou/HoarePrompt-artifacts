To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer equal to `t` (1 <= `n` <= 100), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).

Since `t` is 0, `n` is also 0, which means the loop will not execute. To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 0, which is the typical starting value for a range-based loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9), `i` is 0**
