The code prints the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9, where `a` is less than or equal to `b` and `a` is not equal to `b`. The values of `b` and `a` are printed with a space in between.
Output: **b (an integer between 0 and 9), a (an integer between 0 and 9, where a is less than or equal to b and a is not equal to b)**
