The code prints the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9. Specifically, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `b` is an integer between 0 and 9. The current value of `a` is greater than the current value of `b`.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 and is greater than b), b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9)**
