Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `t` (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from `stdin`, `i` is `n-1`. For each pair of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9) that were in `stdin`, if `x` is greater than `y`, then "[x] [y]" is printed where [x] is the current value of `x` and [y] is the current value of `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then "[y] [x]" is printed where [y] is the current value of `y` and [x] is the current value of `x`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then "[x] [y]" is printed where `x` is equal to `y` and both are between 0 and 9. If `n` is 0, then `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9) and nothing is printed.**
