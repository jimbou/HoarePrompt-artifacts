The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), `n` becomes `t`. The second line initializes `t` to 0. 

Output State: **n is an integer equal to t (1 <= n <= 100), t is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**
