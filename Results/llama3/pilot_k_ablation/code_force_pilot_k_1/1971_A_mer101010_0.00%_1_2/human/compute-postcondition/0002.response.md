The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the input, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, the first line is read and `a` and `b` are assigned the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `n`, `t`, and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**
