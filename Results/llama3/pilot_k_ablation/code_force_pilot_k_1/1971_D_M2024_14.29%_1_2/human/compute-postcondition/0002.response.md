The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the next string from stdin to `a`. Since stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `a` becomes one of these strings. The second line assigns the value 0 to `cut`. 

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, cut is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500**
