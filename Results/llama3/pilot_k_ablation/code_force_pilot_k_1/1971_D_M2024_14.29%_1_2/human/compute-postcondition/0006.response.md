Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length of at least 2, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cut` and `_` remain unchanged.***
