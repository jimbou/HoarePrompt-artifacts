The code prints the value of `cut` plus 1, where `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since `cut` is not explicitly defined, we can't compute its exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `cut` plus 1.
Output: ** `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, and cut + 1 is printed, where cut + 1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` plus 1**
