The code prints the value of `cut` plus 1. Where `cut` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cut`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cut` value plus 1.
Output: **cut + 1 (where cut is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string a)**
