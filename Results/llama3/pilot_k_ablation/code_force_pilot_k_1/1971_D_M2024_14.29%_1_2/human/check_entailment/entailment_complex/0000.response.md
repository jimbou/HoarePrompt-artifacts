Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating over each character in the string, and whenever it encounters a '1' followed by a '0', it increments the `cut` counter. This is because each such occurrence requires a cut to separate the '1' and '0' into different pieces. Finally, it prints the `cut` counter plus one, because even if there are no '1's followed by '0's, the string still needs to be cut into at least one piece (the entire string itself).

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input string is already sorted (in which case `cut` will be 0, and the program will print 1), and when the input string has only one character (in which case `cut` will be 0, and the program will print 1).

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
