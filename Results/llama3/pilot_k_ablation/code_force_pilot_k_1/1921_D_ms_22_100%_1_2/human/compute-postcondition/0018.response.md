Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers. If dif4 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b.***
