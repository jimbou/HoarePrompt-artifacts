Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b.**

The code increments `ans` by `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`. It then increments `a1` by 1 and decrements `b2` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
