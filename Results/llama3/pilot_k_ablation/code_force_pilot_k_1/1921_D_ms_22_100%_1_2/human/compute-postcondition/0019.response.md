Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and the current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif1. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif1. In both cases, dif1 is greater than or equal to dif2 and dif3 is greater than or equal to dif4. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b.***
