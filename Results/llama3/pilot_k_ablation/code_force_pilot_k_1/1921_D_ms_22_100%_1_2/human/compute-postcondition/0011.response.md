Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The current value of dif1 is greater than dif2. The current value of dif3 is less than or equal to dif1.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`. It also increments `a1` and `b1` by 1, effectively moving the pointers in both lists one step forward. As a result, `dif1` now represents the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`, and `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
