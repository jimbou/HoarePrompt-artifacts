Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and the second last element of b. The absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than dif4. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b.**
