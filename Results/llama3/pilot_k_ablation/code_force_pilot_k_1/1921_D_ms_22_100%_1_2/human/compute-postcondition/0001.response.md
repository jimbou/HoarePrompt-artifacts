The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the program is being run as the main module and stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains an integer representing the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, the second line contains n integers a_i, and the third line contains m integers b_i.**
