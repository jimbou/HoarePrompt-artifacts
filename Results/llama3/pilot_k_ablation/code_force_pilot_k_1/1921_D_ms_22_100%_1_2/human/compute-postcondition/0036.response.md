The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of lists `a` and `b` that are the farthest apart.

Since `a` and `b` are sorted lists, the farthest apart elements are the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`. 

The absolute difference between the last elements is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])` which is `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` since `a2` is -1 and `b2` is -1.

The absolute difference between the first elements is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])` which is `abs(a[n] - b[m])` since `a1` is n and `b1` is m.

However, since `a` and `b` are lists of length `n` and `m` respectively, `a[n]` and `b[m]` are out of range.

Therefore, the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` that are the farthest apart is `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])`.

Output: **abs(a[-1] - b[-1]) (which is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and b that are the farthest apart)**
