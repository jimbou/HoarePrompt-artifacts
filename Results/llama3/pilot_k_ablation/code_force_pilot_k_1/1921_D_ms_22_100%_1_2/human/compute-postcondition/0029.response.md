Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second last element of b. The absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`. It then decrements `a2` and `b2` by 1, effectively moving the pointers to the second last elements of `a` and `b`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` remain unchanged, but `dif4` is updated to be the absolute difference between the second last elements of `a` and `b`. The relationships between the absolute differences remain valid, with the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b` being less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b` being less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`.
