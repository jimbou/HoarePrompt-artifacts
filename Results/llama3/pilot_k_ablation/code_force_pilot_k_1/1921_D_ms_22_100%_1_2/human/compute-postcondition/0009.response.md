Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif1 is greater than or equal to dif2. The current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif1.**

The code executes three lines. The first line adds the value of dif3 to ans. The second line decrements a2 by 1. The third line increments b1 by 1. 

The value of ans is increased by dif3. The value of a2 is decreased by 1. The value of b1 is increased by 1. 

The values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated based on the changes to a2 and b1. The new value of dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b. The new value of dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b. The new value of dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second element of b. The new value of dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the last element of b. 

The relationships between dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated based on their new values. The current value of dif1 is greater than or equal to dif2. The current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than or equal to dif1. 

The values of t, stdin, n, m, a, b, and a1 remain unchanged.
