To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer, but being an integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, the second line contains n integers a_i, and the third line contains m integers b_i**
