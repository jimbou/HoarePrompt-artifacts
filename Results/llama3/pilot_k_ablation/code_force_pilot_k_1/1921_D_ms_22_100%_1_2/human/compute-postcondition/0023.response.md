Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than dif2.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`. It then decrements `a2` by 1, making it `n - 2`, and increments `b1` by 1, making it 1. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The relationship between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` is maintained, with `dif3` being greater than both `dif4` and `dif2`.
