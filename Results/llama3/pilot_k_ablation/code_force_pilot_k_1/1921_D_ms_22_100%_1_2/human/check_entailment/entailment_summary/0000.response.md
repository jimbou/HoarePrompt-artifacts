Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by choosing n integers from the list b_i and arranging them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i of length n, such that the total difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| is as large as possible.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, followed by the n integers and m integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of the two lists that are farthest apart. The program prints this sum for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it considers all possible pairs of elements from the two lists and chooses the pair with the maximum absolute difference. This is done by comparing the absolute differences between the elements at the beginning and end of the sorted lists, and choosing the pair with the maximum difference.

Correctness: **True**
