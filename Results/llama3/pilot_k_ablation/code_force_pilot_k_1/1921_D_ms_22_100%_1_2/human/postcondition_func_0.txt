This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers and m integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of the two lists that are farthest apart. The function prints this sum for each test case.
