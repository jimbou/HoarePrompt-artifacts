Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the program calculates the number of operations required to make all elements in the list greater than or equal to the median, which is not the same thing.

The program sorts the array and finds the median. Then, it counts the number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where increasing the median by 1 would require increasing all elements less than the median by 1, which would be more than the minimum number of operations required.

For example, in the test case [5, 5, 5, 4, 5], the program would output 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 1, because increasing the median by 1 would require increasing only one element (the 4) by 1.

Correctness: **False**
