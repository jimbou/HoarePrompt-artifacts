Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median of an array. The given program sorts the array and calculates the median. It then iterates through the array, adding the difference between the median and each element that is less than the median to the total number of operations.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows increasing any element in the array by 1 in one operation, and the goal is to increase the median. The given program calculates the total difference between the median and all elements less than the median, which is not the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]. The median is 2. The program would calculate the total difference between the median and all elements less than the median, which is 1 (2 - 1). However, the minimum number of operations required to increase the median is actually 2, because we need to increase the two elements that are equal to the median (2) to increase the median.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
