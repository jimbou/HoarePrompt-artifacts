Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current program calculates the sum of the differences between the median and all numbers less than the median, which is not the correct approach.

The correct approach is to find the number of elements that are equal to the median and need to be increased. This is because increasing any of these elements by 1 will increase the median. The program should count the number of elements that are equal to the median and print this count as the minimum number of operations required.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        median = a[median_index]
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a[i] == median:
                operations += 1
            else:
                break
        print(operations)
```

This corrected code first finds the median of the array, then counts the number of elements that are equal to the median, starting from the median index. It stops counting as soon as it encounters an element that is greater than the median. The count of elements equal to the median is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
