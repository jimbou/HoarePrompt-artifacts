Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The issue lies in the fact that the program calculates the number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median, which is not the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

A counterexample is the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 1, because we can increase the median by increasing one of the elements to 2.

The correct approach is to find the number of elements that need to be increased to make the median greater than its current value. This can be done by counting the number of elements that are equal to the median and adding 1 to the count if the length of the array is even.
