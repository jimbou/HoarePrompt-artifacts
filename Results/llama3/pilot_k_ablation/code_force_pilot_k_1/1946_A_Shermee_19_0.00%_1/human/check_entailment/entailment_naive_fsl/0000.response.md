Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the length of the array is even. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but the program only considers the first middle number.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1, because we need to increase the first middle number (2) by 1 to make the median (2.5) greater than the original median (2).

The program should be modified to handle the case when the length of the array is even. One possible solution is to calculate the median as the average of the two middle numbers when the length is even, and then calculate the number of operations needed to increase the median.
