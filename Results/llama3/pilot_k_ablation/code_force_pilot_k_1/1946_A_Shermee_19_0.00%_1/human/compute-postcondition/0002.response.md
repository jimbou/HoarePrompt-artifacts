Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, median is the middle value of the sorted list a, operations is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, _ is 0**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case, assigns the first line to `n`, and the second line to `a` as a list of integers. It then sorts `a` in ascending order. The median index is calculated as `n // 2`, and the median is assigned the value at this index in the sorted list `a`. The variable `operations` is initialized to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` is not affected by the code and remains 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
