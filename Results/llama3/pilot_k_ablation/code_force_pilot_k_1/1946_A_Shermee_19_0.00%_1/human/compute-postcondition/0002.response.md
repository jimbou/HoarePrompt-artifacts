Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, median is the middle value of the sorted list a, operations is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is assigned from the input, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers obtained from the input. The `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2`, and the `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a`. The `operations` variable is initialized to 0. The stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
