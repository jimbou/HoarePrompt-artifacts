The code prints the sum of the differences between the `median` and each element in `a` that is less than the `median`. Where `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a` and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9.
Output: ** `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, and the sum of the differences between the `median` and each element in `a` that is less than the `median` is printed**
