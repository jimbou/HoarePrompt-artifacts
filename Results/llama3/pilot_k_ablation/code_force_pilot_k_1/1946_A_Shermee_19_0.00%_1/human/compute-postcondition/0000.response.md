Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a space-separated list of integers. The length of the list is equal to the first integer. All integers are between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since we have already read one integer. Each test case still contains two inputs: the length of the array and the space-separated list of integers, with the length of the list equal to the first integer and all integers between 1 and 10^9.
