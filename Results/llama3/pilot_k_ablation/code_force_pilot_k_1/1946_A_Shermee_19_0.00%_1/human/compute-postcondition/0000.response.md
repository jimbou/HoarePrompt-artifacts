Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), but one test case has been read.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read, so the number of test cases remaining is `t-1`. Each test case still contains two lines, but the first line of the first test case has been read, so the first line of the next test case is now the first line in stdin.
