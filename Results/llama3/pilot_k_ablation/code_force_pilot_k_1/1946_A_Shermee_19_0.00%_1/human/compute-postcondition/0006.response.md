Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than the `median`, then `operations` is equal to `median - a[i]`.***
