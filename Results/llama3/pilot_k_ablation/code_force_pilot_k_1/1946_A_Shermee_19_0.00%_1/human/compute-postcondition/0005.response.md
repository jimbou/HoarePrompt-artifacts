Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a`, `operations` is equal to `median - a[0]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is less than the `median`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `operations` has been updated to be equal to the difference between the median of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
