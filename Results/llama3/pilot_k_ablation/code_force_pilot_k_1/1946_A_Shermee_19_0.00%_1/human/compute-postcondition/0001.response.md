To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0**
