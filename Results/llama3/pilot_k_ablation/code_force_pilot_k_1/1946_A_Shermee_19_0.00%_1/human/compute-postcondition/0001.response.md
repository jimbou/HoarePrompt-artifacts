The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer and stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), but one test case has been read. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), but one test case has been read, `_` is 0**
