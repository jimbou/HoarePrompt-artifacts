To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0. Additionally, we need to initialize `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a`, `operations` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
