According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the loop execute, `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `median` is the middle value of the sorted list `a`, `operations` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
