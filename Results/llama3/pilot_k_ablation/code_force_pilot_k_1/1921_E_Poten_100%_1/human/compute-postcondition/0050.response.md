Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then the fourth element of `clues` is equal to the sixth element of `clues` and `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is not 1, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
