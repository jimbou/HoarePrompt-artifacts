Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The value of `answers` depends on the parity of the third and fifth elements of `clues` and their values. If the third and fifth elements of `clues` have the same parity, then if they are equal, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If they are not equal, then if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third and fifth elements of `clues` have different parity, then if they are equal, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If they are not equal, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2 is less than the difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
