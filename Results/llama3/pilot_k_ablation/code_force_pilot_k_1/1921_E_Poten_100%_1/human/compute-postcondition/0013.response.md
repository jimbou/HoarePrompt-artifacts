Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third and fifth elements of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2***
