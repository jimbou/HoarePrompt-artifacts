Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`.**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the `answers` list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The conditions on the `clues` list and the stdin are still valid.
