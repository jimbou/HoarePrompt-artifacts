Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the counter `i` remains at 0, and the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The list of clues and the input in stdin remain unchanged. All the conditions related to the elements of the clues list are still valid.
