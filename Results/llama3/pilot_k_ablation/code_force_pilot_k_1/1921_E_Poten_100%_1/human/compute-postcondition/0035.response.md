Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even, or the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2 is less than the difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases remains between 1 and 10^4. The list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The value of `i` is still 0. The list of clues remains unchanged. The standard input contains one less test case. All the conditions related to the elements of the clues list are still valid.
