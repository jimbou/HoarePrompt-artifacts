Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even, or the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd. The current value of the third element of `clues` is equal to the current value of the fifth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Alice', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
