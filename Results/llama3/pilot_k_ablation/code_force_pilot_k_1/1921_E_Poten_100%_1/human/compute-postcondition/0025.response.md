Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob' or 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.**
