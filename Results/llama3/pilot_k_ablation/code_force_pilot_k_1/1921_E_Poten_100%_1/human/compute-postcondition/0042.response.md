Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the counter `i` remains at 0, and the list `answers` now contains the string 'Draw'. The list `clues` remains unchanged, and the input stream still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. All the conditions related to the elements of `clues` are still valid.
