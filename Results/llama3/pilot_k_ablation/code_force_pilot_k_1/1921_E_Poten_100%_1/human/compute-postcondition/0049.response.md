Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Alice' or 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even, or the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd. If the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2 is less than the difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
