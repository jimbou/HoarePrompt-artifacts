Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third and fifth elements of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the value of `i` remains 0, and the list `answers` now contains the string 'Bob'. The list `clues` and its properties remain unchanged. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two integers.
