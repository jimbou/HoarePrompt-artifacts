Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, and the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), and the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still between 1 and 10,000. The list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'. The variable `i` remains 0. The list of clues is still a list of integers. The standard input contains one less test case. The conditions on the elements of the clues list are still satisfied, including the third element being less than the fifth element, the first element not being 1, and the third and fifth elements having the same parity. The difference between the fifth element and 1 is still less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements divided by 2.
