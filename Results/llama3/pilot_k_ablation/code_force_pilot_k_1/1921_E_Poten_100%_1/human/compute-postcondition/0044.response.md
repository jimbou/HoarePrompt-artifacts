Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even, or the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that the number of test cases is still between 1 and 10^4, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the variable `i` remains 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The conditions on the elements of the list of clues also remain the same. The only change is that the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice'.
