Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The current value of the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases remains the same, but the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'. The value of `i` is still 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before. The properties of the clues list, such as the relationship between the third and fifth elements, and their parity, are still valid.
