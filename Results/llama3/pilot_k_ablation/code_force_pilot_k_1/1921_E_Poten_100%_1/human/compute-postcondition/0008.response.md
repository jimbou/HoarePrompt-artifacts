Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third and fifth elements of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The current value of the fourth element of `clues` is equal to the current value of the sixth element of `clues`.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'Bob', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the elements of `clues` are still valid, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two integers.
