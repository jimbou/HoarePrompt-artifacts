To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be at least 1. Since `test_cases` is already given as an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can confirm that it meets this condition. The variable `i` is the loop counter and should start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases**
