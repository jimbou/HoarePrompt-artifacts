To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `test_cases` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer**
