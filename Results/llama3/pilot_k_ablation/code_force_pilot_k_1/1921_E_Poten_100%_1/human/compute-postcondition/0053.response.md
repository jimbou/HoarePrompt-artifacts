To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the list `answers`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case, `clues` is the last list of integers read from stdin, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed, the list `answers` must have at least 1 element and `j` is the first element in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is the last list of integers read from stdin, stdin is empty**
