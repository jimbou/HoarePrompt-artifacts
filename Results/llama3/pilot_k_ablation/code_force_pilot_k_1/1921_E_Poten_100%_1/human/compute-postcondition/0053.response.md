The only objects in the loop head are variable  j and list  answers, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the answers.  If the list has at least 1 answer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases is a non-negative integer and answers is a list of strings where each string is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and the length of answers is equal to test_cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 answer and the j is the first answer in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a non-negative integer, `answers` is a list of strings where each string is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and the length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases` and must have at least 1 answer, j is the first answer in the list**
