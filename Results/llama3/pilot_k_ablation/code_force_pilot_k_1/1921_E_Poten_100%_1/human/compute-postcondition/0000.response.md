Output State: **test_cases is an integer, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input from stdin to `test_cases`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, after this line, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The second line initializes an empty list `answers`. No other variables are affected.
