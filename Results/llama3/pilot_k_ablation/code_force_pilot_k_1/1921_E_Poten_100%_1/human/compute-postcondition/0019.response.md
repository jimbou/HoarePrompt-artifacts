Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still between 1 and 10^4. The list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The value of `i` remains 0. The list of clues is still the same. The standard input contains one less test case. The conditions on the elements of the clues list are still satisfied.
