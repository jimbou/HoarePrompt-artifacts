Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. If the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.**
