Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the counter `i` remains at 0, and the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice'. The list of clues remains unchanged, and the standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. All the conditions related to the elements of the `clues` list are still valid.
