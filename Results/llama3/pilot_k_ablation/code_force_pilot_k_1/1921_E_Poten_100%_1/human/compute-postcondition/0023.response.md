Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.***
