You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes 1 time. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n is at least 1.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list with at least one student, student is the first student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**
Your Task:

Initial State: test_cases is an integer, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')

```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing one element which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the value of `answers` is determined by the following rules: If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Bob' if the fourth element of `clues` is equal to the sixth element of `clues`. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is 1, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is not 1, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the first iteration of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
