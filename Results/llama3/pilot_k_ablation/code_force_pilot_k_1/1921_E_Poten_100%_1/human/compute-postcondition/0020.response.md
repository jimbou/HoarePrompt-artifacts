Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2***
