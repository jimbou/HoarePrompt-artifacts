Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, and the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), and the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`.**
