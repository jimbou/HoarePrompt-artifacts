Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is between 1 and 10,000. The list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'. The variable i is still 0. The list of clues remains the same. The standard input contains one less test case. All the conditions related to the elements of the clues list are still valid.
