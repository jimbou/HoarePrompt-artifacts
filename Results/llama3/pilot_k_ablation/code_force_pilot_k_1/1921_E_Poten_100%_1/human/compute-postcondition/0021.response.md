Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Bob', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
