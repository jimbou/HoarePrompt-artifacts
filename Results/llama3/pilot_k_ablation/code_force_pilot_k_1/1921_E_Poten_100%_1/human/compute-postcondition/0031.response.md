Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even, or the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still between 1 and 10,000. The list of answers now contains the string 'Alice'. The variable `i` remains 0. The list of clues is still a list of integers. The standard input contains one less test case. The properties of the clues list remain the same: the third element is less than or equal to the fifth element, the first element is not 1, the third and fifth elements have different parity (one is odd and the other is even), and they differ by 1.
