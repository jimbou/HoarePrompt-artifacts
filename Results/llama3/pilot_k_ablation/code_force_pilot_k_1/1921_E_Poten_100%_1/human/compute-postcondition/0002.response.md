Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read and processed. The values of the other variables, `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
