The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` accepts a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `clues`. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer, so after accepting one test case, it will contain multiple test cases minus two integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.**
