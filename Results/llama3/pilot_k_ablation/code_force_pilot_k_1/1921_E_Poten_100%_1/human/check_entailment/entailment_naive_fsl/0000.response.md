Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the initial positions of Alice and Bob are (2, 2) and (4, 4) respectively, and the board size is 6x6, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" instead of "Alice". This is because the program does not correctly calculate the number of moves it takes for Alice to reach Bob's position.

In this case, Alice can move down-right to (3, 3), then down-right again to (4, 4), which is Bob's position. However, the program does not consider this possibility and incorrectly concludes that Alice cannot reach Bob's position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
