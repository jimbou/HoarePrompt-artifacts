Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board.

The program first checks if Alice's chip is in the last row or if the board has only one row. If either condition is true, the game is a draw.

Then, it checks if Alice's chip and Bob's chip are in the same column. If they are, the game is a draw.

Next, it checks if Alice's chip and Bob's chip are in the same parity (i.e., both even or both odd). If they are, the game is a draw.

If none of the above conditions are true, the program checks if Alice's chip is to the left of Bob's chip. If it is, the game is a draw if the distance between the chips is greater than the absolute difference between their rows divided by 2. Otherwise, Bob wins.

If Alice's chip is to the right of Bob's chip, the program checks if the distance between the chips is greater than the absolute difference between their rows divided by 2. If it is, the game is a draw. Otherwise, Alice wins.

Finally, the program prints the result of each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
