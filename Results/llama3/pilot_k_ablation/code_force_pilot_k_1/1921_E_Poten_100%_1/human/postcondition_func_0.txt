This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's and Bob's. It then determines the winner of each test case based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board, and prints the result as either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.
