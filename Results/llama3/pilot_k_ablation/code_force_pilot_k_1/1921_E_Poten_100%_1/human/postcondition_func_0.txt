This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's and Bob's. It then determines the outcome of a game based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board, and appends the result ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') to a list. The function repeats this process for each test case and finally prints all the results.
