stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board, and x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w.
