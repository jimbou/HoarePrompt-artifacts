Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the total amount of water in all containers and the target amount of water each container should have. It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

2. The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total, `container`.

3. If at any point the running total, `container`, becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, given the constraint that water can only be poured from a container to a container with a higher index.

4. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Therefore, it returns 'YES', which is correct.

Correctness: **True**
