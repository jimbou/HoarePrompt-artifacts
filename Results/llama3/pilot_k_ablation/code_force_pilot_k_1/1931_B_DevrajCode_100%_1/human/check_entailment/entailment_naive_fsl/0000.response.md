Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount for each container. It then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the target level. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target level, so the program returns 'NO'. If the program finishes iterating through all containers without finding a negative cumulative difference, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, in which case it immediately returns 'NO'. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of containers is 1, in which case it returns 'YES' because there is only one container and it already has the correct amount of water.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
