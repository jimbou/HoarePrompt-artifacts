Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` takes the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a` as input, calculates the target amount of water per container, and then checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.

The program correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, returning 'NO' in this case. It also correctly checks if the amount of water in each container can be made equal to the target amount by pouring water from one container to another, returning 'NO' if this is not possible.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required operations. It also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the number of containers is 1 or when the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
