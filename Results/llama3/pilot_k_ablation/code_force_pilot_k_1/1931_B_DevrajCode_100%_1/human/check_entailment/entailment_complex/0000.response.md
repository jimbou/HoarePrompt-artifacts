Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly in this case.

2. If the total water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total `container`.

4. If at any point the running total `container` becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

5. If the program completes the loop without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers, so it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list `a` is empty, because in this case the loop doesn't execute and `container` remains 0, which is not less than 0.

Correctness: **True**
