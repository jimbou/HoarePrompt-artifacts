Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water for each container. It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'NO'.

The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container, subtracting the target amount from each and adding the result to a running total. If the running total ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to distribute to the current container, so it returns 'NO'.

If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
