Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have. It then iterates over the list of water levels, keeping track of the difference between the current container's water level and the target amount. If at any point this difference is negative, it means that the current container does not have enough water to reach the target amount, and the function returns 'NO'. If the function completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it means that all containers can be filled to the target amount, and the function returns 'YES'.

This logic is correct because it takes into account the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. By keeping track of the difference between the current container's water level and the target amount, the function effectively simulates the process of pouring water from one container to another, and it correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
