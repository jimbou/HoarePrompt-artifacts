Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, total_water is the sum of the elements in a, and target is the sum of the elements in a divided by n.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` also remains unchanged, containing `n` non-negative integers. The variable `total_water` is assigned the sum of all elements in list `a`, which is a specific value since `a` contains a fixed set of integers. The variable `target` is assigned the result of dividing `total_water` by `n`, which is also a specific value since both `total_water` and `n` are known.
