The code calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water per container. The first line calculates the total amount of water by summing up all the elements in list `a`. The second line calculates the target amount of water per container by performing integer division of the total amount of water by the number of containers `n`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, the length of a is equal to n, total_water is the sum of a, and target is the integer division of total_water by n.**
