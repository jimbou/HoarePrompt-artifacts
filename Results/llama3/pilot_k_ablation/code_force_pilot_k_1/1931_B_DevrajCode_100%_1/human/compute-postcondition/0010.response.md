Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, and `container` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target`. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', then `container` is not less than 0. If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute and `container` remains 0.**
