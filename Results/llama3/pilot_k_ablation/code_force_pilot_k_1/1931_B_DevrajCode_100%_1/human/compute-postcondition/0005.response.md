To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `water` and the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `container` is 0, and `water` is the first element in `a`**
