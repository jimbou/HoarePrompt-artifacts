The only variable in the loop head is variable water and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list a has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, the length of a is equal to n, total_water is the sum of a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, total_water is divisible by n, and container is 0. So for the loop to be executed the list a must have at least 1 element and water is the first element in the list a.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `container` is 0, water is the first element in the list a**
