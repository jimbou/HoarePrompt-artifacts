Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, and `container` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged, as the code only introduces a new variable `container` and assigns it a value of 0. The divisibility of `total_water` by `n` is still valid, and the other variables maintain their original properties.
