Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`. The current value of `water` is the first element in `a`. The current value of `container` is `water - target` and is less than 0.**
