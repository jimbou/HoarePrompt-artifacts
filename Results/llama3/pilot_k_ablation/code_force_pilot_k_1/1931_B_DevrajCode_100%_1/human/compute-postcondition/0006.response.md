Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `container` is `a[0] - (total_water/n)`, water is the first element in the list a**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated to be the difference between the first element of the list `a` (which is `water`) and the `target` value, which is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
