Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `container` is `water - target`, and `water` is the first element in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated to `water - target`, where `water` is the first element in the list `a` and `target` is the average of the elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
