Functionality: **Determines if it's possible to distribute water evenly among containers.**

This function takes a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of water in each container and the total number of containers as input. It calculates the target amount of water each container should have if the water is distributed evenly. If the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through the list of water amounts, calculating the difference between each amount and the target amount. If at any point the cumulative difference is negative, the function returns 'NO'. If the function completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.
