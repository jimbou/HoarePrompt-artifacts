The input contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) — the size of the array a, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) — the elements of the array a.
