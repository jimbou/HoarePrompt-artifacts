The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` in `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 1, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second integer from `lit`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
