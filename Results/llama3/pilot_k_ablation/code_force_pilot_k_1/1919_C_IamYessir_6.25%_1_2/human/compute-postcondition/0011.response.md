Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all the integers from `lit` that are less than or equal to the last integer in `a` and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing all the integers from `lit` that are greater than the last integer in `a`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`***
