Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all the integers from `lit` that are less than or equal to the last integer in `a`, `b` is a list containing all the integers from `lit` that are greater than the last integer in `a`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, and `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first element plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first element. If `a` has less than 2 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first element. If `b` has less than 2 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first element, and the value of `s` is being printed**
