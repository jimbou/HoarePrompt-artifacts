Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second integer from `lit` if the first integer in `lit` is less than the second integer in `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1***
