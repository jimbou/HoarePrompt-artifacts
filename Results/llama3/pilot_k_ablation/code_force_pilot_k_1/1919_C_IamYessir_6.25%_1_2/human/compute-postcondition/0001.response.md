Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, which was obtained from the first input. The value of `lit` is a list of integers, which was obtained from the second input. The value of `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`. The value of `b` is an empty list. The value of `cp` is 0. The value of stdin is multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The value of `_` is 0.
