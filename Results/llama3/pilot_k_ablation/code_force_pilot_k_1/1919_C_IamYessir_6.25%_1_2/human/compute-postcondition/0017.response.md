Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all the integers from `lit` that are less than or equal to the last integer in `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 integers from `lit` that are greater than the last integer in `a`, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first element plus 1. If `a` has less than 2 elements, `s` is 1. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that there is one more pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first element. All other variables remain unchanged.
