To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**
