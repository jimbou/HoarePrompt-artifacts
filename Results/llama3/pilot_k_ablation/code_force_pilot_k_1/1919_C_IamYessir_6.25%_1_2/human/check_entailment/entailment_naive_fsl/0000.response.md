Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
3 1 4 1 5

The program will output 2, but the correct output is 1. The program incorrectly splits the array into two subsequences [3, 1, 5] and [4, 1], which results in a penalty of 2. However, the optimal split is [3, 4, 1] and [1, 5], which results in a penalty of 1.

The program's mistake is that it always appends the current element to the first subsequence if it is smaller than the last element of the first subsequence. However, this approach does not always lead to the optimal split. A correct approach would be to consider all possible splits and choose the one that results in the minimum penalty.
