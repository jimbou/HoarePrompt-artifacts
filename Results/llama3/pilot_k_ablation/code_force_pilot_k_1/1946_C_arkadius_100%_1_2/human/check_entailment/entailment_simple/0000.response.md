Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where we need to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the range of possible values for x from 1 to n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. Then, it iteratively checks the middle value of the range to see if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a recursive function (func_1) to count the number of connected components in the tree with size at least x and the total size of the remaining connected components with size less than x. It then uses another function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program correctly implements the binary search approach and the recursive function to count the number of connected components and the total size of the remaining connected components. It also correctly checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
