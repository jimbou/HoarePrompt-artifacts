Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

The issue lies in the `func_1` and `func_2` functions. These functions are designed to count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges. However, they do not correctly handle the case when a subtree has a size greater than or equal to `x` but is not a good component.

In the `func_1` function, the line `good_components[v] += good_components[u]` is incorrect. This line assumes that the good components of the subtree rooted at `u` are also good components of the subtree rooted at `v`. However, this is not necessarily true. A subtree rooted at `u` may have a size greater than or equal to `x` but not be a good component of the subtree rooted at `v`.

Similarly, in the `func_2` function, the line `good_components += good_components_subtree` is incorrect. This line assumes that the good components of the subtree rooted at `u` are also good components of the subtree rooted at `v`. However, this is not necessarily true.

As a result, the program may incorrectly count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider a tree with the following structure:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6

If `x` is 3, the program will incorrectly count the subtree rooted at 2 as a good component, even though it has a size of 3 but is not a good component of the subtree rooted at 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
