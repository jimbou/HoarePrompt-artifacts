Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a given tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by defining the search range [beg, end] as [1, n], where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

2.  The program then enters a while loop, which continues until beg is no longer less than end. In each iteration, it calculates the mid value of the current search range and checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least mid.

3.  To perform this check, the program uses a recursive function (func_2) to traverse the tree and count the number of connected components with a size of at least x. It also keeps track of the remaining size of the tree after removing these components.

4.  If the number of connected components with a size of at least mid is greater than k, or if it is equal to k and the remaining size of the tree is at least mid, the program updates the search range to [mid, end]. Otherwise, it updates the search range to [beg, mid - 1].

5.  Once the while loop terminates, the program returns the value of beg, which represents the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the maximum value of x, and it correctly checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least x.

Correctness: **True**
