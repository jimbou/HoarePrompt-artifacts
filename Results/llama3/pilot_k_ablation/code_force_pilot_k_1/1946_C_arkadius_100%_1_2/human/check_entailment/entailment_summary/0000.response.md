Correctness: **True** 

Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a given tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific purpose:

1.  `func_1`: This function calculates and returns the number of subtrees of a given size threshold and the total size of subtrees smaller than the threshold for a specified node in a tree.
2.  `func_2`: This function calculates and returns the number of good components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree data structure, where a good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size x.
3.  `func_3`: This function determines if a tree can be split into connected components of a minimum size by removing a specified number of edges.
4.  `func_4`: This function performs a binary search on a tree data structure with n vertices to find the smallest value of mid for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True.
5.  `func_5`: This function constructs a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges from user input, and then prints the result of `func_4`, which takes the constructed tree, the number of nodes n, and a positive integer k as input.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x. It starts by initializing the lower and upper bounds of the search range (beg and end) to 1 and n, respectively. Then, it iteratively calculates the midpoint (mid) of the range and checks if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True. If it is, the program updates the lower bound (beg) to mid; otherwise, it updates the upper bound (end) to mid - 1. This process continues until the lower and upper bounds converge, at which point the program returns the value of beg as the maximum number x.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
