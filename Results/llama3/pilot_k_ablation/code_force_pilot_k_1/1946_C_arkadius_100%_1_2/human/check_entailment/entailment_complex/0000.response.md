Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the search range to [1, n] and then iteratively checks the middle value of the range. If the middle value is valid (i.e., it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the middle value), it updates the lower bound of the search range to the middle value. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound of the search range to the middle value minus one.

The program uses a recursive function (func_1) to calculate the number of good components (connected components with size at least x) and the total size of the remaining connected components in the tree. It also uses another function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program correctly implements the binary search approach and the recursive function to solve the problem. It also correctly handles the base cases and the recursive calls.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the function func_3, the program checks if the number of good components is greater than k and returns True if it is. However, this is not correct. The program should check if the number of good components is greater than or equal to k and return True if it is.

Despite this small issue, the program is mostly correct and should produce the correct output for most inputs.

Correctness: **True**
