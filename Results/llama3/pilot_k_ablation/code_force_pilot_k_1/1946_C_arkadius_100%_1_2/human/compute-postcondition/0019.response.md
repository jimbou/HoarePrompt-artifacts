Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with a 'vertices' attribute that maps vertices to objects with a 'children' attribute, `s` is a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is a list containing tuples (u, False) for each child u of s and (s, True), `good_components` is a dictionary with one key-value pair (s, 0), `remaining_size` is a dictionary with one key-value pair (s, 1), and the length of stack is equal to the number of children of s plus one. If `postorder` is `True`, then `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of each key is the sum of the values of its children plus 1 if the remaining size of any child is greater than or equal to `x`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the value of each key is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children if none of the children's remaining sizes are greater than or equal to `x`. If `tree.vertices[v].children` is empty, then `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` remain unchanged.***
