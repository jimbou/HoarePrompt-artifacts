Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a 'vertices' attribute that maps vertices to objects with a 'children' attribute, `s` is a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where `good_components[v]` is increased by 1, `remaining_size` is a dictionary, `v` is equal to `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`. The current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The tree structure, the value of `s`, `x`, `stack`, `remaining_size`, `v`, `postorder`, and `u` are the same as in the initial state.
