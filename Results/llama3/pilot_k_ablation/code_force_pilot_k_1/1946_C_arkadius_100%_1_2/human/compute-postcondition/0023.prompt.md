You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object with a 'vertices' attribute that maps vertices to objects with a 'children' attribute, s is a vertex in the tree, and x is a non-negative integer.
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of each key is the number of its children and its children's children and so on that have a subtree of size greater than or equal to `x`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the value of each key is the sum of the sizes of its children and its children's children and so on that have a subtree of size less than `x`, `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the number of children and their children and so on of node 's' that have a subtree of size greater than or equal to 'x', and the second value is the sum of the sizes of the children and their children and so on of node 's' that have a subtree of size less than 'x'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the number of children and their children and so on of node 's' that have a subtree of size greater than or equal to 'x', and the second value is the sum of the sizes of the children and their children and so on of node 's' that have a subtree of size less than 'x'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
