Output State: **The program returns the smallest value of `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, or `n` if no such `mid` exists.**

In this output state, `mid` is a value that makes the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` return True. The value of `mid` is the smallest among all possible values that satisfy this condition. If no such value exists, the program returns `n`, which is the number of vertices in the tree data structure.
