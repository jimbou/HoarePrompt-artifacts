Functionality: This function calculates and returns the number of subtrees of a given size threshold and the total size of subtrees smaller than the threshold for a specified node in a tree. It takes a tree, a node in the tree, and a non-negative integer as input, and returns a tuple containing the count of subtrees with size greater than or equal to the threshold and the total size of subtrees with size less than the threshold. The function does not modify the input tree or node.
