Functionality: This function calculates and returns two values related to the subtree sizes of a given node 's' in a tree. It counts the number of descendants of 's' that have a subtree size greater than or equal to a specified threshold 'x', and it sums the sizes of the descendants of 's' that have a subtree size less than 'x'. The function leaves the input tree, node 's', and threshold 'x' unchanged.
