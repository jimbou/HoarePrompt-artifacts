Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**.

In this output state, the values of n and k are updated to the input values, and a new Tree object with n nodes is created. The Tree object is not further specified, as the code does not provide any additional information about its structure or properties.
