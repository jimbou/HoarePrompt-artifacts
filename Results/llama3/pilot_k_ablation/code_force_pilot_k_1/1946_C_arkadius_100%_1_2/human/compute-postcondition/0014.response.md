Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with a 'vertices' attribute that maps vertices to objects with a 'children' attribute, `s` is a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary, `v` is equal to `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`, and `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`***
