Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a 'vertices' attribute that maps vertices to objects with a 'children' attribute, `s` is a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`, `v` is equal to `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`, and `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its attributes remain unchanged. The vertex `s` is still a vertex in the tree. The value of `x` is still a non-negative integer. The stack is still empty. The `good_components` dictionary remains unchanged. The `remaining_size` dictionary has been updated such that the value of `remaining_size[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`. The vertex `v` is still equal to `s`. The value of `postorder` is still `True`. The children of `tree.vertices[v]` still have at least one child. The vertex `u` is still the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`. The value of `remaining_size[u]` is still less than `x`.
