Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `beg` is the smallest value of `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, `end` is `beg - 1`. If no such `mid` exists, then `beg` is equal to `n` and `end` is equal to `n-1`.**
