Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `tree` is a Tree object with n nodes and n-1 edges, `i` is n-1, stdin contains no more input, and the root of the tree has been visited and processed non-recursively.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The `tree` object is still a Tree object with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, but its root node has been visited and processed non-recursively through the `root_tree_non_recursive` method. The value of `i` is still `n-1`, and there is no input left in stdin.
