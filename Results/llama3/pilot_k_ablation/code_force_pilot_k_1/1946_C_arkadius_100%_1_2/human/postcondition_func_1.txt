This function calculates and returns the number of good components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree data structure, where a good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size x. Additionally, it returns the sum of the remaining sizes of the subtrees rooted at the children of v that are less than the minimum size x. The function takes as input a tree data structure, a vertex v in the tree, and a positive integer x representing the minimum size of each connected component.
