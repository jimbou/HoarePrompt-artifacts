stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines of two space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The second integer is the length of the array and the number of queries. The list of integers represents the array c. The pairs of integers represent the borders of the subarray. All integers are positive.
