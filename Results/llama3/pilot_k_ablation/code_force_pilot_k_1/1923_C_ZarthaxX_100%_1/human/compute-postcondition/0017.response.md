Output: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer that must be at least 1, nums is a list of integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, l and r are integers, onesInRange is an integer equal to the count of 1's in the range of nums from index l-1 to r, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of the elements in the range of nums from index l-1 to r. 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is larger than sumInRange, and 'NO' is printed**
