Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to the console. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer n and q from stdin, followed by a list of n integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum and count of 1's in the list. The function reads q queries from stdin, each consisting of two integers l and r. For each query, it checks if a certain condition is met based on the cumulative sum and count of 1's in the range [l, r]. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all queries have been processed, leaving the stdin empty.**
