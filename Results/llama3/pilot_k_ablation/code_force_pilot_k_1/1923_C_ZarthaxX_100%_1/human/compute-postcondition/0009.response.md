Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1's in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`. The current value of `l` equals the current value of `r`, and 'NO' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` are not affected by this statement. The current value of `l` is still equal to the current value of `r`, and 'NO' is still printed. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
