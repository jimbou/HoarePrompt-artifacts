Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, `l` and `r` are integers and they are equal, `stdin` contains one input: a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop and 'NO' is being printed**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed, but the loop moves to the next iteration. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers, and 'NO' is still being printed.
