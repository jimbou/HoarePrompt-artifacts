Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1's in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged. The code only affects the values of `l` and `r`, which are assigned the two integers from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, since two integers have been consumed from the input.
