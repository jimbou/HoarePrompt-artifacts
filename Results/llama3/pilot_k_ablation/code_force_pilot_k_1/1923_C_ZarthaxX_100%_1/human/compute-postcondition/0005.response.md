Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains one input: a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, and `_` remain unchanged. However, `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, which are separated by a space. The stdin now contains one input: a space-separated list of integers, because the input() function consumes the input and splits it into two integers.
