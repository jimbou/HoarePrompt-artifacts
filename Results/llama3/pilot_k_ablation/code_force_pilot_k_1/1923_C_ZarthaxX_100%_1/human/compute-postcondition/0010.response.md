Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, `l` and `r` are integers. If `l` equals `r`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
