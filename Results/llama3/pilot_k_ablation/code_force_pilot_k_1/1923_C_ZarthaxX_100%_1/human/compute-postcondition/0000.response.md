Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros**

The first line reads a test case from stdin, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `q`. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, assigning it to `nums`. The third and fourth lines initialize two lists, `ones` and `sum`, each with `n+1` zeros. No other variables are affected.
