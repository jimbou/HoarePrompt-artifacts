Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin is empty.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n` and `q`. Since stdin contains one input, which is an integer greater than 0, `n` becomes this integer value, and `q` becomes an integer. Stdin is now empty.

The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `nums`. However, since stdin is empty after the first line, this line does not affect the state of `nums`.

The third and fourth lines initialize `ones` and `sum` as lists of `n+1` zeros. The value of `n` is used to determine the length of these lists.

Overall, the code assigns values to `n` and `q`, initializes `ones` and `sum` as lists of zeros, and leaves `nums` unaffected. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
