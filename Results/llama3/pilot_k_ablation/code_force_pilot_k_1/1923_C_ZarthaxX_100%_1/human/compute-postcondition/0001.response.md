The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0, so it ensures that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. i is now 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
