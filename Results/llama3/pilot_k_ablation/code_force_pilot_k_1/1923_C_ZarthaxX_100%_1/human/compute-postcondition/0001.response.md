To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know that `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` zeros, and `sum` is a list of `n+1` zeros. However, these states do not guarantee the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 1.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `sum` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `i` is 1**
