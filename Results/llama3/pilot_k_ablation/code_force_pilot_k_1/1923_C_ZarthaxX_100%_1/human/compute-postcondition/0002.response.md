Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, stdin is empty, i is 1**

The code snippet updates the `ones` and `sum` lists based on the value of `nums[i-1]`. The first line increments the count of 1's in the `ones` list at index `i` if the `i-1`th element of `nums` is 1. The second line adds the `i-1`th element of `nums` to the sum at index `i` in the `sum` list. The values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 1.
