Output State: **n is greater than 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code updates the `ones` and `sum` lists based on the value of `nums[i-1]`. The `ones` list is updated to count the number of 1's in the first `i` elements of `nums`, and the `sum` list is updated to store the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The other variables, `n`, `q`, and `nums`, are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
