To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0**
