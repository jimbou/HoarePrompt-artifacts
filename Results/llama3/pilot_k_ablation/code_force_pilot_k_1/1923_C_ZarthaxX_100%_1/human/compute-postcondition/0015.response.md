Postcondition: ***n is an integer, q is greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the count of 1's in the first r elements and the count of 1's in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums. Additionally, 2 times onesInRange plus the difference between r and l plus 1 minus onesInRange is strictly greater than sumInRange***
