Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the prefix sum of the array `nums` and the prefix count of ones in the array. This allows it to efficiently calculate the sum and count of ones in any subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, it calculates the sum and count of ones in the subarray from index `l` to `r`.

3. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the count of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the count of ones. This is because each one in the subarray needs to be replaced with a two, and the remaining elements need to be positive.

4. If the condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `l` equals `r`, in which case it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be "good". 

Overall, the program accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good" and handles all edge cases correctly.
