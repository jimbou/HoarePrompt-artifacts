Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether a given subarray is good or not based on the problem description. The program uses two auxiliary arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of elements in the prefix of the array, respectively. This allows it to efficiently calculate the number of ones and the sum of elements in any subarray in constant time.

The program then iterates over each query and checks if the subarray is good by comparing the number of ones and the sum of elements in the subarray. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is a correct implementation of the problem description's conditions.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles edge cases such as when the subarray has only one element (in which case it prints "NO") and when the subarray has no ones (in which case it prints "YES" if the sum of elements is greater than or equal to the length of the subarray).

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
