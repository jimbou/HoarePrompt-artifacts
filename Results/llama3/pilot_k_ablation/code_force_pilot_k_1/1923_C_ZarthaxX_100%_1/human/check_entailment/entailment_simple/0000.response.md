Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` arrays to keep track of the count of 1's and the sum of the elements in the `nums` array, respectively.

2. The program then iterates over the `q` queries. For each query, it calculates the number of 1's and the sum of the elements in the specified range `[l, r]`.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the elements in the range is sufficient to make all elements in the range greater than 1. This is done by checking if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. This condition is derived from the fact that each 1 in the range needs to be increased by 2 to make it greater than 1, and each non-1 in the range needs to be increased by 1.

4. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` by immediately printing 'NO', since a single-element subarray cannot be good.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
