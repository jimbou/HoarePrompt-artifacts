Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the integers in the list. This is done to efficiently calculate the count of 1's and the sum of integers in any range [l, r] in O(1) time.

2. For each query, the program checks if the sum of the integers in the range [l, r] is greater than or equal to twice the count of 1's in the range plus the length of the range minus the count of 1's. This condition is derived from the problem description.

   - If the sum of the integers in the range [l, r] is greater than or equal to twice the count of 1's in the range plus the length of the range minus the count of 1's, it means that we can construct an integer array b of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of b is equal to the sum of the subarray, b_i > 0 for every index i, and a_i != b_i for every index i. This is because we can assign a value of 1 to each b_i where a_i is not 1, and assign a value of a_i + 1 to each b_i where a_i is 1. This way, the sum of b is equal to the sum of the subarray, and b_i > 0 for every index i. Also, a_i != b_i for every index i because we assigned a value of a_i + 1 to each b_i where a_i is 1, and assigned a value of 1 to each b_i where a_i is not 1.

   - If the sum of the integers in the range [l, r] is less than twice the count of 1's in the range plus the length of the range minus the count of 1's, it means that we cannot construct an integer array b of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of b is equal to the sum of the subarray, b_i > 0 for every index i, and a_i != b_i for every index i.

3. Based on the condition, the program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
