Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum and count of 1's in the input array `nums`.
2. For each query, it correctly calculates the sum and count of 1's in the range `[l, r]`.
3. It correctly checks the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` to determine if the subarray is good.
4. It correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result of the condition check.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `l == r`, in which case it prints 'NO' immediately.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
