Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2. It initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` of length `n+1` to keep track of the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the integers in the array, respectively.

3. For each query, it reads the left and right indices `l` and `r` of the subarray. If `l` is equal to `r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good.

4. It calculates the count of 1's in the range `[l, r]` by subtracting the count of 1's at index `l-1` from the count of 1's at index `r`. It also calculates the sum of the integers in the range `[l, r]` by subtracting the sum at index `l-1` from the sum at index `r`.

5. It checks if the sum of the integers in the range is greater than or equal to twice the count of 1's in the range plus the length of the range minus the count of 1's. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The logic implemented in the program is correct and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
