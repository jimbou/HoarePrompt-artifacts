Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the input string `s` and converts it into a list of characters.
3. The program then defines a function `func_1()` that takes no arguments.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program iterates over the possible lengths of the tandem repeat `j` from `n // 2` down to 1.
5. For each `j`, the program iterates over the starting positions `k` of the tandem repeat in the string.
6. For each `k`, the program checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either equal or both question marks. If they are, it increments a counter `count`.
7. If the counter `count` reaches `j`, it means that a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the program prints this length and returns.
8. If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths and starting positions, the program returns 0.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
