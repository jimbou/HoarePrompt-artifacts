Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for sequences of consecutive pairs of characters that are either equal or contain a '?'. If such a sequence is found, it prints the length of the sequence multiplied by 2 and terminates. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible sequences, it returns 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain any tandem repeats, in which case it returns 0. It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains tandem repeats, in which case it prints the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
