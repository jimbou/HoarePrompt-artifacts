Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program works by iterating over the string from the middle to the start, checking for sequences of consecutive pairs of characters that are either equal or contain a '?'. If such a sequence is found, the program prints the length of the sequence multiplied by 2 and terminates. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible sequences, the program returns 0.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the `func_1()` function is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
