Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string is a single character. In this case, the function `func_1` is not called because `n // 2` is 0, and the program does not print anything. However, according to the problem description, the output should be 0 in this case, because it is impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in a string of length 1.

To fix this issue, the program should add a special case to handle strings of length 1, and print 0 in this case.
