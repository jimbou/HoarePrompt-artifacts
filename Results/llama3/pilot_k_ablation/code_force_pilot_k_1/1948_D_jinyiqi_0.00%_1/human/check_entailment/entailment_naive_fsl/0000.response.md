Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over all possible lengths of tandem repeats from `n // 2` to `1`, where `n` is the length of the input string. For each length `j`, it checks all substrings of length `j` to see if they can be made equal to their corresponding substrings `j` positions ahead by replacing question marks. If it finds a match, it prints the length of the tandem repeat (`2 * j`) and returns.

The program correctly handles the case where it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, in which case it prints `0`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
