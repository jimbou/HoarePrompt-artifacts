#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:

    #State: `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `count` is either 0 or `n - 1` if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `count` is 0. If the loop executed, `k` is `n - 2`. If the loop did not execute, `k` is undefined.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t from stdin, followed by t strings, and then for each string, it searches for the longest substring with the same characters or question marks. If such a substring is found, the function prints its length multiplied by 2 and returns. If no such substring is found, the function returns 0.
