Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2 and `n - j` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 1, `k` is 0, and the current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `n - j` is greater than 0. The value of `j` is still `n // 2`, and `k` remains 0. The relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` also remains the same, with `s[k]` being either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` being '?'.
