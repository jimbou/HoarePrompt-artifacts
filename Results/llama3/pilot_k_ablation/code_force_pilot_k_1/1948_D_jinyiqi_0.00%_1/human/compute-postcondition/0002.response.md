To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`, and `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - j` is greater than 0.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2 and `n - j` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, `k` is 0**
