The only variables in the loop head are variables `k`, `n`, and `j`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - j`. If `n - j` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is at least 2 and `j` is `n // 2`, we know that `n - j` is at least 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `count` is 0**
