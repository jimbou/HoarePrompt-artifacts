Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.***
