The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `j` is `n // 2`.
