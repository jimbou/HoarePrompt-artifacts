To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the expression `n // 2`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n // 2` is greater than 0. Since `n` is an integer, this means `n` must be at least 2.

Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings. However, this information does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The loop's execution depends only on the value of `n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is at least 2, and we can set `j` to its initial value, which is `n // 2`.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
