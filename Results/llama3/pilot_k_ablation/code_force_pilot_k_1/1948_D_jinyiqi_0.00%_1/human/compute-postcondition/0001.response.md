Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `stdin`, `n`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `count` which is initialized to 0.
