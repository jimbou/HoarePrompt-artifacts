Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `count` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `j` remain the same as in the initial state, and the stdin still contains two inputs: an integer `t` and `t` strings. The only change is that a new variable `count` is introduced and initialized to 0.
