Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`**

The code sets the value of `count` to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The conditions `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` are still valid.
