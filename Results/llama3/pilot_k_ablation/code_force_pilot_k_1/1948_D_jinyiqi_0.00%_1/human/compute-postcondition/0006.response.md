Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2 and `n - j` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, and neither `s[k]` nor `s[k + j]` is '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The relationship between `n` and `j` remains the same, with `j` being half of `n`. The values of `k`, `s[k]`, and `s[k + j]` also remain unchanged, with `k` still being 0 and neither `s[k]` nor `s[k + j]` being '?', and `s[k]` not equal to `s[k + j]`.
