The code prints the value of `count` multiplied by 2. Since `count` is equal to `j`, which is `n // 2`, the printed value will be `n`.
Output: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The current value of `count` equals `j`. `s[k]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, and the value of count * 2 which is n is being printed**
