Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, `n` is at least 2 and `n - j` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n // 2`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then the current value of `count` is 1. Otherwise, the current value of `count` is 0. The current value of `count` equals `j`***
