Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `count` is 0. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'***
