Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` strings, each consisting of 1 to 5000 lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. If a sequence of `j` consecutive pairs of characters in `s` are either equal or contain a '?', then `count` is `j` and the loop has printed `count * 2` and terminated. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and the loop has completed all iterations without printing anything.**
