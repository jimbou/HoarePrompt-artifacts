This function takes a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks as input and checks for sequences of consecutive pairs of characters that are either equal or contain a '?'. If such a sequence is found, the function prints the length of the sequence multiplied by 2 and terminates. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible sequences, the function returns 0.
