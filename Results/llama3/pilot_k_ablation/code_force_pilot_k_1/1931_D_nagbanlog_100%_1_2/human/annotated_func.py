#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of two lists, the first list contains three integers n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and x and y are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9, the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` are not defined as they are local variables within the loop. If `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` will also be an empty list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, or an empty list if `test_cases` is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of frequencies of required modulus pairs for each test case in a given list of test cases and returns the results as a list of integers. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
