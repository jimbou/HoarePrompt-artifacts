Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, or an empty list if `test_cases` is empty.**

In this output state, the returned list `results` contains the sum of frequencies of required modulus pairs for each test case. The frequency of each modulus pair is determined by the `freq` list, and the numbers in `a` for each test case. If the `test_cases` list is empty, the `results` list will also be empty.
