To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `case` and the list `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the list has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, and `results` is an empty list, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to have at least 1 test case.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
