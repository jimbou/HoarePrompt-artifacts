Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` are not defined as they are local variables within the loop. If `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` will also be an empty list.**
