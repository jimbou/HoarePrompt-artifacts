Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 where the frequency of each modulus pair (mod_x, mod_y) is the number of times it appears in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) that exist in `freq` for each number in `a`. If `a` is empty, `freq` will remain empty and `beautiful_count` will be 0.**
