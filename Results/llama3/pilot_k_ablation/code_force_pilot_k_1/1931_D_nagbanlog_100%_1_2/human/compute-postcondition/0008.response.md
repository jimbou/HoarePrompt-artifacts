Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and the frequency of the modulus pair (mod_x, mod_y) is increased by 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the modulus of `num` with respect to `x`, `mod_y` is the modulus of `num` with respect to `y`, `required_mod_x` is the required modulus for `x` to match the modulus of `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If the required modulus pair (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) exists in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of this pair in `freq`.**

In this output state, the frequency of the modulus pair (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in the dictionary `freq` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
