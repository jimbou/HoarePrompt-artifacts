Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a list that must have at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0, num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the modulus of num with respect to x, mod_y is the modulus of num with respect to y, required_mod_x is the required modulus for x to match the modulus of y, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y. The current value of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.***
