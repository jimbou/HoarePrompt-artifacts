The code appends the value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. The value of `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) that exist in `freq` for each number in `a`. 

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `beautiful_count`. However, we can conclude that `beautiful_count` is a non-negative integer because it is the sum of frequencies.

The `results` list is initially empty, so after appending `beautiful_count`, it will contain one element, which is `beautiful_count`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing one element which is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 where the frequency of each modulus pair (mod_x, mod_y) is the number of times it appears in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a`.**
