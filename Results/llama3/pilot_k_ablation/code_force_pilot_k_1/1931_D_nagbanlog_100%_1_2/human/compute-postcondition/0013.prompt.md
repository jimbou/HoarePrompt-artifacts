You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of two lists, the first list contains three integers n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and x and y are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9, the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` are not defined as they are local variables within the loop. If `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` will also be an empty list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, or an empty list if `test_cases` is empty.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the frequencies of the required modulus pairs that exist in `freq` for each number in `a` for each test case, or an empty list if `test_cases` is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
