Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the current required modulus pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the modulus of `num` with respect to `x`, `mod_y` is the modulus of `num` with respect to `y`, `required_mod_x` is the required modulus for `x` to match the modulus of `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `beautiful_count` variable has been increased by the frequency of the current required modulus pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
