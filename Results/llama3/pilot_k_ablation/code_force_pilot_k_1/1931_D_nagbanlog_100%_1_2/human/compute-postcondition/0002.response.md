Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a list, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0**

The code snippet extracts values from a test case in the `test_cases` list and assigns them to variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. It also extracts an array from the test case and assigns it to variable `a`. Additionally, it initializes a dictionary `freq` with a default value of 0 and a variable `beautiful_count` to 0. The initial state of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remains unchanged.
