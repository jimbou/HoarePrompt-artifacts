Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each modulus pair (mod_x, mod_y) and then checks for the required modulus pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) for each number in the array. If the required modulus pair is found in the dictionary, it increments the beautiful_count. The program returns the beautiful_count for each test case.

The program also handles the case where the input list of test cases is empty, in which case it returns an empty list.

Correctness: **True**
