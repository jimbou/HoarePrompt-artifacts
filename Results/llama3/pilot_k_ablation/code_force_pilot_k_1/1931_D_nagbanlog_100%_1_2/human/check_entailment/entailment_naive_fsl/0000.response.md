Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values (mod_x, mod_y) for each number in the array. It then iterates through the array, calculating the required modulo values for each number to form a beautiful pair, and checks if the required pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the beautiful_count. The program handles all possible cases, including when the required pair is the same as the current pair (i.e., when mod_x == required_mod_x and mod_y == required_mod_y), and when the required pair is different from the current pair. The program also handles the case when x or y is 1, which is a special case that needs to be handled separately. Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
