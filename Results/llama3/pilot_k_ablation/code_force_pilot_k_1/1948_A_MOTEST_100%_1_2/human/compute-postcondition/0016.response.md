Output State: **`s` is a string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`. For each even integer `n` read from stdin, a string consisting of the first `n/2` characters of `s` repeated twice is printed, preceded by 'YES'. For each odd integer `n` read from stdin, 'NO' is printed. If `t` is 0, no integers are read from stdin and no output is printed.**
