Output State: **stdin contains t integers n, s is a string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive**.

The first line of the code, `os.system('cls')`, clears the console screen but does not affect any variables or the state of stdin. The second line, `s = string.ascii_uppercase`, assigns the string of all uppercase English letters to the variable `s`. The third line, `t = int(input())`, reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since stdin initially contains two inputs (an integer `t` and then `t` integers `n`), after reading the first integer `t`, stdin is left with `t` integers `n`. The value of `t` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, as specified in the initial state.
