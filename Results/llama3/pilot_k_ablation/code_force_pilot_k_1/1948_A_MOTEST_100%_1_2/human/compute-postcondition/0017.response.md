Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers to read. For each subsequent integer n, if n is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of the first n/2 uppercase English letters repeated twice. If n is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If t is 0, the function does not read any integers and does not produce any output.**
