The code prints the value of `operations`, which is the sum of the differences between the `median` and all elements in `a` that are less than the `median`. 

Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the `median` is the middle element of the list (or the average of the two middle elements if `n` is even), and `median_index` is `n` // 2. The `operations` is calculated by summing up the differences between the `median` and all elements in `a` that are less than the `median`. 

However, the exact value of `operations` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of the elements in the list `a`. 

Therefore, the print statement will output the calculated sum of differences between the median and all elements in `a` that are less than the median.

Output: **the sum of differences between the median and all elements in a that are less than the median**
