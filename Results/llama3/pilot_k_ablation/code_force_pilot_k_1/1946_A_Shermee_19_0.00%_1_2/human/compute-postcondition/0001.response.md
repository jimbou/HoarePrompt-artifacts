According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
