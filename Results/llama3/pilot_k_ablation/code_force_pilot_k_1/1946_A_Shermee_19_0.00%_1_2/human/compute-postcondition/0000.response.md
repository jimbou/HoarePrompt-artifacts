The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5). Therefore, `t` is assigned the value of `n` from the first test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
