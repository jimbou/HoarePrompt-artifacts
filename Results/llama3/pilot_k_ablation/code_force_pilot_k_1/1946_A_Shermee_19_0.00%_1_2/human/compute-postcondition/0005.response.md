Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `median_index` is `n` // 2, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is `median - a[0]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than the `median`.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated to `median - a[0]`, which is the difference between the median and the first element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, and the median is still at the index `n` // 2. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is still less than the median.
