Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `median_index` is `n` // 2, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than the `median`.**
