Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `median_index` is `n` // 2, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is the sum of the differences between the `median` and all elements in `a` that are less than the `median`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`.**
