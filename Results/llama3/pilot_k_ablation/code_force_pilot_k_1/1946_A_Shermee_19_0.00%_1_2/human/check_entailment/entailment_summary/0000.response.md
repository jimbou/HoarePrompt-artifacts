Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array, but the program calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the list of integers greater than or equal to the median. This is not the same task.

The program sorts the array and finds the median. Then, it calculates the number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median. However, this is not the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. 

To increase the median, we only need to increase the elements that are equal to the median and are at the median index or to its right. We don't need to increase all elements that are less than the median.

Correctness: **False**
