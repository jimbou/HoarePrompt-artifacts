Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It sorts the array, finds the median, and then calculates the number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median.

However, the program does not actually increase the median. It only calculates the number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median. This is not the correct interpretation of the problem.

The problem statement asks to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. This means that the program should find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, not to make all elements less than the median equal to the median.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
