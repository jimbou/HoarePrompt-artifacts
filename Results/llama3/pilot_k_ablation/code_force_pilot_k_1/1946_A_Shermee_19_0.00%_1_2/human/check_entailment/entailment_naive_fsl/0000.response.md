Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the length of the array is even. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but the program only considers the first middle number as the median. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1, because we need to increase the first middle number (2) by 1 to make the median (2.5) greater than the original median (2).

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
Expected output:
```
1
```
Actual output:
```
0
```
The program does not handle the case when the length of the array is even correctly, so it is incorrect.
