Output State: **k, x, and a are integers, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, _ is 0**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the values of three integers from stdin to k, x, and a, respectively. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, after this line, stdin will contain multiple test cases minus one. The second line initializes a variable s to 0. The third line does not affect any variables.

After executing the entire code block, k, x, and a will be integers, s will be 0, stdin will contain multiple test cases minus one, and _ will remain 0.
