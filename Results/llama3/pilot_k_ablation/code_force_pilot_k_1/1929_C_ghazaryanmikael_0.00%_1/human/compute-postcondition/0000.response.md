The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the return value of the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of the input() function. If the return value of the input() function is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the return value of the input() function must be at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, the return value of the input() function must be at least 1, _ is 0**
