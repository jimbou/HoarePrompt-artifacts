The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input().According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() must have at least 1 test case and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input() must have at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
