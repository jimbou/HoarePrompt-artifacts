The code prints 'YES' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `s` is the sum of `x` times (`s // (k - 1) + 1`), where `x` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, and `s` is equal to the sum of `x` times (`s // (k - 1) + 1`). The value of `a` is an integer.
Output: **YES if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise NO (where a is an integer and s is the sum of x times (s // (k - 1) + 1))**
