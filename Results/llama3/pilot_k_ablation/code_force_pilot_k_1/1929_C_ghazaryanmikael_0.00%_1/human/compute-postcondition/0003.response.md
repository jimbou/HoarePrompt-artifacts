Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1` times larger than its initial value, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `x` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be `s // (k - 1) + 1` times larger than its initial value, which was 0. This means that `s` is now equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of the other variables, including `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `_`, remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` is greater than 0 is still valid.
