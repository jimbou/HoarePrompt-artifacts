Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1` plus the initial value of `s` which is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its initial value, which was 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
