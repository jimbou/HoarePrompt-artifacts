This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and prints a 'YES' or 'NO' result for each test case.
