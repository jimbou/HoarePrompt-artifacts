This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty after execution.
