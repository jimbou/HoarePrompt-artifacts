Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The variable `s` is used to calculate the maximum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row, and then wins once. The amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win is the sum of the amounts he needs to bet in each of the `x` losing rounds, plus the amount he needs to bet in the winning round.

The program then checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated amount `s`. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
