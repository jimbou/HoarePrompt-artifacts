Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers k, x, and a.

2. The program correctly calculates the value s, which represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row, and calculating the total amount of coins he needs to have in order to recover from these losses.

3. The program correctly prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise. This is because if a is greater than or equal to s, then Sasha has enough coins to guarantee that he can win any number of coins, and if a is less than s, then Sasha does not have enough coins to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.

4. The program correctly processes multiple test cases, and prints a 'YES' or 'NO' result for each test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
