Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input.
2. It initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the total amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.
3. It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses Sasha can have.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates the amount of coins Sasha needs to bet in order to guarantee having as many coins as he wants in case of a win. This is done by adding the current value of `s` divided by `k-1` (rounded up) to `s`. This is because Sasha needs to bet at least `s // (k-1) + 1` coins to guarantee having `s` coins in case of a win.
5. After the loop, it checks whether the initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the total amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee having as many coins as he wants. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The loop correctly calculates the total amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee having as many coins as he wants, and the final check correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants based on the initial amount of coins.

Correctness: **True**
