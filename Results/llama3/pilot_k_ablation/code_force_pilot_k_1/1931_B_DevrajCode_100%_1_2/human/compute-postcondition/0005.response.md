According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `container` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 element and `water` is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, the length of `a` is `n`, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `container` is 0, water is the first element in the list**
