Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, the length of a is n, total_water is the sum of a, and target is the integer division of total_water by n.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` also retains its original properties, consisting of non-negative integers with a length equal to `n`. The sum of the elements in `a` is now explicitly represented by the variable `total_water`, which is the sum of all elements in `a`. The variable `target` is calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, resulting in the quotient of the total sum of `a` divided by `n`.
