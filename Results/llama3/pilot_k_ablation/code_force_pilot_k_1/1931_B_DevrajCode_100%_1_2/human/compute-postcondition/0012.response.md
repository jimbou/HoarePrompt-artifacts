Functionality: This function determines whether it is possible to distribute water equally among 'n' containers, given a list 'a' of non-negative integers representing the initial water levels in each container. It returns 'YES' if the water can be distributed evenly and 'NO' otherwise. The function takes into account the total amount of water and the target amount each container should hold, and it checks if the water can be redistributed without exceeding the capacity of any container.
