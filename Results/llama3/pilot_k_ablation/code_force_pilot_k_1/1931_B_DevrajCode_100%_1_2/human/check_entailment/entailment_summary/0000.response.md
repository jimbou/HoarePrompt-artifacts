Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to distribute water evenly among 'n' containers.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have. It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by 'n', and if not, it immediately returns 'NO' because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.

2.  The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total 'container'.

3.  If at any point the running total 'container' becomes negative, the program immediately returns 'NO'. This is because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to distribute to the current container, making it impossible to distribute the water evenly.

4.  If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
