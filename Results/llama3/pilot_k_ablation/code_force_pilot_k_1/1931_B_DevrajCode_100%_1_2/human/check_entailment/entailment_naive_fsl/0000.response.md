Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have. It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the program returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container, subtracting the target amount from each container's amount and adding the result to a running total (container). If the running total ever becomes negative, the program returns 'NO' because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's amount equal to the target amount.

If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES' because it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including cases where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, cases where there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's amount equal to the target amount, and cases where it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
