Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the total amount of water (`total_water`) and the target amount of water per container (`target`) by dividing the total water by the number of containers (`n`). It then checks if the total water is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

2. The program then iterates over the list of water amounts (`a`) and calculates the difference between each amount and the target amount (`water - target`). It adds this difference to a running total (`container`). If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the program returns 'NO'.

3. If the program completes the iteration over the list of water amounts without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers, so it returns 'YES'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
