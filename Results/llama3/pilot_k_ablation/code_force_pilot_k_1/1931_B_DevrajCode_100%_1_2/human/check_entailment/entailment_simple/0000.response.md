Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the total amount of water in all containers and the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total amount divided by the number of containers. It checks if the total amount is divisible by the number of containers, and if not, it returns 'NO'. This is correct because if the total amount is not divisible by the number of containers, it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the amount of water in the container and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total, `container`. If at any point `container` becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because if `container` becomes negative, it means that the amount of water that needs to be poured from previous containers to the current container is more than the amount of water available in the previous containers.

3. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES'. This is correct because if the program has not returned 'NO' by this point, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from previous containers to later containers.

Correctness: **True**
