Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t blocks of inputs. Each block contains an integer n and then a list of n integers. The sum of the integers in each block is divisible by n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that was read from the input. The stdin still contains t blocks of inputs, where each block consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. The sum of the integers in each block is divisible by n, as specified in the initial state.
