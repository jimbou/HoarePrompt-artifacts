Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0**

The code reads an integer `n` from the input, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads `n` integers from the input, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `arr`. The sum of the integers in `arr` is divisible by `n`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in the input decreases by 1, leaving `t-1` test cases.
