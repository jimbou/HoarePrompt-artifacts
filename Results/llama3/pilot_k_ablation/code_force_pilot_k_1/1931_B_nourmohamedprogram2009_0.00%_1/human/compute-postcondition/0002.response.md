Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 blocks of inputs. Each block contains an integer n and then a list of n integers. The sum of the integers in each block is divisible by n, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of n integers.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, and stdin contains `t` blocks of inputs, after reading one block, `t-1` blocks remain in stdin. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The third line sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 0.
