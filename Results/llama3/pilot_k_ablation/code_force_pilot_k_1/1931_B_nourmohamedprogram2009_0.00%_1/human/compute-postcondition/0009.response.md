Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0. If the current value of arr is a sorted list where each element is less than or equal to the next element, then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr such that the first element is greater than the second element, then 'NO' is being printed.***
