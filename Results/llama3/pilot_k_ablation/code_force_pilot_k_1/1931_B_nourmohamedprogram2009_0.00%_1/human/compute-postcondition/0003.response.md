Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0. The current value of arr is a sorted list where each element is less than or equal to the next element.**
