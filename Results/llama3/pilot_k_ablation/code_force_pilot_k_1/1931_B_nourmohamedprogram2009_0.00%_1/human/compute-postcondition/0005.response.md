Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 blocks of inputs. Each block contains an integer n and then a list of n integers. The sum of the integers in each block is divisible by n, n is an integer, arr is a sorted list of n integers. The current value of arr is sorted in ascending order, meaning each element in arr is less than or equal to the next element, and 'YES' is being printed**
