Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers in each test case are sorted in non-decreasing order and prints 'YES' if they are, and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
