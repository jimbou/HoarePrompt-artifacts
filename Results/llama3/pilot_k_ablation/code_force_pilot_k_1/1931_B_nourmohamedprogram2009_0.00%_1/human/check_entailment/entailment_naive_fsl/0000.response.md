Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the array and then checks if all elements are in non-decreasing order. However, this approach does not take into account the actual constraint of the problem, which is that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in each container and then check if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another. This can be done by checking if the sum of the amounts of water in each container is equal to the average amount of water multiplied by the number of containers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        avg = sum(arr) // n
        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] > avg:
                total += arr[i] - avg
            else:
                total -= avg - arr[i]
            if total < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This program correctly calculates the average amount of water in each container and then checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another. If the total amount of water that needs to be poured is negative at any point, it means that it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, and the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".
