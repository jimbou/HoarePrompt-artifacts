Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the array and then checks if all elements are in non-decreasing order. However, this approach does not take into account the actual constraint of the problem, which is that the sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "NO". This is because the sum of the amounts of water (1+2+3=6) is divisible by the number of containers (3), but it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water per container and then check if it is possible to make all containers have this average amount by pouring water from one container to another.
