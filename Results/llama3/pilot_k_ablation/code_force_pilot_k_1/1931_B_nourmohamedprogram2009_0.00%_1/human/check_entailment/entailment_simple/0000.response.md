Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program simply sorts the array and checks if it is non-decreasing. This is not sufficient to determine if the operation is possible.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in the containers and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal to the average by pouring water from one container to another.

Correctness: **False**
