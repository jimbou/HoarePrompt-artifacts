Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the array of water amounts and then checking if each amount is less than or equal to the next one. The idea behind this approach is that if the array is sorted and each amount is less than or equal to the next one, it means that we can pour water from the left containers to the right containers to make all amounts equal.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j. This means that we can only pour water from left to right, not from right to left. Therefore, sorting the array and checking if each amount is less than or equal to the next one is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all amounts equal.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. According to the program, this array is valid because each amount is less than or equal to the next one. However, it is not possible to make all amounts equal by pouring water from left to right. We would need to pour water from the right containers to the left containers, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
