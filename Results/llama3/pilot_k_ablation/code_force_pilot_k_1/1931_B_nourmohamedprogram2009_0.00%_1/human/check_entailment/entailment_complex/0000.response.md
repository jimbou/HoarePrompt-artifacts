Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program's approach is incorrect.

The program sorts the input array and then checks if it is sorted in ascending order. This is not a correct solution to the problem. The problem requires checking if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the index of the source container is less than the index of the destination container.

The program's approach does not take into account the constraint that the index of the source container must be less than the index of the destination container. It simply checks if the array is sorted in ascending order, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
