Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program simply checks if the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not the correct condition for the problem.

The correct condition is that the sum of the first i elements should be greater than or equal to i times the average water level for all i. This is because we can pour water from the i-th container to the j-th container only if i < j.

The program does not check this condition and instead relies solely on the sorting of the input array, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of making the water levels equal.

Correctness: **False**
