Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the array of water amounts and then checking if each element is less than or equal to the next one. The idea behind this approach is that if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, it means that we can pour water from the left containers to the right containers to make all containers have the same amount of water.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows pouring water from any container to any other container, not just from left to right. Therefore, sorting the array and checking for non-decreasing order is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which does not meet the condition of non-decreasing order. However, it is still possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from the containers with more water to the containers with less water.

A correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water per container and then check if it's possible to pour water from the containers with more water to the containers with less water to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Correctness: **False**
