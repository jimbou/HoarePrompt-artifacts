Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the array of water containers and then checking if each container has less than or equal to the amount of water in the next container. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem statement allows pouring water from one container to another as long as the source container has a lower index than the destination container. This means that the program should check if the cumulative sum of the water in the containers is less than or equal to the cumulative sum of the average water in the containers.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average water in each container and then check if the cumulative sum of the water in the containers is less than or equal to the cumulative sum of the average water in the containers.

Here is the correct code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        avg = sum(arr) // n
        cum_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            cum_sum += arr[i]
            if cum_sum > avg * (i + 1):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

Correctness: **False**
