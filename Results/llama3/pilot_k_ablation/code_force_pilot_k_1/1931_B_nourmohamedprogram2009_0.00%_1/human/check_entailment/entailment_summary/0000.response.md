Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The problem requires checking if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, which involves pouring water from one container to another. However, the program simply checks if the list of water amounts is sorted in ascending order, which is not a correct solution to the problem.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water that each container should have, and then check if it's possible to achieve this average by pouring water from one container to another. This can be done by iterating through the list of water amounts and checking if the cumulative sum is always greater than or equal to the average multiplied by the current index.

Correctness: **False**
