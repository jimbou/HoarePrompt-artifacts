Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two space-separated integers from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not changed by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
