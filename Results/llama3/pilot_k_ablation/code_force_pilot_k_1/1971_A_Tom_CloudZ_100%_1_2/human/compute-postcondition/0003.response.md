The `print` statement will print the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the minimum value will be the smaller of the two, and the maximum value will be the larger of the two.

Output: **min(a, b), max(a, b) (where min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers a and b, and max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers a and b)**
