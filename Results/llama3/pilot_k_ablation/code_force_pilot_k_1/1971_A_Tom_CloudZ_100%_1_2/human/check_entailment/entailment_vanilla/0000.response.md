Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterating through each test case.
2. In each test case, two integers x and y are read, and the minimum and maximum of these two integers need to be output.
3. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases (t) and then uses a for loop to iterate through each test case.
4. Inside the loop, the program reads two integers a and b using the `map()` function and the `split()` method, which is correct.
5. The program then uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum of a and b, respectively, and prints them.
6. The program does not handle any potential errors, such as invalid input, but since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this is not a concern.
7. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
