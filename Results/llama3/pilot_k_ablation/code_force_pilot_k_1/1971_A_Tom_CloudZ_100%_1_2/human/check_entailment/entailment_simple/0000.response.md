Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for multiple test cases. The program first reads the number of test cases t from the input, then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers x and y, and prints the minimum and maximum of these two integers.

The program uses the built-in min() and max() functions in Python, which correctly find the minimum and maximum of two integers, respectively. The program also correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
