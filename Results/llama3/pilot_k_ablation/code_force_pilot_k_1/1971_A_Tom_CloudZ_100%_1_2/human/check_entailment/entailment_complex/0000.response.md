Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer input, and print the minimum and maximum of each pair. The program correctly implements this functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 100.
2. The program then iterates `t` times, reading two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from the input, which are within the specified range of 0 to 9.
3. Inside the loop, the program correctly calculates and prints the minimum and maximum of the pair `a` and `b` using the built-in `min` and `max` functions.
4. The program does not contain any syntax errors, and the logic is straightforward and easy to follow.

Based on the provided execution states, the program behaves as expected, printing the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers from the original input.

Correctness: **True**
