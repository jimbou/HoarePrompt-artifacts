Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers and prints the minimum and maximum of these integers.

The program uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions in Python, which correctly handle all possible input cases. The `min` function returns the smallest of the input values, and the `max` function returns the largest of the input values.

The program does not have any logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles cases where the input integers are equal, as well as cases where they are different. It also handles the edge cases where the input integers are 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.
