Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it takes a series of pairs of integers as input and outputs the minimum and maximum of each pair. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers (a and b), calculates the minimum and maximum of the pair using the built-in min() and max() functions, and prints the result.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading pairs of integers and printing the minimum and maximum of each pair.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
