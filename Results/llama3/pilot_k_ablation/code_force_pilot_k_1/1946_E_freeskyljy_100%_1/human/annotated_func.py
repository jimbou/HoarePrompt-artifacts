#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a value based on the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, R, and MOD. It first checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if not, returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N, and if not, returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value using the function func_1 and the input parameters, and returns this value. The calculation involves multiplying the result of func_1 by a product of decreasing numbers, depending on the values of M1 and M2, and taking the result modulo MOD.
