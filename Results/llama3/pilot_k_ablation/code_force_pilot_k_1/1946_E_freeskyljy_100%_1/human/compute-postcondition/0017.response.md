Output State: **`N` is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input, `MOD` remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is equal to 1, and the last element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. Additionally, `ans` is equal to the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`, `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 2`, and `i` is equal to `L[-1] - 1`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2. `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to be the result of the previous value of `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` (which is `L[-1] - 2`) modulo `MOD`. The values of `cur`, `nums_left`, and `i` also remain unchanged.
