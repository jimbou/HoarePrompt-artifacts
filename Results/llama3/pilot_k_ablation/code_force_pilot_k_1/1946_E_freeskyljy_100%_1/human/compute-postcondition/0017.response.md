Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 2 and equal to the first input integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers equal to the first `M1` input integers, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers equal to the next `M2` input integers, `MOD` is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, `stdin` contains no inputs. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the last element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. The current value of `ans` is the result of `(func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)) * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`, and the current value of `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `i` is `L[-1] - 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of the expression `(func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)) * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
