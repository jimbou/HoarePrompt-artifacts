Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers equal to the first M1 input integers, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers equal to the next M2 input integers, MOD is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, stdin contains no inputs. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is equal to 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. The value of cur is equal to M2, i is equal to N, and nums_left is 0. If all elements of R are consecutive, then ans is the product of the initial value of ans and the factorial of N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD. If not all elements of R are consecutive, then ans is the product of the initial value of ans and the product of all numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, excluding the numbers that are in R, modulo MOD.**
