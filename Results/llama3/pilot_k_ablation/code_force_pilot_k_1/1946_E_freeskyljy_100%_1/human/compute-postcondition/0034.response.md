Output State: **The program returns ans, which is the product of the initial value of ans and either the factorial of N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD if all elements of R are consecutive, or the product of all numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, excluding the numbers that are in R, modulo MOD if not all elements of R are consecutive.**

In this output state, the value of ans depends on whether all elements of R are consecutive or not. If they are consecutive, ans is the product of the initial value of ans and the factorial of N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD. If they are not consecutive, ans is the product of the initial value of ans and the product of all numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, excluding the numbers that are in R, modulo MOD. The initial value of ans is either the result of func_1(N - 1, 1) if M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) if M2 is greater than 1.
