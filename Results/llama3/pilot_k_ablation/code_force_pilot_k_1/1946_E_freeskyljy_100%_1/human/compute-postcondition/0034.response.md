Output State: **The program returns the value of ans, which is a result of a complex calculation involving the values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and MOD. The exact value of ans depends on the values of M1 and M2. If M1 is greater than 2, ans is either the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by a product of decreasing numbers from L[-1] - 2 to 2, then multiplied by a product of decreasing numbers from N - R[0] - 1 to N - R[-1] - 1, all modulo MOD, or the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by a product of decreasing numbers from L[-1] - 2 to 2, all modulo MOD. If M1 is equal to 2, ans is either the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by a product of decreasing numbers from N - R[0] - 1 to N - R[-1] - 1, all modulo MOD, or the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1). If M1 is not greater than 1, the value of ans remains unchanged.**
