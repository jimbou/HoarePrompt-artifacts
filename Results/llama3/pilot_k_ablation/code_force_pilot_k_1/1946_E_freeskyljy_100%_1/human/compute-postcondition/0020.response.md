Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is equal to 1, and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. Additionally, if M1 is greater than 2 then ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD, cur is equal to 0, nums_left is equal to 0, and i is equal to 1. If M1 is equal to 2 then ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is equal to 0, nums_left is equal to 0, and i is equal to 1.**
