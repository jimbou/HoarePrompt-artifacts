Output State: **`N` is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, `M1` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers equal to the first `M1` input integers, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers equal to the next `M2` input integers, `MOD` is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, `ans` is the product of the initial value of `ans` and `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `i` is `R[0] + 1`. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the last element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of its initial value and `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
