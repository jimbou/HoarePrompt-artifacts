Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than 2 and equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers equal to the first M1 input integers, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers equal to the next M2 input integers, MOD is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, stdin contains no inputs. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is equal to 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then the current value of ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), and the current value of cur is M1 - 3. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the result of (func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)) * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD, and the current value of cur is M1 - 2. In both cases, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is L[-1] - 2.**
