To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i > 1`. Given the current state, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and we know that `L[-1]` is equal to the first element of `R`, which in turn is equal to `N`. However, to guarantee that `i > 1`, we must ensure that `L[-1]` (or `N`) is greater than 2.

Since `N` is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, and we need `N` to be greater than 2 to satisfy the loop condition, we adjust the state of `N` to reflect this requirement.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 2 and equal to the first input integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers equal to the first `M1` input integers, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers equal to the next `M2` input integers, `MOD` is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, `stdin` contains no inputs. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the last element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. The current value of `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and the current value of `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `i` is `L[-1] - 1**
