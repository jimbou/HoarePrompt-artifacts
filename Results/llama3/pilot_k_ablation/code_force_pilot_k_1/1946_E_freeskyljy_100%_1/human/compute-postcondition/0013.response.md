To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `i > 1`. Given the state right before the loop, `i` is equal to `L[-1] - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1.

Since `L[-1]` is the last element of list `L`, and it is also equal to the first element of list `R`, and the last element of `R` is equal to `N`, we can infer that `L[-1]` is a positive integer less than or equal to `N`.

However, the current state of `i` being equal to `L[-1] - 1` does not guarantee that `i` is greater than 1. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `L[-1]` such that `L[-1] - 1` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state of `L[-1]` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2.

State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is equal to 1, and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. Additionally, the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), and the current value of cur is equal to M1 - 2. nums_left is equal to L[-1] - 2, and i is equal to L[-1] - 1, and L[-1] must be greater than 2.**
