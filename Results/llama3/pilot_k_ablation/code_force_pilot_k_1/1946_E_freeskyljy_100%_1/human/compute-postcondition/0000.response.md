Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers equal to the first M1 input integers, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers equal to the next M2 input integers, MOD is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, stdin contains no inputs.**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to N, M1, and M2, respectively. Then, it reads M1 distinct positive integers from stdin and assigns them to L, and M2 distinct positive integers from stdin and assigns them to R. After executing the code, stdin is empty. The value of MOD remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
