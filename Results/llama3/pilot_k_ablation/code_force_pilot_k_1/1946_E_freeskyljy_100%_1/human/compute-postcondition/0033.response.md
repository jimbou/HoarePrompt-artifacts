Postcondition: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is equal to 1, and the last element of R is equal to N. If M1 is greater than 1, then either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. Additionally, if M1 is greater than 2, then either M2 is greater than 1 and the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * (N - R[-1] - 1) % MOD, the current value of cur is equal to M2 + 1, the current value of nums_left is equal to 0, and the current value of i is equal to N, or M2 is not greater than 1 and the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD, the current value of cur is equal to 0, the current value of nums_left is equal to N - R[0] - 1, and the current value of i is equal to 1. If M1 is equal to 2, then either M2 is greater than 1 and the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * (N - R[-1] - 1) % MOD, the current value of cur is equal to M2 + 1, the current value of nums_left is equal to 0, and the current value of i is equal to N, or M2 is not greater than 1 and the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), the current value of cur is equal to 0, the current value of nums_left is equal to N - R[0] - 1, and the current value of i is equal to 1. If M1 is not greater than 1, then the values of ans, cur, nums_left, and i are not changed.**
