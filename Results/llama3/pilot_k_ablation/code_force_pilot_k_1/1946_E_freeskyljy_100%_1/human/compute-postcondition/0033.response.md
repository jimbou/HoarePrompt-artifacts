Postcondition: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers equal to the first M1 input integers, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers equal to the next M2 input integers, MOD is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, stdin contains no inputs. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is equal to 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M2 is greater than 1, then the value of cur is equal to M2, i is equal to N, and nums_left is 0. If all elements of R are consecutive, then ans is the product of the initial value of ans and the factorial of N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD. If not all elements of R are consecutive, then ans is the product of the initial value of ans and the product of all numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, excluding the numbers that are in R, modulo MOD. If M2 is less than or equal to 1, then the current value of ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, 1), and the current value of cur is -1. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), and the current value of cur is M1 - 2. In both cases, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, and i is 1.**
