Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers equal to the first M1 input integers, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers equal to the next M2 input integers, MOD is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, stdin contains no inputs. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is equal to 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. The current value of ans is unchanged, and the current value of cur is 2. nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, and the current value of i is R[1].**

In natural language, the output state is: N, M1, M2, L, R, MOD, and stdin remain unchanged. The last element of L is still equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is still 1, and the last element of R is still N. The second last element of L is still not equal to the second element of R. The value of ans is still unchanged, but the value of cur has been incremented by 1 and is now 2. The value of nums_left is still N - R[0] - 1, and the value of i has been updated to R[1].
