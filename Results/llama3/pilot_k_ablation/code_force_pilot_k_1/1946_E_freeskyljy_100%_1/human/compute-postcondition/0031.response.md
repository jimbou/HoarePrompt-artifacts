Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is equal to 1, and the last element of R is equal to N. If M1 is greater than 1, then either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. Additionally, if M1 is greater than 2, then the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD, the current value of cur is equal to 2, the current value of nums_left is equal to N - R[0] - 2, and the current value of i is equal to R[1] + 1. If M1 is equal to 2, then the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), the current value of cur is equal to 2, the current value of nums_left is equal to N - R[0] - 2, and the current value of i is equal to R[1] + 1. If M1 is not greater than 1, then the values of ans, cur, nums_left, and i are not changed. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, cur is reset to 1, nums_left is decremented by 1, and i is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and MOD remain unchanged. The last element of L is still equal to the first element of R, and the first element of L is still equal to 1. The last element of R is still equal to N. If M1 is greater than 1, then either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M1 is greater than 2, then the value of ans is updated to be the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all integers from 2 to L[-1] - 1 modulo MOD. The value of cur is still equal to 2, and the value of nums_left is decremented by 1 to be N - R[0] - 2. The value of i is incremented by 1 to be R[1] + 1. If M1 is equal to 2, then the value of ans is updated to be the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), and the values of cur, nums_left, and i are updated similarly. If M1 is not greater than 1, then the values of ans, cur, nums_left, and i are not changed. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, cur is reset to 1, nums_left is decremented by 1, and i is incremented by 1.
