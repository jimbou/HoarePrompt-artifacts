Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers equal to the first M1 input integers, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers equal to the next M2 input integers, MOD is a positive integer unchanged from its initial value, stdin contains no inputs. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is equal to 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then the current value of cur is 2, and the current value of i is R[1]. Otherwise, ans is the product of the initial value of ans and N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, cur is 1, and i is R[0] + 1. nums_left is one less than its initial value, and i is one more than its initial value.**
