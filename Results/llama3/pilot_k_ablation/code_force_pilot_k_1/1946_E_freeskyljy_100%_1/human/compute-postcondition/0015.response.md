Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is equal to 1, and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. Additionally, the current value of ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), and the current value of cur is equal to M1 - 3, nums_left is equal to L[-1] - 2, and the current value of i is equal to the element at index cur in list L.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `cur` being equal to `M1 - 3`. The value of `i` is still equal to the element at index `cur` in list `L`, but since `cur` has changed, the value of `i` is now equal to the element at index `M1 - 3` in list `L`. All other variables remain unchanged.
