Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is equal to 1, and the last element of R is equal to N. If M1 is greater than 1, then either M2 is not greater than 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. Additionally, if M1 is greater than 2, then ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD, cur is equal to 0, nums_left is equal to N - R[0] - 1, and i is equal to 1. If M1 is equal to 2, then ans is equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is equal to 0, nums_left is equal to N - R[0] - 1, and i is equal to 1. If M1 is not greater than 1, then the values of ans, cur, nums_left, and i are not changed.**

In natural language, the output state is: N, M1, M2, L, R, and MOD remain unchanged. The last element of L is still equal to the first element of R, and the first element of L is still equal to 1. The last element of R is still equal to N. The relationship between M1 and M2 is still maintained. The values of ans, cur, and i are updated based on the value of M1. If M1 is greater than 2, then ans is calculated using the result of func_1, and cur and i are set to 0 and 1, respectively. If M1 is equal to 2, then ans is calculated using the result of func_1, and cur and i are set to 0 and 1, respectively. If M1 is not greater than 1, then the values of ans, cur, and i are not changed. The value of nums_left is updated to N - R[0] - 1.
