Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program first checks if the last element of the prefix maximums is equal to the first element of the suffix maximums. If not, it returns 0, as this is a necessary condition for the permutation to be valid.

Then, it checks if the first element of the prefix maximums is 1 and the last element of the suffix maximums is N. If not, it returns 0, as these are also necessary conditions for the permutation to be valid.

Next, it checks if M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and if the second last element of the prefix maximums is equal to the second element of the suffix maximums. If all these conditions are true, it returns 0, as this would mean that the permutation is not valid.

After these checks, the program calculates the number of permutations using the function func_1. This function calculates the number of permutations based on the number of elements to the left and right of the maximum element.

Finally, the program returns the calculated number of permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Correctness: **True**
