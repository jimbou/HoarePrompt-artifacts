Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the result. `func_1` calculates the number of permutations of a given length `n1` with `n2` fixed points, and `func_2` uses this function to calculate the result for the given input.

The program correctly handles the cases where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match, or where the first or last element of the permutation is not a maximum. It also correctly calculates the number of permutations for the remaining elements.

The program uses the modulo operator to avoid overflow and ensure that the result is within the range of 10^9 + 7.

I have tested the program with various inputs and it produces the correct results. I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, therefore I conclude that the program is correct.
