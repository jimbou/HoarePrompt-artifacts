Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly handles the cases where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match, and it correctly calculates the number of permutations that could have been guessed.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of permutations. `func_1` calculates the number of permutations for a given range, and `func_2` uses this function to calculate the total number of permutations based on the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match, or when the prefix maximums or suffix maximums are not in the correct order.

I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Note: The program uses a modulo operation to prevent overflow, which is a good practice when dealing with large numbers. The modulo operation is used to calculate the result modulo 10^9 + 7, which is a common technique used in competitive programming to prevent overflow.
