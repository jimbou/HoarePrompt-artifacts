Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of permutations of a given length `n1` with `n2` fixed points, and `func_2` is the main function that solves the problem.

2. In `func_2`, the program first reads the input values `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. The program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum. If not, it returns 0, as this is a necessary condition for the permutation to be valid.

4. The program then checks if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `N`. If not, it returns 0, as these are also necessary conditions for the permutation to be valid.

5. If `M1` and `M2` are both greater than 1, the program checks if the second last prefix maximum is equal to the second suffix maximum. If so, it returns 0, as this would mean that the permutation has two maximums at the same position, which is not possible.

6. The program then calculates the number of permutations using `func_1` and updates the result based on the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

7. Finally, the program returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Based on the above analysis, the program seems to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
