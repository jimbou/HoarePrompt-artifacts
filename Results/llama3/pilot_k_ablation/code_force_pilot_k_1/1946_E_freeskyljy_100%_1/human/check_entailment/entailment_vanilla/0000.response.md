Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the number of permutations of a given length n, with a specific number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. It uses the formula for combinations to calculate this number.

`func_2` is the main function that reads the input and calculates the number of suitable permutations. It first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If these conditions are not met, it returns 0. It then checks if the second last prefix maximum is equal to the second suffix maximum, and if so, returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations using `func_1` and then adjusts this number based on the remaining prefix and suffix maximums.

The program uses a modulo operation to prevent overflow, with a modulus of 10^9 + 7.

Based on the provided problem description and the code, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums, and it handles the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
