Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, where n1 and n2 are non-negative integers and n2 <= n1. This function is used in func_2 to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

func_2 takes the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R, and calculates the number of suitable permutations based on these parameters. It first checks for some invalid cases and returns 0 if any of these conditions are met. Otherwise, it calculates the result using the function func_1 and the input parameters, and returns this value.

The program uses the execution summaries of the functions as guides to understand the program's behavior. The execution summaries provide hints about the output of each function, which helps to understand how the program works.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of suitable permutations based on the input parameters, and it handles invalid cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
