Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

2. Function `func_1` calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, which is used in the calculation of permutations.

3. Function `func_2` takes the input values N, M1, M2, L, and R, and checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If these conditions are not met, it returns 0.

4. If M1 is greater than 1, `func_2` calculates the product of numbers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1, excluding the numbers that are in L. This is done to calculate the number of permutations for the left side of the prefix maximums.

5. If M2 is greater than 1, `func_2` calculates the product of numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, excluding the numbers that are in R. This is done to calculate the number of permutations for the right side of the suffix maximums.

6. The function returns the product of these two calculations modulo MOD, or 0 if any of the initial conditions are not met.

7. The program iterates over the input test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case, printing the result.

Based on the execution summaries, the program correctly calculates the number of permutations that meet the given conditions and returns the result modulo MOD. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
