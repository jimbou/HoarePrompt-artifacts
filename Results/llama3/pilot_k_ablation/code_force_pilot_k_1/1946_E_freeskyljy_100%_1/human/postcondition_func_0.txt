This function calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, where n1 and n2 are non-negative integers and MOD is a positive integer. If n1 equals n2 or n2 equals 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it computes the product of the factorial of n1 modulo MOD and the modular multiplicative inverse of the product of the factorial of n2 modulo MOD and the factorial of n1 - n2 modulo MOD, all taken modulo MOD.
