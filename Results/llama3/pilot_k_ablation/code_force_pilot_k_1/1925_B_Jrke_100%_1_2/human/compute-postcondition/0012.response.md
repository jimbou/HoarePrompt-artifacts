Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1, and the integer division of `x` by `i` if the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.***
