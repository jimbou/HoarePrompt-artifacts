The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains an integer t that is at least 1 and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t that is at least 1, _ is 0**
