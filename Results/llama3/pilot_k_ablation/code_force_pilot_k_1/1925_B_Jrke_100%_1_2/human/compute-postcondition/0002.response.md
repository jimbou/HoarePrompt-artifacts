To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0, because `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` will be at least 2, allowing `i` to take on the value 1.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
