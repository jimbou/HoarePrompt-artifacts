Output State: **x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

The code block reads an integer t from stdin, which is at least 1, and assigns it to the variable x. It then reads another integer n from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. The third line calculates the integer division of x by n and assigns the result to the variable k. The fourth line assigns the value 1 to the variable ans. The variable _ remains unchanged with a value of 0. After the code block executes, stdin is empty.
