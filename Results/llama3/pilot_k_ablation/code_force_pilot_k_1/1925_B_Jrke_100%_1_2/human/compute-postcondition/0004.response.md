Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the addition of a new variable `l`, which is a list containing the value of `ans`, which is 1. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, which is 1.
