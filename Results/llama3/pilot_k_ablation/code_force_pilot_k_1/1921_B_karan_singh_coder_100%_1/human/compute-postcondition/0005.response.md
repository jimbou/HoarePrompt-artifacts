The code prints the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Where `a` is the number of positions where string `s` is greater than string `t`, and `b` is the number of positions where string `s` is less than string `t`.
Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the number of positions where s is greater than t, and b is the number of positions where s is less than t)**
