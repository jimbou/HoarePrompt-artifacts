The code prints the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Where `a` is the number of positions where `s` has a '1' and `t` has a '0' at the same position, and `b` is the number of positions where `s` has a '0' and `t` has a '1' at the same position.
Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the number of positions where s has a '1' and t has a '0' at the same position, and b is the number of positions where s has a '0' and t has a '1' at the same position)**
