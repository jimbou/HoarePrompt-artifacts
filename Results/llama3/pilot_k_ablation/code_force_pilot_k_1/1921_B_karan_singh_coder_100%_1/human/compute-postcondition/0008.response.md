Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two binary strings s and t of length n. It then compares the strings character by character, counting the number of positions where s is greater than t (a) and the number of positions where s is less than t (b). Finally, it prints the maximum of a and b for each test case, effectively determining the maximum number of positions where one string is lexicographically greater than the other.**
