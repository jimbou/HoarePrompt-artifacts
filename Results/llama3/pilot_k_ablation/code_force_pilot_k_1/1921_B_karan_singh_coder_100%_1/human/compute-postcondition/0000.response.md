To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is an integer `t` in the input that is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t that must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
