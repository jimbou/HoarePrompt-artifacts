Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second and third lines contain two strings s and f of length n, consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
