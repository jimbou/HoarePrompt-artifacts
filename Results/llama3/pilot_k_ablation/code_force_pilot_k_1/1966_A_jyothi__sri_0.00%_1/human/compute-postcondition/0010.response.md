Postcondition: ***`t` is reduced by 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that is not empty, `ans` is equal to n, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If the first integer `i` in the list is already in the dictionary `h`, then the value of `i` in `h` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `h` with a value of 1. If the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to k-1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ams`.***
