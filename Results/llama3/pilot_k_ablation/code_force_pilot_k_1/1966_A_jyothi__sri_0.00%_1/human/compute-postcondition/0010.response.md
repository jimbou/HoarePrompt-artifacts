Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin is empty, _ is 0, ans is equal to n. If the first integer in the list a is already a key in dictionary h and its value is greater than or equal to k, then ans is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
