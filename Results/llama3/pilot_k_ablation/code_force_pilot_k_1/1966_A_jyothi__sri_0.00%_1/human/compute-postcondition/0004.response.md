Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that is not empty, `h` is a dictionary that contains at least one key which is the first integer `i` in the list and the value of `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to n, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of `i` is in the dictionary `h`**

The value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1, which means the count of the first integer `i` in the list `a` is increased by 1 in the dictionary `h`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
