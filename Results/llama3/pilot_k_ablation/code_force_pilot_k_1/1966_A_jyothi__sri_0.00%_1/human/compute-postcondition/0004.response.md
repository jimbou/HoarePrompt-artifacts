The code `h[i] += 1` increments the value of `h[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `a` and is also a key in dictionary `h`, the value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer of list `a` with its value incremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list and is also a key in dictionary `h` with its value in `h` incremented by 1, stdin is empty.**
