Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum of n and k-1, and prints this value. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables n, k, and ans with the values from the last test case.**
