The code `h[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `h`. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `a` and is not in `h` initially, this operation adds a new key-value pair to `h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `a` and the value is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.**
