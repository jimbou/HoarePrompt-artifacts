The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) that must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
