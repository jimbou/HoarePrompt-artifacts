Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a = 3 and b = 1. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the 3x1 rectangle into two 1x1 rectangles and then form a 1x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x1 rectangle. However, the program will output "no" for this case, which is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if a or b is even and if the other dimension is not equal to half of the even dimension. However, this is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The program needs to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and form another rectangle, not just the cases where a or b is even.
