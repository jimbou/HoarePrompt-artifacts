Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks three conditions:

1. If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles, and these two rectangles can be combined to form a different rectangle.

2. If only one of a or b is even, and the even number is not equal to twice the odd number, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with different sizes, and these two rectangles can be combined to form a different rectangle.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with different sizes.

This logic is correct based on the problem description, and the program correctly implements this logic.

Correctness: **True**
