Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

The program checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. If one of `a` or `b` is even and the other is not, it checks if the even side can be divided into two equal parts that are not equal to the other side. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
