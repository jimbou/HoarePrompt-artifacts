Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming a new rectangle from these two rectangles.

The program uses the parity of the sides of the rectangle to determine whether another rectangle can be formed. If both sides are even, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles and then formed into a new rectangle. If one side is even and the other side is odd, it checks if the even side is not equal to twice the odd side. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then formed into a new rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The execution summary shows that the program processes all input pairs and empties the standard input buffer, leaving the last pair of integers and the number of processed pairs as the final state.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the two sides are equal. In this case, the program should print 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then formed into a new rectangle. But the program prints 'yes' in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
