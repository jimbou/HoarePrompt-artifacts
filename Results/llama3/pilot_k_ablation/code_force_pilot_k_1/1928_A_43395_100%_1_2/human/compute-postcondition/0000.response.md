The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the input from `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed, the input from `stdin` must be an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `i` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), i is 0**
