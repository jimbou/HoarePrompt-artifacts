Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, determines whether each pair meets certain parity conditions, and prints 'yes' if the conditions are met and 'no' otherwise. The function processes all input pairs and empties the standard input buffer, leaving the last pair of integers and the number of processed pairs as the final state.**
