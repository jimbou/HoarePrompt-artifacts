Output: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). Either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd. Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd or both are odd, and if `a` is even then `a / 2` equals `b` and if `b` is even then `b / 2` equals `a`, and 'no' is being printed**
