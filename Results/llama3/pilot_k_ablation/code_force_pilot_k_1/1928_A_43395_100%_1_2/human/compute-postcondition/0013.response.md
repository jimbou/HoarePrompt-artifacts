Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, then 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd, or if one is even and not equal to twice the other, then 'yes' is printed. If `a` is even and equals twice `b`, or if `b` is even and equals twice `a`, then 'no' is printed.***
