Output State: **userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 letter, list(userString) is a list of characters in userString, countA is 0, countB is 0, letter is the first letter in the userString, the first letter of userString is not 'A', and the letter is not 'B' and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration, so no changes are made to the variables.
