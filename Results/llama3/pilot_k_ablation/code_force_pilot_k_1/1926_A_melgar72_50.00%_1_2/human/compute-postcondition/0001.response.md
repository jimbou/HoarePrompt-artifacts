The only variable in the loop head is variable  letter and userString, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the userString.  If the userString has at least 1 letter the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, countA is 0 and countB is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the userString must have at least 1 letter and the letter is the first letter in the userString.
State: **userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 letter, list(userString) is a list of characters in userString, countA is 0, countB is 0, letter is the first letter in the userString**
