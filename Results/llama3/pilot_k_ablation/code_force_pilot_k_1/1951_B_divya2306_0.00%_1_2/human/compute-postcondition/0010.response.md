Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, `wins - 1` is printed, where `wins - 1` is at least `k - 1`.***
