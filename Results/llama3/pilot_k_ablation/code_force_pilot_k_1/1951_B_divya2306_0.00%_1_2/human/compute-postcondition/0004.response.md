Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `wins` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
