Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[k - 1]` is at least the second smallest element, `wins_with_swap` is at least 1 less than `k - 1`, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
