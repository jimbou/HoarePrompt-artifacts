Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus the number of elements in the range from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` in the range from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1` or `k - 1` if no such element exists.**
