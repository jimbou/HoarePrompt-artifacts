Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `wins` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `wins` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the current value of `a[i]` and `a[k - 1]` is still applicable, and if the condition is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
