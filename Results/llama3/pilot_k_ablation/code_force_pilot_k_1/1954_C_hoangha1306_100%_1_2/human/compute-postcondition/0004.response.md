Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t-2` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `q` is 0, `a` is a string containing a pair of integers `x` and `y` that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string containing a pair of integers `x` and `y`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`***
