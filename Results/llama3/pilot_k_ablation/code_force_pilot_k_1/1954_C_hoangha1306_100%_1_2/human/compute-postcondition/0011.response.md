Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, q is 0, a is a string containing a pair of integers x and y that must have at least 1 character, b is a string containing a pair of integers x and y, kq1 is a string containing the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 is a string containing the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], vt is not equal to 0, i is 0, a[i] is not equal to b[i], x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i].**

In this output state, the values of `kq1` and `kq2` have been updated to contain the maximum and minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
