Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin is empty, q is t-1, a is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y, b is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y, kq1 is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the minimum/maximum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b, kq2 is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the maximum/minimum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b, vt is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the loop executed at least once and found a mismatch between a and b, and t pairs of strings kq1 and kq2 are printed (where kq1 and kq2 are strings containing pairs of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the minimum/maximum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b)**
