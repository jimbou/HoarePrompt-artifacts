Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, q is 0, a is a string containing a pair of integers x and y that must have at least 1 character, b is a string containing a pair of integers x and y, kq1 is a string containing the character at index i of a, kq2 is a string containing the character at index i of a, vt is 0, i is 0.**

The code snippet appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to both `kq1` and `kq2`. Since `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, both `kq1` and `kq2` will contain the same character. The `continue` statement does not affect the state of any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
