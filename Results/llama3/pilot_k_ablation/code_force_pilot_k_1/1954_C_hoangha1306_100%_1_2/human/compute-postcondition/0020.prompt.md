You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        kq1 = ''
        
        kq2 = ''
        
        vt = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        
        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin is empty, q is t-1, a is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y, b is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y, kq1 is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the minimum/maximum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b, kq2 is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the maximum/minimum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b, vt is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the loop executed at least once and found a mismatch between a and b, and t pairs of strings kq1 and kq2 are printed (where kq1 and kq2 are strings containing pairs of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the minimum/maximum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b)

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin is empty, q is t-1, a is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y, b is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y, kq1 is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the minimum/maximum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b, kq2 is a string containing the last pair of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the maximum/minimum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b, vt is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the loop executed at least once and found a mismatch between a and b, and t pairs of strings kq1 and kq2 are printed (where kq1 and kq2 are strings containing pairs of integers x and y where each character is either equal to the corresponding character in a or the minimum/maximum of the integer values of the corresponding characters in a and b)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
