The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits.**
