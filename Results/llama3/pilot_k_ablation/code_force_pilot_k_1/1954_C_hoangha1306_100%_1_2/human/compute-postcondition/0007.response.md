Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t-2` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `q` is 0, `a` is a string containing a pair of integers `x` and `y` that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string containing a pair of integers `x` and `y`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are determined by comparing the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `x` will be the smaller of the two integer values, and `y` will be the larger of the two integer values. The other variables remain unchanged.
