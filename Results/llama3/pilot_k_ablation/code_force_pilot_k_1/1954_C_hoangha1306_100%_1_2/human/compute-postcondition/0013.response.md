Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, q is 0, a is a string containing a pair of integers x and y that must have at least 1 character, b is a string containing a pair of integers x and y. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 contains the character at index i of a and kq2 contains the character at index i of a. Otherwise, if vt is 0, kq1 contains the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 contains the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and vt is 1. If vt is not equal to 0, kq1 contains the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 contains the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and vt is not equal to 0. In all cases, i is 0.***
