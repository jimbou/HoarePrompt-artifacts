Output State: **`ii` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` repeated `n-1` times, `k` is either `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[0] % m` or `(a[l] % m) * a[0] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is either `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[n-2] % m` or `(a[l] % m) * a[n-2] % m`, `q1` is either `-1` or `0`, `q2` is either `n` or `n+1`, and `i` is `-1`.**
