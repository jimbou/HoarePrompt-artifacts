Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a string representation of `k`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` or `a[l] % m`, `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1`, `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1`, and `i` is `n - 2`. The current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**
