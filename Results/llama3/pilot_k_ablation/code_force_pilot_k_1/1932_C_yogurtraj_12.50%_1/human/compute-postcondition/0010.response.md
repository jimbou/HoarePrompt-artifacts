Output State: **ii is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a string representation of k, k is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1, q2 is either l + 1 or l + 2, and i is n - 2. The current value of t[i] is 'R'. Stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by multiplying it with `a[q2]` and taking the modulus `m`. The value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
