To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the input from `stdin` contains an integer `t` that is greater than 0. This is because the loop iterates `t` times.

Before the loop starts, the state is that `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. However, this does not guarantee that the loop will execute, as `t` could be 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Additionally, since `ii` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 0, as it will be incremented in each iteration.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` that is greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
