The only variable in the loop head is variable `ii` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must contain an integer t that is greater than 0 and ii is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, ii is 0, t must be greater than 0**
