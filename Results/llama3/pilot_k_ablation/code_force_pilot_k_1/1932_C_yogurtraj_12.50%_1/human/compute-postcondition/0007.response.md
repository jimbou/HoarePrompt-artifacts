Output State: **n and m are integers, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise k is the remainder of the lth element of a divided by m, q1 is l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 1, ii is 0, y is a string representation of k, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, a, t, l, k, q1, q2, and ii remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that a new variable y is introduced, which is a string representation of the value of k. The stdin remains empty.
