Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, i is n - 2, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a multiplied by the lth element of a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', otherwise k is the remainder of the lth element of a multiplied by the (l+1)th element of a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', otherwise k is the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a multiplied by the (l-2)th element of a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', otherwise k is the remainder of the lth element of a multiplied by the (l-1)th element of a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', q1 is l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', otherwise q1 is l - 1 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', otherwise q1 is l - 3 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', otherwise q1 is l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', q2 is l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', otherwise q2 is l + 2 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', otherwise q2 is l if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is 'R', otherwise q2 is l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L' and t[i] is not 'R', ii is 0, y is a string representation of the new value of k, and stdin is empty.***
