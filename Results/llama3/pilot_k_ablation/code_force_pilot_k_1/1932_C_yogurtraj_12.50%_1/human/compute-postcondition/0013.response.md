Postcondition: **ii is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a string representation of k, k is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if t[i] is 'R', otherwise k is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m or (a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m, q1 is either l - 2, l - 1, l - 3, or l - 2, q2 is either l, l + 1, l + 1, or l + 2, and i is n - 2.**
