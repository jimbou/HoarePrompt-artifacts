Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, n integers a_1 to a_n, and a string s of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. The function then performs calculations based on the input values and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function leaves stdin empty and all variables used within the function are undefined.**
