Postcondition: ***ii is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t. If the last character of t is 'L', then k is the remainder of a[l - 1] divided by m, q1 is l - 2, and q2 is l. If the last character of t is not 'L', then k is a[l] % m, q1 is l - 1, and q2 is l + 1.***
