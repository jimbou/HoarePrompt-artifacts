Postcondition: ***n and m are integers, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise k is the remainder of the lth element of a divided by m, q1 is l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 1, ii is 0, and stdin is empty.***
