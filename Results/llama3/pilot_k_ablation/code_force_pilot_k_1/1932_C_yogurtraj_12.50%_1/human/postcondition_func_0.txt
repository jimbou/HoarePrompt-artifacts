The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string of 'L' and 'R' characters, followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values by iteratively multiplying the current value with the corresponding integer from the list, based on the direction ('L' or 'R') in the string, and taking the result modulo m. The function then prints the calculated sequence in reverse order, separated by spaces. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and all local variables undefined.
