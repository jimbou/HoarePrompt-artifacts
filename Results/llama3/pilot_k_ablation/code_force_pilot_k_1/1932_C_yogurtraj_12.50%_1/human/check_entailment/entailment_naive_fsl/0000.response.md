Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

    4
    4 6
    3 1 4 2
    LLRR

The program will output:

    0 2 4 1

However, the correct output should be:

    0 2 4 4

This is because when the command is 'L', the program should remove the leftmost element from the array, but in the given code, it removes the element at index `l-1` instead of `l`. Similarly, when the command is 'R', the program should remove the rightmost element from the array, but in the given code, it removes the element at index `l` instead of `l+1`.

The program also does not handle the case when the input array `a` contains zeros. In this case, the product of all elements of the array will be zero, and the program should output zeros for all commands. However, the given code does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
