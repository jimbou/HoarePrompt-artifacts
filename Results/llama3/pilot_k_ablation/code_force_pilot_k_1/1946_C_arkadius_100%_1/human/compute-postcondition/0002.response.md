Output State: **n is at least 2, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes and an additional edge between nodes u-1 and v-1, i is 1, u and v are integers, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, adds an edge to the tree between the nodes corresponding to these integers (minus one), and assigns the values of the input integers to the variables u and v. The values of n, k, and i remain unchanged. The tree object is modified by adding a new edge, but its number of nodes remains the same. Stdin is left empty after the input is read.
