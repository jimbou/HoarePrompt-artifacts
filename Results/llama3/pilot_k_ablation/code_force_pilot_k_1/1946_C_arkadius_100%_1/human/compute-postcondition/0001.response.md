According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k` < `n`, and `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is now 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes, `i` is 1**
