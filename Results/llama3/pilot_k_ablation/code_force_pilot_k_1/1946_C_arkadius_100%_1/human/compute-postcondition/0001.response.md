The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 2 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes, i is 1**
