Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root of the tree, `x` is a positive integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary, `v` is the root of the tree `s`, `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child. The remaining size of `u` is less than `x`***
