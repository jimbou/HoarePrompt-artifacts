Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is a vertex in the `tree`, `x` is a positive integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and its value is the sum of its own previous value and the value of its first child `u`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary, `v` is equal to `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`, and the value of `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`***
