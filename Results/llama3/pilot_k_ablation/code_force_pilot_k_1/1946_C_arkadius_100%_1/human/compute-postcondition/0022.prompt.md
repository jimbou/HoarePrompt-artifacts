You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, s is a vertex in the tree, and x is a positive integer.
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: `tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is a vertex in the `tree`, `x` is a positive integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the tree and its value is the sum of the good components of its children plus one if the remaining size of any child is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value is the sum of the good components of its children, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the tree and its value is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children if the remaining size of any child is less than `x`.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the sum of the good components of the children of vertex `s` in the tree, plus one if the remaining size of any child is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the sum of the good components of its children. The second value is the sum of the remaining sizes of the children of vertex `s` if the remaining size of any child is less than `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the sum of the good components of the children of vertex `s` in the tree, plus one if the remaining size of any child is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the sum of the good components of its children. The second value is the sum of the remaining sizes of the children of vertex `s` if the remaining size of any child is less than `x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
