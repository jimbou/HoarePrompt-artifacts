Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is a vertex in the `tree`, `x` is a positive integer, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and its value is the sum of its own previous value plus one and the value of its first child `u`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary, `v` is equal to `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`. The current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure and the values of `s`, `x`, `stack`, `remaining_size`, `v`, `postorder`, `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `u` remain the same. The value of `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1.
