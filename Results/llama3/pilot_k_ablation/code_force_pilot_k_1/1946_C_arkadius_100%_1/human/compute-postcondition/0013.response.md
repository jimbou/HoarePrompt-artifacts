Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the number of connected components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex with a size of at least a specified minimum size, and the total size of the connected components in the subtree with a size less than the minimum size. It traverses the subtree, recursively processing the children of the given vertex, and aggregates the results to provide the total count of good components and the remaining size.**
