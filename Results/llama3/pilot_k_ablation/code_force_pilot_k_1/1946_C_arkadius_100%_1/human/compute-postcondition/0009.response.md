Output State: **The program returns the smallest value 'beg' for which 'func_3(tree, n, k, beg)' returns True, where 'tree' is a valid tree data structure with 'n' vertices, 'n' is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, 'k' is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, such that 0 <= 'k' < 'n'. If no such 'beg' exists, 'beg' is 'n'.**
