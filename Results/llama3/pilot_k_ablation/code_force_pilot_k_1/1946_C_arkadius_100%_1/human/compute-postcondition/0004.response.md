Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `tree` is a Tree object with n nodes and n-1 additional edges, `i` is n-1, stdin contains n-1 less input: n-1 space-separated pairs of integers, and the root of the tree has been visited and processed non-recursively.**

In this output state, the `tree` object has been modified by calling the `root_tree_non_recursive` method on it, starting from node 0 and considering -1 as its parent. This method has likely performed some operation on the tree, but the exact nature of this operation is not specified. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 less input: n-1 space-separated pairs of integers.
