Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the number of good components and the total size of subtrees with a size less than a given threshold 'x' in a tree data structure rooted at 's'. A good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to 'x'. The function traverses the tree, aggregating the count of good components and the total size of smaller subtrees for each vertex, ultimately returning these values for the root vertex 's'.**
