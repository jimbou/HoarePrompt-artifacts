Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**.

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, their values are updated accordingly. The second line creates a `Tree` object with `n` nodes and assigns it to the variable `tree`. No other variables are affected.
