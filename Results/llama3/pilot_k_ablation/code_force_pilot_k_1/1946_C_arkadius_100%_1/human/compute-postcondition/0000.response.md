Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**.

The first line of the code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. Since n and k are already defined as positive integers such that k < n, this line does not change their values or relationship. The second line creates a new Tree object with n nodes and assigns it to the variable tree. This line introduces a new variable, tree, which is a Tree object with n nodes. The previous values of n and k remain unchanged.
