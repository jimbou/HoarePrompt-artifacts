Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the number of good components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree, where a good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size x. Additionally, it returns the remaining size, which is 1 plus the sum of the sizes of the subtrees rooted at the children of v that are less than x. The function traverses the subtree rooted at v, recursively calculating the number of good components and remaining size for each child subtree, and aggregates these values to determine the total number of good components and remaining size for the subtree rooted at v.**
