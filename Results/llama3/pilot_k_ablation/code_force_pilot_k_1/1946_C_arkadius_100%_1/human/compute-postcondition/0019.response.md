Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is a vertex in the `tree`, `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` and tuples `(u, False)` for all children `u` of `v`, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and 0 as its value, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and 1 as its value. If `postorder` is `True`, then `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the tree and its value is the sum of the good components of its children plus one if the remaining size of any child is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value is the sum of the good components of its children, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the tree and its value is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children if the remaining size of any child is less than `x`.***
