Postcondition: ***tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, s is the root of the tree, x is a positive integer, v is the root of the tree s. If postorder is False, then stack is a list containing tuples (u, False) for all children u of the root v, good_components is a dictionary with one key-value pair {v: 0}, remaining_size is a dictionary with one key-value pair {v: 1}, and tree.vertices[v].children is either empty or has been fully traversed. If postorder is True, then good_components[v] is the sum of good_components of all children of v plus the number of children of v with remaining_size greater than or equal to x, and remaining_size[v] is the sum of remaining_size of all children of v with remaining_size less than x. If tree.vertices[v].children is empty, good_components[v] and remaining_size[v] remain unchanged.***
