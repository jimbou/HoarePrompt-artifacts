Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the sum of the good components of the children of vertex `s` in the tree, plus one if the remaining size of any child is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the sum of the good components of its children. The second value is the sum of the remaining sizes of the children of vertex `s` if the remaining size of any child is less than `x`.**
