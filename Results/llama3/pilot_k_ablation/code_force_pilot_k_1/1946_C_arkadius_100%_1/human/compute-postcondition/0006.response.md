Output: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k` < `n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `n-1` additional edges between nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are integers, and the internal state of `tree` has been modified by the `root_tree_non_recursive` method, and the result of the function `func_4` called with arguments `tree`, `n`, and `k` is being printed**
