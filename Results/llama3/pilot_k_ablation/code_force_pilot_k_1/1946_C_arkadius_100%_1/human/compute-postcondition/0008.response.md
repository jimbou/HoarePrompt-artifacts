Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, such that 0 <= `k` < `n`. `beg` is equal to `end`, which is the smallest value of `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True. If no such `mid` exists, `beg` is equal to `end`, which is the initial value of `end` (i.e., `n`).**
