Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, such that 0 <= `k` < `n`. `beg` is the smallest value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns True, `end` is `beg - 1`. If no such `beg` exists, `beg` is `n` and `end` is `n-1`.**
