Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root of the tree, `x` is a positive integer, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is the root of the tree `s`, `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, and the remaining size of `v` is the sum of the remaining size of `u` and the previous remaining size of `v`.***
