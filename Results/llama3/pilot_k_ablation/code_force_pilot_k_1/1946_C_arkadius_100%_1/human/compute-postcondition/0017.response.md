Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root of the tree, `x` is a positive integer, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is the root of the tree `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components` of all children of `v` plus the number of children of `v` with `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size` of all children of `v` with `remaining_size` less than `x`. If `tree.vertices[v].children` is empty, `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` remain unchanged.**
