This function performs a binary search to find the smallest value of `mid` for which the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True. If such a value exists, it returns this value; otherwise, it returns the total number of vertices `n` in the tree data structure. The function takes a tree data structure `tree`, the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges to be removed `k` as input, and returns an integer value representing the smallest valid `mid` value or the total number of vertices if no valid `mid` value is found.
