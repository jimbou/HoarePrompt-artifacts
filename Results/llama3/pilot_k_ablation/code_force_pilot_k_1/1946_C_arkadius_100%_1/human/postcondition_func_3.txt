This function performs a binary search to find the smallest value 'beg' for which a given condition 'func_3(tree, n, k, beg)' returns True, where 'tree' is a valid tree data structure with 'n' vertices and 'k' is the number of edges to be removed. If such a 'beg' exists, it returns the smallest value; otherwise, it returns 'n'. The function takes a tree, the number of vertices 'n', and the number of edges to be removed 'k' as input and returns the smallest valid 'beg' value or 'n' if no such value exists.
