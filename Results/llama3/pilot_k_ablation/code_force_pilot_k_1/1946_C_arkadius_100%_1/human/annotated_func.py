#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of good components and the remaining size of a subtree rooted at a given vertex `s` in a tree data structure, based on a threshold value `x`.

The function takes a tree, the number of vertices, the number of edges to be removed, and the minimum size of each connected component as input. It returns True if the number of good components (connected components with size at least x) is greater than the number of edges to be removed, or if the number of good components is equal to the number of edges to be removed and the remaining size is greater than or equal to the minimum size.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search to find the smallest value of `mid` for which the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True. If such a value exists, it returns this value; otherwise, it returns the total number of vertices `n` in the tree data structure. The function takes a tree data structure `tree`, the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges to be removed `k` as input, and returns an integer value representing the smallest valid `mid` value or the total number of vertices if no valid `mid` value is found.
