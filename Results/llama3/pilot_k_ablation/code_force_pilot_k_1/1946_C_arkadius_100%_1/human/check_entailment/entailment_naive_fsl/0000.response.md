Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search in function func_4. The binary search is used to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. However, the program does not correctly update the end variable in the binary search loop. The end variable should be updated to mid - 1 when func_3 returns False, but the program updates it to mid - 1 regardless of the return value of func_3. This can lead to incorrect results when the maximum x is not found in the first iteration of the binary search.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when k is 0. In this case, the program should return n, because no edges need to be removed and the size of each connected component is already at least n. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
