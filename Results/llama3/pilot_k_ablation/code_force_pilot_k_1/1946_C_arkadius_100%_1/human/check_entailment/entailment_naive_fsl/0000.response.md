Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program defines several functions to perform the necessary operations:

1. `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges. These functions seem to be correctly implemented.

2. `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function also appears to be correct.

3. `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum number x that satisfies the condition. This function is also correctly implemented.

4. `func_5` is the main function that reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum number x.

After carefully reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, and the binary search approach is efficient and correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
