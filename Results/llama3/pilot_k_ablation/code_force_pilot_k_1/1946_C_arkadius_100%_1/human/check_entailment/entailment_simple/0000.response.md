Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and uses a recursive function to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree for a given x. The program also correctly handles the base cases and returns the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
