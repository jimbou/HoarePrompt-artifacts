Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where we need to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing two pointers, beg and end, to 1 and n respectively, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. It then enters a loop where it calculates the mid value and checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid. If it is possible, it updates the beg pointer to mid, otherwise it updates the end pointer to mid - 1.

The program uses a helper function, func_3, to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function uses another helper function, func_1, to calculate the number of good components (connected components with size at least x) and the total size of the remaining connected components with size less than x.

The program also uses a Tree class to represent the tree and a TreeNode class to represent each node in the tree. The Tree class has methods to add edges to the tree and to root the tree, and the TreeNode class has attributes to store the edges, children, subtree size, and parent of each node.

The program reads the input from the standard input, which consists of the number of test cases, and for each test case, the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, followed by the edges of the tree.

The program prints the result of each test case, which is the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Correctness: **True**
