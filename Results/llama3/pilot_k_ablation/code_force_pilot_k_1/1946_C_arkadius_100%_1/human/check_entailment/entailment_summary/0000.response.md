Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program constructs a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges using the Tree class and the add_edge method. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the input is a tree with n vertices.

2. The program roots the tree using the root_tree_non_recursive method. This is necessary to establish the parent-child relationships between nodes, which is required for the subsequent calculations.

3. The program defines four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. These functions are used to calculate the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

4. Func_1 calculates the sum of good components and the remaining size of a subtree rooted at a given vertex s in a tree data structure, based on a threshold value x. This function is used by func_3 to determine whether a tree can be split into connected components of a minimum size by removing a specified number of edges.

5. Func_2 is a recursive function that calculates the number of good components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree, where a good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size x. This function is not actually used in the program, but it is provided as an alternative implementation of func_1.

6. Func_3 determines whether a tree can be split into connected components of a minimum size by removing a specified number of edges. This function takes a tree, the number of vertices, the number of edges to be removed, and the minimum size of each connected component as input, and returns True if the number of good components is greater than the number of edges to be removed, or if the number of good components is equal to the number of edges to be removed and the remaining size is greater than or equal to the minimum size.

7. Func_4 performs a binary search to find the smallest value of mid for which func_3 returns True. This function takes a tree data structure, the number of vertices, and the number of edges to be removed as input, and returns an integer value representing the smallest valid mid value.

8. Finally, func_5 constructs a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, roots the tree, and then calls func_4 with the tree, n, and k as arguments, printing the return value. This is the main function that solves the problem.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality to solve the problem, and the execution summaries of its functions are consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
