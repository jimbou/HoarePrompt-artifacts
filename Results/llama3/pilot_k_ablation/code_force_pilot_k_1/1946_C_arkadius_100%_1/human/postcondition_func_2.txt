Determines whether a tree can be decomposed into connected components of a minimum size by removing a specified number of edges. The function takes a Tree object, the number of vertices, the number of edges to be removed, and the minimum size of each connected component as input. It returns True if the number of good components (connected components with size at least x) is greater than the number of edges to be removed, or if the number of good components is equal to the number of edges to be removed and the total size of the remaining connected components is greater than or equal to the minimum size. Otherwise, it returns False.
