This function calculates and returns the sum of good components and the remaining size of a subtree rooted at a given vertex `s` in a tree data structure, based on a threshold value `x`. The function traverses the tree, identifying good components (subtrees with a size greater than or equal to `x`) and calculates the remaining size of each subtree. The function returns a tuple containing the total number of good components and the total remaining size of the subtree rooted at `s`.
