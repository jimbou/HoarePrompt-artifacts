Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program prints:

4 4
4 3
1 1
1 2

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of H. A correct arrangement for n = 4 would be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

This arrangement has a larger size of H.

The program's logic is incorrect, and it does not handle all cases properly. It only works for a few specific cases, but it does not provide a general solution for all possible values of n.
