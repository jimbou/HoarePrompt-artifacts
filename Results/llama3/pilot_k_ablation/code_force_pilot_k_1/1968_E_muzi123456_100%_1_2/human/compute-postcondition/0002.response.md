The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, and the second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`.

Since `t` is a positive integer, decrementing it by 1 will result in a non-negative integer. The value of `t` becomes `t - 1`.

The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains one input: `t` integers, where each integer is between 2 and 10^3, the value of `n` becomes one of these integers.

After executing the entire code block, the final state is:

Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin is empty**
