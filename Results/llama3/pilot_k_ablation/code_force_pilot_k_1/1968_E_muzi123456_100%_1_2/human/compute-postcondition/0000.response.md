Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: t integers (n), where each n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now a positive integer, which was previously unknown. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a sequence of `t` integers (n), each of which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). The value of `t` is now fixed, but the exact values of the `t` integers (n) are still unknown.
