According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, but it is not equal to 3, and `n - 1` is printed, so `n` must be greater than 3. Also, `i` is not defined before the loop, but it is defined in the loop head, so it must be adjusted to be 1.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
