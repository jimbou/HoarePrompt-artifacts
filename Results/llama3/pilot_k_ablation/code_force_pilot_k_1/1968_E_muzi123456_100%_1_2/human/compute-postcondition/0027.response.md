Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) specifies the number of subsequent integers (n) to process. For each n, it prints a sequence of numbers: first n, then n, then n, then n-1, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to n-1 (inclusive) where each number is printed twice, except when n is 3, in which case it prints 2 and 1. After processing all integers, the function leaves the standard input empty and the variable t set to 0.**
