To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `results`, and `stdin`) are not relevant to the loop's execution.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
