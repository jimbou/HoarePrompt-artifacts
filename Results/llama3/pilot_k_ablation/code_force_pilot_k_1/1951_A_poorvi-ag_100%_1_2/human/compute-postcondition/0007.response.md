Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer, larger than 0 and the current value of `count_ones` is odd, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `count_ones` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `results` now contains the string 'no'. The stdin still contains -1 inputs.
