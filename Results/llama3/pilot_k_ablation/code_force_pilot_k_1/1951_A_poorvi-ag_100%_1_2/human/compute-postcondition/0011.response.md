Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string that contains the substring '11', `count_ones` is an integer and is equal to 2, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

In this output state, the code has appended the string 'no' to the `results` list, which was initially empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `start` and `end` variables are still integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is still at least 1, `n` is still an integer, `arr` is still a string containing the substring '11', and `count_ones` is still equal to 2. The stdin still contains -1 inputs.
