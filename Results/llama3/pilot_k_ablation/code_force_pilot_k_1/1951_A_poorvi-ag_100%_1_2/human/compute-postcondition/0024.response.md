Output State: **start and end are integers such that start is less than or equal to end, t is a non-negative integer, results is a list of strings, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no', stdin contains -t inputs. If t is 0, results is an empty list. If t is greater than 0, results contains t strings, each of which is 'yes' if the corresponding input string has an even number of '1's and no consecutive '1's, or if the number of '1's is a multiple of 4, and 'no' otherwise. All strings in the results list have been printed.**
