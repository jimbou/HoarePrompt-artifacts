Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer and is larger than 0 and is not equal to 2, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `count_ones` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `results` now contains the string 'yes', which was appended to it by the executed code. The stdin still contains -1 inputs, indicating that there are no changes to the input state.
