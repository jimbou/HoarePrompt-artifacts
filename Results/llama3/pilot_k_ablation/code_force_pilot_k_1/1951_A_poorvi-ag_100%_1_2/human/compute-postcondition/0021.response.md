According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 string the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer, `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and `stdin` contains `-t` inputs. So for the loop to be executed  the list `results` must have at least 1 string and `r` is the first string in the list.
State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is a non-negative integer, `results` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `r` is the first string in the list, `stdin` contains `-t` inputs**
