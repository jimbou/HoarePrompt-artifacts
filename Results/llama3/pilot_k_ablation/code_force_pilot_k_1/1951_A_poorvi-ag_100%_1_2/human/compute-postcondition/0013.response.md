Output State: **start and end are integers such that start is less than or equal to end, t is at least 1, results is a list containing the string 'yes', n is an integer, arr is a string, count_ones is an integer and is equal to 2, stdin contains -1 inputs, and '11' is not in arr**

The code appends the string 'yes' to the results list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The results list now contains one element, which is the string 'yes'. The other variables retain their initial values and properties.
