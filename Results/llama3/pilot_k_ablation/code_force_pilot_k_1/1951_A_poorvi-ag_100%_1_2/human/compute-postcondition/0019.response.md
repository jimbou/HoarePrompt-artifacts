Postcondition: ***start and end are integers such that start is less than or equal to end, t is at least 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains -1 inputs. If count_ones is 0, results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If count_ones is larger than 0, results is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no'. If count_ones is odd, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If count_ones is even, results is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no'. If count_ones is 2, then if '11' is in arr, results contains 'no', otherwise results contains 'yes'. If count_ones is not 2, then results contains 'yes'.***
