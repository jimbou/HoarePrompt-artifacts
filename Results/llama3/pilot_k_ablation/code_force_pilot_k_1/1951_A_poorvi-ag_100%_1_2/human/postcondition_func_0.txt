This function reads a non-negative integer t from standard input, followed by t strings. For each string, it checks if the number of '1's is even and there are no consecutive '1's, or if the number of '1's is a multiple of 4. If either condition is met, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. Finally, it prints all the strings in the results list.
