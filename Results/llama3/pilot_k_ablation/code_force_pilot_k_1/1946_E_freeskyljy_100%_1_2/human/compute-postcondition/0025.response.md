To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `i < N`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `N`. Given the states right before the loop:

- `N` is a positive integer equal to the first input integer,
- `M1` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer,
- `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1,
- `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input,
- `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input,
- `MOD` is a positive integer,
- `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`,
- `cur` is 1,
- `i` is `R[0] + 1`.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `i` is less than `N`. Since `i` is `R[0] + 1`, we need to ensure that `R[0] + 1` is less than `N`. Given that `R[0]` is a positive integer and part of the list `R` which is derived from the third input, and `N` is a positive integer from the first input, we need to adjust the state so that `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[0] + 1`, `M1` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input, `MOD` is a positive integer, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`**
