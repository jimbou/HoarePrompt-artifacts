Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, and M2 are updated to the input integers. The list L is populated with M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, and the list R is populated with M2 distinct positive integers from the third input. The value of MOD remains unchanged. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been consumed.
