Postcondition: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**
