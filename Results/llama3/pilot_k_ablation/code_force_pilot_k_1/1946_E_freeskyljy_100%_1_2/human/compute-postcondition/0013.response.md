To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` in the loop head. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than 1.

Right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. For `i` to be greater than 1, `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1 and L[-1] must be greater than 2**
