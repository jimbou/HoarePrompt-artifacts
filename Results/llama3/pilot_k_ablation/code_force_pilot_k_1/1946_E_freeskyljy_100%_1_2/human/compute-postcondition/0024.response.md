Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1. If M1 is 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If M1 is greater than 1, then the current value of ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `cur` and `i`. The first line assigns the value 1 to `cur`, and the second line assigns the value `R[0] + 1` to `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `M1` is 1, the state of the variables remains the same. If `M1` is greater than 1, the value of `ans` is still a value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by the product of all numbers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2.
