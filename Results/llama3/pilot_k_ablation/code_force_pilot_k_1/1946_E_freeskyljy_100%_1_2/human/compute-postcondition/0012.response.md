Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to `nums_left` and the value of `L[-1] - 1` to `i`. Since `L[-1]` is the last element of `L`, which is equal to the first element of `R` and also equal to `N`, `nums_left` becomes `N - 2` and `i` becomes `N - 1`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
