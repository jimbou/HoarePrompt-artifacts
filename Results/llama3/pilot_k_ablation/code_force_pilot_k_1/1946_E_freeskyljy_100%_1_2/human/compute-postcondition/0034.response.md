Output State: **The program returns the value of ans, which is either the product of all numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, each multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 2, then multiplied by the value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) and then taken modulo MOD, or the value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 2, depending on the values of M1 and M2.**
