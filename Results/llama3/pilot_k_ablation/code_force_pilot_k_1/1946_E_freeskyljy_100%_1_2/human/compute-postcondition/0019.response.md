Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 3 if i equals L[cur], otherwise cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and the current value of i is equal to L[-1] - 2, which is also equal to L[cur + 1] if i equals L[cur], otherwise i is not equal to L[cur].**

In this output state, the value of `nums_left` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
