Output State: **`N` is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input, `MOD` is a positive integer, `ans` is the value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, `L[-1]` must be greater than 2, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `L[-1] - 2`) and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
