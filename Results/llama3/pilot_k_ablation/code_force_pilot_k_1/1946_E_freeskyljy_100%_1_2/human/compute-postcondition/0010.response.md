Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is equal to N. Either M1 is 1, or M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value returned by the function `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` to the variable `ans`. The second line assigns the value of `M1 - 2` to the variable `cur`. 

The first line affects the variable `ans`, which is assigned a new value. The value of `ans` is now the result of the function `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. 

The second line affects the variable `cur`, which is assigned a new value. The value of `cur` is now `M1 - 2`.

The initial state conditions that remain valid after the code execution are: `N` is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, `M1` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input, `MOD` is a positive integer, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the last element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.
