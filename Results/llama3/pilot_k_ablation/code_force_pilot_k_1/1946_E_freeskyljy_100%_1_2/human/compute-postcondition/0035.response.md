Functionality: **This function calculates a value based on the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R, and returns either 0 or a product of certain numbers modulo MOD. The function first checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if not, returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is equal to N, and if not, returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value by calling a function func_1 with parameters N-1 and L[-1]-1, and then multiplies this value by the product of certain numbers from L[-1]-2 down to 2, and from N-R[0]-1 down to 1, depending on the values of M1 and M2, and returns the result modulo MOD.**
