Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer. If M2 is greater than 1, then nums_left is 0, i is N, cur is M2, and ans is the product of all numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1, each multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 2, then multiplied by the value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) and then taken modulo MOD. If M1 is 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is 1, then ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 2, cur is -1, and i is 1.***
