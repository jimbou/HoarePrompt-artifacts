The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `i` is equal to `R[cur]`. Since `cur` was equal to 1, it is now equal to 2. Therefore, the current value of `i` is now equal to `R[2]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[0] + 1`, `M1` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input, `MOD` is a positive integer, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is 2, and the current value of `i` is equal to `R[2]`.**
