Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If M1 is greater than 1, then ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 2, cur is -1, and i is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and MOD remain unchanged. The value of nums_left is updated to be N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is 1, the state of the variables remains the same. If M1 is greater than 1, the values of ans, cur, and i are also updated as previously described.
