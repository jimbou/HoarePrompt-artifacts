Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, i is R[0] + 2. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 and i is equal to R[2]. Otherwise, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and ans is ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `nums_left` and `i`. The first line decrements `nums_left` by 1, making it `N - R[0] - 2`. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it `R[0] + 2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition `If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 and i is equal to R[2]. Otherwise, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and ans is ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD` still holds true, but now `i` is `R[0] + 2`, so the condition is updated accordingly.
