Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 and i is equal to R[2]. Otherwise, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and ans is ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD.***
