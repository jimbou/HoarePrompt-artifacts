Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the first input integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the second input integer, M2 is a positive integer equal to the third input integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers from the second input, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers from the third input, MOD is a positive integer, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and the current value of i is equal to L[-1] - 1, which is also equal to L[cur + 1]. Additionally, L[-1] is greater than 2.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `cur` being equal to `M1 - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `i` and `L[cur]` is no longer valid, but `i` is still equal to `L[-1] - 1`, which is also equal to `L[cur + 1]`.
