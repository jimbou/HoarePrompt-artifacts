Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[0] + 1`, `M1` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `M2` is a positive integer equal to the third input integer and is greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers from the second input, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers from the third input, `MOD` is a positive integer, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is `ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `N - R[0] - 1`) and taking the modulus `MOD`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
