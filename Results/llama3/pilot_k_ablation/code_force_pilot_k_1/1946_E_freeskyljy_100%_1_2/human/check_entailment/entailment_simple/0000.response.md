Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program uses the mathematical concept of factorials and modular arithmetic to efficiently calculate the result. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the last element of the prefix maximums is not equal to the first element of the suffix maximums, or where the first element of the prefix maximums is not 1, or where the last element of the suffix maximums is not equal to N. The program also correctly handles the case where M1 is 1 or M2 is 1.

Correctness: **True**
