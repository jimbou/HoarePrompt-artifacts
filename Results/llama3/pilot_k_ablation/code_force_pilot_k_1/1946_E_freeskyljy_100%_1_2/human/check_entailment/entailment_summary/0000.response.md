Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, which is used in the calculation of the number of permutations.

func_2 is the main function that takes input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R, and returns the number of permutations that could have been guessed. It first checks for some invalid conditions and returns 0 if any of them are met. Then, it calculates the number of permutations by calling func_1 and multiplying the result by the product of certain numbers from L[-1]-2 down to 2, and from N-R[0]-1 down to 1, depending on the values of M1 and M2.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of permutations based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and invalid conditions correctly, and the calculations are performed modulo MOD to avoid overflow.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
