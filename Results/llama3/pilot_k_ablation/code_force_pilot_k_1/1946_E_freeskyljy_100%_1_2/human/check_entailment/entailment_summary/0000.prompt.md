Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n1, n2):
    if n1 == n2:
        return 1
    if n2 == 0:
        return 1

 Output hints for function1:  Calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, where n1 and n2 are non-negative integers and n2 <= n1. If n1 equals n2 or n2 equals 0, returns 1. Otherwise, returns the product of the factorial of n1 modulo MOD and the modular multiplicative inverse of the product of the factorial of n2 modulo MOD and the factorial of the difference between n1 and n2 modulo MOD.
Function number 2 :

 Output hints for function2:  This function calculates a value based on the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R, and returns either 0 or a product of certain numbers modulo MOD. The function first checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if not, returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is equal to N, and if not, returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value by calling a function func_1 with parameters N-1 and L[-1]-1, and then multiplies this value by the product of certain numbers from L[-1]-2 down to 2, and from N-R[0]-1 down to 1, depending on the values of M1 and M2, and returns the result modulo MOD.
