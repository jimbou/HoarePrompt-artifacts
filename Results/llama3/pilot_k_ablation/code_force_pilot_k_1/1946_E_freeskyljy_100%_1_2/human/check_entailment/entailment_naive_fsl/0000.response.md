Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the result. `func_1` calculates the number of permutations of a given length `n1` with `n2` fixed points, and `func_2` uses this function to calculate the result for the given input.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the length of the permutation is 1, or when the number of prefix maximums or suffix maximums is 0. It also correctly checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is equal to the length of the permutation.

The program also correctly calculates the result using the formula `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, where `N` is the length of the permutation, `L` is the list of prefix maximums, and `R` is the list of suffix maximums.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
