Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The program first checks for the validity of the input and returns 0 if the input is invalid. Then, it calculates the number of permutations by calling the function func_1 and multiplying the result by the product of certain numbers. The program correctly handles the cases where M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or both M1 and M2 are greater than 1. The program also correctly calculates the modular multiplicative inverse and the binomial coefficient modulo MOD.

Correctness: **True**
