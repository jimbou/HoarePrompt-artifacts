Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for multiple test cases. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates through each test case, reading two integers x and y. It then uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the minimum and maximum values and prints them in the correct order.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If a < b, it prints a and b.
- If a == b, it prints a and b (since they are equal, the order doesn't matter).
- If a > b, it prints b and a.

The program also correctly iterates through all test cases, reading the input and printing the output for each case.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
