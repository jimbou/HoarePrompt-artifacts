Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two given integers, x and y, for multiple test cases. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates through each test case, reading two integers (a and b) and printing the minimum followed by the maximum.

The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the integers. If a is less than b, it prints a followed by b. If a is equal to b, it prints a followed by b (since they are the same). If a is greater than b, it prints b followed by a.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing each pair of integers with the smaller integer first, followed by the larger integer.

Correctness: **True**
