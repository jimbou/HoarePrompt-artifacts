Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two given integers. The program reads a series of integer pairs from standard input, sorts each pair in ascending order, and prints the sorted pairs.

The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to compare the two integers and print them in the correct order. If a is less than b, it prints a followed by b. If a is equal to b, it prints a followed by b (since they are the same). If a is greater than b, it prints b followed by a.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads integer pairs, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the sorted pairs.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
