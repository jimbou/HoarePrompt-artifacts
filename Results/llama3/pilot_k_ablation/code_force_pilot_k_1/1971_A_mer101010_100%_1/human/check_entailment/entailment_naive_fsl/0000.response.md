Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes two integers x and y as input. It then prints the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when x is less than y, when x is equal to y, and when x is greater than y. The program also handles the edge cases where x and y are 0. The program's logic is sound and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
