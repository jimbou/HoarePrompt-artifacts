Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. It takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes two integers as input and prints the minimum followed by the maximum. The program handles all possible cases, including when x is less than y, when x is equal to y, and when x is greater than y. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
