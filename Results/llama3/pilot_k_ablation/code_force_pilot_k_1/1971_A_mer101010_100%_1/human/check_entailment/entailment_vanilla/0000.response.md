Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y, and output them in that order.

2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.

3. It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input.

4. The program uses an if-elif-else statement to determine the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b` (since both are the same). If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.

5. The program does not handle any invalid inputs, but since the problem description guarantees that the inputs will be valid (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), this is not a concern.

6. The program does not use any unnecessary variables or operations, and it directly addresses the problem requirements.

7. The program's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, making it easy to verify its correctness.

8. The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
