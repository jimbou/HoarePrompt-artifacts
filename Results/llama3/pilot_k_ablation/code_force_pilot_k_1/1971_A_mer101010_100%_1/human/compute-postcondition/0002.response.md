Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to t (1 <= n <= 100), t is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-1` lines because one line has been read and split into two integers `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are between 0 and 9, as specified in the initial state. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
