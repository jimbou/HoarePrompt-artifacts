Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` and `b` are printed where `a` is less than `b`. If `a` equals `b`, then `a` and `b` which are equal are printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, then "b, a" is printed. stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).***
