The code prints the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9, where `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not equal to `b`. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the precondition, we know that `b` will be printed first, followed by `a`.

Output: **b (an integer between 0 and 9), a (an integer between 0 and 9, where a is not less than b and a is not equal to b)**
