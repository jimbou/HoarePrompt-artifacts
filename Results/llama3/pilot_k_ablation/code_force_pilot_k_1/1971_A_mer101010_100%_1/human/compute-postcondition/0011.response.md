The code prints the values of `b` and `a`. Based on the precondition, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, where `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not equal to `b`. This means that `a` is greater than `b`.

Output: **b (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), a (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, where a is greater than b)**
