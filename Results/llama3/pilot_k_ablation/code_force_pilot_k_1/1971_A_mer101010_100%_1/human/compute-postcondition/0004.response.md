The code prints the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. Specifically, `a` is an integer whose current value is lower than `b`.

Output: **a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and its current value is lower than b), b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
