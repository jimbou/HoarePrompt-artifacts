Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to t (1 <= n <= 100), t is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a` is not less than `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then "b, a" is printed where `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9.**
