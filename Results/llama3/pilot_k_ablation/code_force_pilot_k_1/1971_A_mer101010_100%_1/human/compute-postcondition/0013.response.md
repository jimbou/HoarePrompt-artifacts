Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `a` is not less than `b`. If `a` equals `b`, then `a` and `b` which are equal and are between 0 and 9 inclusive are printed. Otherwise, "b, a" is printed where `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.***
