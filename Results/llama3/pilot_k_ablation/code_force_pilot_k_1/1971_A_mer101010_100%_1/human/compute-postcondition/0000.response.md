The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `n` becomes equal to t. The second line assigns the value 0 to `t`. 

Output State: **n is an integer equal to t (1 <= n <= 100), t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
