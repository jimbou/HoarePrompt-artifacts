The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the loop execute, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, because the loop starts from 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains n lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
