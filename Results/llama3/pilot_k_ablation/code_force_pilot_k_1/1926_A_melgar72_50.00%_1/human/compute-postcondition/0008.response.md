Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 0, `countB` is 0, `list(userString)` is a list of characters in `userString`, `letter` is the first character in `userString`, `letter` is not 'A', and `letter` is not 'B', and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `userString`, `countA`, `countB`, and `list(userString)` remain unchanged. The value of `letter` is still the first character in `userString`, which is neither 'A' nor 'B'. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that it skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration, moving on to the next iteration.
