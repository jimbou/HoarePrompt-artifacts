Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters in `userString`, and the first character in `userString`, `letter`, is either 'A' or 'B'. If the first character in `userString` is 'A', then `countA` is 1 and `countB` is 0. If the first character in `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is 1. If the first character in `userString` is neither 'A' nor 'B', then we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.***
