Postcondition: **The string `userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B. If the first character in the string is 'B', then `countB` is incremented by 1. If the first character is not 'B', the values of `countA` and `countB` remain unchanged, and the rest of the code in the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration.**
