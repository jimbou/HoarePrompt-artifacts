Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters in `userString`, `letter` is the first character in `userString` and `letter` is not 'A'. If the first character in `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is 1. If the first character in `userString` is not 'B', then we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.***
