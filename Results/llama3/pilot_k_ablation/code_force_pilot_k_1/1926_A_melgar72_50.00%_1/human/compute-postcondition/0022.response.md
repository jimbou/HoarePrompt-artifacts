Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is the number of 'A's in `userString`, `countB` is the number of 'B's in `userString`, `list(userString)` is a list of characters in `userString`. If `countA` is greater than `countB`, then 'A' is printed. If `countB` is greater than `countA`, then 'B' is printed. If `countA` is equal to `countB`, then no action is taken.***
