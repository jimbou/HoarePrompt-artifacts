Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The program uses a list `a` to store the size of the array after each operation and a dictionary `b` to store the value of the elements in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then initializes the list `a` with a single element 0 and an empty dictionary `b`.

3. The program then reads each operation and updates the list `a` and dictionary `b` accordingly. If the operation is of type 1, it increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the value in `b`. If the operation is of type 2, it appends a new element to `a` which is the product of the last element and the given number plus 1.

4. After reading all operations, the program reverses the list `a` and reads the queries.

5. For each query, the program calls the function `func_1` to find the k-th element of the array. The function `func_1` takes a query as input, converts it to an integer, and checks if it is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, the function returns the corresponding value. If not, the function iterates over the list `a` in reverse order, updates the query using the modulo operator, and checks if the updated query is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, the function returns the corresponding value.

6. Finally, the program prints the results of all queries for each test case.

The program seems to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
