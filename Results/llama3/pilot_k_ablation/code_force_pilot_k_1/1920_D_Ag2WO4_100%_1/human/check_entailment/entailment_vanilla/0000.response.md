Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by initializing an empty list `a` and an empty dictionary `b`. The list `a` will store the sizes of the array after each operation, and the dictionary `b` will store the values appended to the array.

2. The program then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d` for each test case.

3. The program iterates over each operation. If the operation is of type 1 (appending an integer), it increments the size of the array and stores the appended value in the dictionary `b`. If the operation is of type 2 (appending copies of the array), it calculates the new size of the array by multiplying the current size with the number of copies plus one.

4. After all operations are processed, the program reverses the list `a` to get the sizes of the array in reverse order.

5. The program then reads the queries and applies the function `func_1` to each query. The function `func_1` takes a query `x` and finds the corresponding value in the array by repeatedly taking the modulus of `x` with the sizes in the list `a` until it finds a value that is present in the dictionary `b`.

6. Finally, the program prints the results of the queries.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the print statement. The program uses `str(list(map(r, input().split())))[1:-1].replace(',', '')` to print the results, but the function `r` is not defined anywhere in the program. It seems that the function `r` should be replaced with the function `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
