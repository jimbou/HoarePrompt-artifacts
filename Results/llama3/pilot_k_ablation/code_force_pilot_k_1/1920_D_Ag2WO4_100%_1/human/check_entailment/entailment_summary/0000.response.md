Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation and a dictionary `b` to store the values appended to the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then iterates over the operations, updating the size of the array and storing the values appended to the array in the dictionary `b`.

After all operations have been processed, the program reads the queries and uses a function `func_1` to determine the k-th element of the array for each query. The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and checks if it is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the corresponding value. If not, it iterates through the list `a` in reverse order, updating `x` by subtracting 1, taking the modulus of the current element in `a`, and adding 1. If `x` becomes an element of `b` during this process, it returns the corresponding value from `b`.

The program then prints the results of the queries.

Based on the provided execution summary, the function `func_1` correctly determines the k-th element of the array for each query. The program correctly handles the operations and queries, and the output matches the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
