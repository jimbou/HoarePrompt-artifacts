Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array a after a series of operations. The program uses two lists, a and b, to keep track of the size of the array and the elements appended to it, respectively. The function func_1 is used to find the k-th element of the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and queries. It then reads the operations and queries, and for each query, it calls the function func_1 to find the k-th element of the array.

The function func_1 works by first checking if the query k is in list b. If it is, the function returns the corresponding element. If not, the function iterates through list a, updating k by subtracting 1, taking the modulus of the current element in a, and adding 1. This process effectively "wraps around" the array, allowing the function to find the k-th element even if k is larger than the size of the array.

The program then prints the results of the queries for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
