Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly handles the two types of operations: appending an integer to the end of the array and appending x copies of the array to the end of the array.

2. The program correctly calculates the size of the array after each operation and stores it in the list `a`.

3. The program correctly reverses the list `a` to get the sizes of the array in the correct order for the queries.

4. The program correctly handles the queries by finding the corresponding element in the array using the sizes stored in `a` and the dictionary `b`.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the size of the array exceeds 10^19 by skipping the remaining operations.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the query is not in the dictionary `b` by iterating through the sizes in `a` to find the corresponding element.

7. The program correctly prints the answers to the queries.

Correctness: **True**
