Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input contains a query that is larger than the size of the array after all operations. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct element in the array and will return an incorrect result.

For example, if the input is:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will not be able to find the correct element for the query 20, because the size of the array after all operations is 16, which is less than 20.

The program should handle this case by checking if the query is larger than the size of the array and returning an error message or a special value to indicate that the query is out of range.
