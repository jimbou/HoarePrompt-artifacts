Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program handles the queries. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly, and it does not handle the case when the query is not in the dictionary `b`. 

For example, if the input is:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will not work correctly for the query 14, because 14 is not in the dictionary `b`. The program should return the 4th element of the array, but it will not do so.

To fix this issue, the function `func_1` should be modified to handle the case when the query is not in the dictionary `b`. One possible solution is to use a loop to find the correct element in the array. 

Here is a possible correction:

def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if x in b:
        return b[x]
    else:
        for i in a:
            x = (x - 1) % i + 1
            if x in b:
                return b[x]

However, this correction is still not enough, because the program does not handle the case when the query is larger than the size of the array. In this case, the program should return an error message or handle the query in a different way.

Therefore, the program is not correct, and the Correctness is **False**.
