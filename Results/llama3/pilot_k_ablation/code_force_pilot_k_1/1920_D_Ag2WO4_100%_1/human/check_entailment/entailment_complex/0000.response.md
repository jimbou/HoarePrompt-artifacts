Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and queries. It then reads the operations and queries, and for each query, it finds the k-th element of the array a.

The program uses a dictionary b to store the elements of the array a, where the key is the index of the element and the value is the element itself. It also uses a list a to store the sizes of the array after each operation.

The program then iterates through the list a in reverse order, and for each size, it updates the query index x by subtracting 1, taking the modulus of the current size, and adding 1. If x is found in the dictionary b during this iteration, the program returns the corresponding element.

The program correctly handles the case where the array size exceeds 10^18, and it also correctly handles the case where the query index is greater than the array size.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
