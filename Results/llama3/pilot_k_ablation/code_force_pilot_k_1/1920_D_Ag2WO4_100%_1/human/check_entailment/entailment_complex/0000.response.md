Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the values of the elements in the array. The program iterates through the operations, updating the size of the array and storing the values of the elements in the dictionary. Then, it iterates through the queries, using the dictionary to find the value of the element at the given index.

The program uses the modulo operator to handle the case where the index is greater than the size of the array. This is because the array is repeated after each operation of type 2, so the index can be reduced modulo the size of the array to find the corresponding element.

The program also handles the case where the index is not in the dictionary `b` by iterating through the list `a` and updating the index until it is in the dictionary. This is because the dictionary only stores the values of the elements that have been explicitly added to the array, so if the index is not in the dictionary, it must be in one of the repeated sections of the array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
