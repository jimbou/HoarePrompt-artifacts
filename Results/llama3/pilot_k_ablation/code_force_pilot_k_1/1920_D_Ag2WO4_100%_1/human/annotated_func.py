#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a list of integers, where the first two integers are the number of operations and the number of queries, followed by a list of operations, where each operation is a list of two integers, and a list of queries, where each query is an integer.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the element in the list 'b' at the index equal to the number of test cases 'x'.
    #State: x is an integer, which is the number of test cases, stdin contains no input, and x is not in b
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is ((...(((x - 1) % a[0] + 1) - 1) % a[1] + 1)... - 1) % a[n] + 1) where n is the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements, stdin contains no input, and either `x` is not in `b` or the function has returned a value from `b`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer x and two lists a and b as input. It first checks if x is in list b and returns the corresponding element if found. If not, it iterates through list a, updating x by subtracting 1, taking the modulus of the current element in a, and adding 1. If x is found in list b during this iteration, the function returns the corresponding element. If x is not found in b after the iteration, the function returns the final updated value of x.
