Output State: **x is an integer, which is the number of test cases, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of x has been changed from a list of integers to an integer, which is the number of test cases. The rest of the information in the initial state is still valid, but since stdin is now empty, it is not included in the output state.
