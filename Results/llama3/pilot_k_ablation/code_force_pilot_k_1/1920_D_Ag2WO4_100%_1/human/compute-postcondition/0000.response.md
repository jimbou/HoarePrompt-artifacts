Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, followed by a list of operations where each operation is a list of two integers, and finally a list of queries where each query is an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been converted to an integer, but its original structure and the structure of the test cases remain unchanged. The first element of `x` is now an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case still consists of a list of integers with the same structure as before.
