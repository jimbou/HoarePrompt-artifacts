Postcondition: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, followed by a list of operations where each operation is a list of two integers, and finally a list of queries where each query is an integer. The current value of `x` is also an element of the list `b`.**
