Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The program iterates over the array `arr` and for each element, it adds the element plus its index plus one to a set `st`. This ensures that each element in the set is unique, as required by the problem description. After all elements have been processed, the program sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements.

The program correctly handles the case where the same element is inserted multiple times, as the set will only store unique elements. It also correctly handles the case where the array is empty, as the set will also be empty.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
