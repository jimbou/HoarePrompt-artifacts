Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` after performing the specified operations.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It creates an empty set `st` to store the unique elements.
4. It iterates over the array `a` and adds each element `a[i]` plus its index `i` plus 1 to the set `st`. This is equivalent to performing the operation of inserting `a[i] + i` into the set `S` in the problem description.
5. After iterating over the entire array, the set `st` contains the unique elements that can be used to construct the array `b`.
6. The program sorts the set `st` in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.
7. Finally, it prints the sorted set `st` as the lexicographically largest array `b`.

The program correctly implements the problem description and should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
