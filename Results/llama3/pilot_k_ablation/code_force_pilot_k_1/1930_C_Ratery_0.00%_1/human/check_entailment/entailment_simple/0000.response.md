Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
3. It creates an empty set `st` to store unique elements.
4. It iterates over the array `arr` and adds each element `arr[i]` plus its index `i` plus one to the set `st`. This is done to simulate the three-step operation described in the problem.
5. After processing the entire array, it sorts the set `st` in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.
6. Finally, it prints the sorted elements of the set `st` using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem's requirements. The use of a set to store unique elements ensures that duplicates are eliminated, and the sorting step produces the lexicographically largest `b` array.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the line where it adds elements to the set `st`, it uses `arr[i] + i + 1`. According to the problem statement, the correct calculation should be `arr[i] + i`, not `arr[i] + i + 1`. This is because the problem statement specifies that the element `a_i + i` should be inserted into the set, not `a_i + i + 1`.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the off-by-one error in the calculation of the elements added to the set `st`.
