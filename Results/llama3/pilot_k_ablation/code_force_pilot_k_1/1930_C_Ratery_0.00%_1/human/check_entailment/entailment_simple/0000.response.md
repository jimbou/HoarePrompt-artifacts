Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
3. It then creates a set `st` to store unique elements.
4. The program iterates over the array `arr` and adds each element `arr[i]` plus its 1-based index `i + 1` to the set `st`. This is in accordance with the problem statement, which requires adding `a_i + i` to the set `S`.
5. After adding all elements to the set `st`, the program sorts the set in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.
6. Finally, the program prints the sorted set `st` as the lexicographically largest `b` that can be constructed.

The program correctly implements the problem statement and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
