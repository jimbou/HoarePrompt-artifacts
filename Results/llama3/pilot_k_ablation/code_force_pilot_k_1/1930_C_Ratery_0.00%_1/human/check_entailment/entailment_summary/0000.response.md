Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by iterating over the input array, adding each element to its 1-based index, storing the results in a set to ensure uniqueness, and then printing the elements of the set in descending order.

The program uses a set to store the results, which automatically eliminates duplicates. It then sorts the set in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument, which returns a new list containing the elements of the set in descending order. Finally, it prints the elements of the sorted list using the `print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))` statement, which unpacks the list into separate arguments to the `print` function.

The program correctly handles the case where the input array has duplicate elements, as the set will only store unique elements. It also correctly handles the case where the input array has elements that are already in the set, as the set will not store duplicate elements.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the lexicographically largest `b` that Stack can make.

Correctness: **True**
