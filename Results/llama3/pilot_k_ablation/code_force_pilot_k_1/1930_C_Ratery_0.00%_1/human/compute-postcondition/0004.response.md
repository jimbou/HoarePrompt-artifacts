The code prints the elements of the set `st` in descending order.
The set `st` contains elements of the form `arr[i] + i + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, where `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive.
Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `st`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `st` in descending order.
Output: **elements of the form arr[i] + i + 1 for i ranging from 0 to n-1, in descending order (where arr[i] is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive)**
