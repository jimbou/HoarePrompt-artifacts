Based on the precondition, we can determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

The `print` statement is printing the elements of the set `st` in descending order, using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.

The set `st` contains `n` integers between 2 and 10^9 + `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, the maximum value in `st` can be at most 10^9 + 3 * 10^5.

When the `sorted` function is applied to `st` with `reverse=True`, it will return a list of the elements in `st` in descending order. The `*` operator is used to unpack this list into separate arguments to the `print` function.

Therefore, the `print` statement will print the elements of `st` in descending order, separated by spaces.

Since the exact values in `st` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the elements of st in descending order, separated by spaces, where each element is an integer between 2 and 10^9 + n**
