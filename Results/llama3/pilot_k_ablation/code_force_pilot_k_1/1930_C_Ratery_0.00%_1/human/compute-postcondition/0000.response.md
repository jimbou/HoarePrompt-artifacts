Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, st is an empty set**

The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since each test case starts with an integer `n`, this line consumes one test case from stdin, leaving multiple test cases minus one. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, as specified in the initial state.

The second line reads `n` space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to the list `arr`. Since `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` will contain between 1 and 3 * 10^5 integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

The third line initializes an empty set `st`. This line does not affect any other variables or the state of stdin.

Therefore, the final output state is: `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `st` is an empty set.
