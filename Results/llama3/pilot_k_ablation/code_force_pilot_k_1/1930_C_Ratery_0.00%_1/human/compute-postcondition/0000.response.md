Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, st is an empty set, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input for each test case.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which is the length of the array `a`. The array `arr` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, which are the elements of array `a`. The set `st` is empty, as it is initialized with an empty set. Stdin contains multiple test cases, but each test case has 2 lines of input removed, which were used to assign values to `n` and `arr`.
