Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `st` is a set containing one element which is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been updated to include the element `arr[0] + 1`, which is the sum of the first element of the list `arr` and 1. The value of `i` remains 0, and the values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
