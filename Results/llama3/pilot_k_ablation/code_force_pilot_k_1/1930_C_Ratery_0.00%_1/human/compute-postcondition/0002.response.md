The code adds an element to the set `st`. The element is the sum of the value at index `i` in the list `arr`, `i` itself, and 1. Since `i` is 0, the element added to the set is `arr[0] + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `arr[0] + 1`. The value of `arr[0]` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, so the element added to the set is an integer between 2 and 10^9 + 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input for each test case.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing one integer between 2 and 10^9 + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input for each test case.**
