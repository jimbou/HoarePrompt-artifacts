The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, st is an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, st is an empty set, `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 0**
