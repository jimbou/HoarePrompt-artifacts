Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is an integer equal to n, h is an integer equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), _ is 0**

The code reads an integer t from stdin, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. The first line assigns the values of n and k to the variables n and k, respectively. The second line initializes the variable s to 0. The third line initializes the variable i to 0. The fourth line assigns the value of n to the variable d. The fifth line assigns the value of n to the variable h. The sixth line initializes the variable p to 1. The seventh line initializes the variable g to 0. 

The values of n and k are updated to the values read from stdin. The values of s, i, d, h, p, and g are initialized to 0, 0, n, n, 1, and 0, respectively. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
