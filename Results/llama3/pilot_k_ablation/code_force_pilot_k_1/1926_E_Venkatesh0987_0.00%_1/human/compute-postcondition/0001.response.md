Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is equal to n, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code reads an integer t from stdin, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. The first line assigns the values of n and k to the variables n and k, respectively. The subsequent lines initialize several variables: s to 0, i to 0, d to n, h to n, p to 1, and g to 0. The variable _ is already 0 from the initial state. After executing the code, the values of n and k are updated to the last pair of integers read from stdin. The other variables are initialized as specified. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with two integers n and k.
