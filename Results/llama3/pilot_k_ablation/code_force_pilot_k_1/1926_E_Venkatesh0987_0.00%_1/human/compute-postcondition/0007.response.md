Output State: **s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, h is equal to n - (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is equal to (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code block modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the integer division of `h + 1` by 2, which is equivalent to the ceiling of `h / 2`. Since `h` is equal to `n`, `g` becomes `(n + 1) // 2`. The second line decrements `h` by the same value, making `h` equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The third line simply increments `p` by 1, making it 2. The remaining variables and the state of stdin remain unchanged.
