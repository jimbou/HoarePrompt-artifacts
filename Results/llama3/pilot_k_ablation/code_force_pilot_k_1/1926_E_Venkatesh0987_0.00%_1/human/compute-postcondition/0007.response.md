Output State: **s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, h is an integer equal to n - (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), _ is 0**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the integer division of `h + 1` by 2, which is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 2`. The second line decrements `h` by the same value, resulting in `h` becoming `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The third line simply increments `p` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
