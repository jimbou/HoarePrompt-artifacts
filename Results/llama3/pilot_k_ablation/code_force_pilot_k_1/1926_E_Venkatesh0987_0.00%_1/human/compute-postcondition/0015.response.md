Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is an integer equal to n, h is an integer equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), _ is 0. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, h is 0, p is equal to the initial value of i, g is the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (n + 1) // 2, (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2, (n - (n + 1) // 2 - (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2, ... , f is k - g, y is 2, and the value of y which is 2 is being printed. If k <= (n + 1) // 2, then 2 * k - 1 is being printed.***
