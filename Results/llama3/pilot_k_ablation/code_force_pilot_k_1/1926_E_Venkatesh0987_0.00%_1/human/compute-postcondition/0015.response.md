Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 1, h is equal to n - i * ((n + 1) // 2), p is equal to i, g is equal to i * ((n + 1) // 2) - (i * (i - 1)) // 2, _ is 0, f is equal to k - g, y is equal to 2, and the value of y which is 2 is being printed if k > (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is equal to n, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 times k minus 1 is printed, where k is an integer between 1 and n***
