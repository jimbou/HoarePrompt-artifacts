Output State: **s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, h is equal to n - i * ((n + 1) // 2), p is equal to i, g is equal to i * ((n + 1) // 2) - (i * (i - 1)) // 2, _ is 0, f is equal to k - g, y is equal to 2 ** (i - 1) * f, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `d`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables, `f` and `y`, which are calculated based on the existing variables. The value of `f` is the difference between `k` and `g`, and the value of `y` is the result of multiplying `f` by 2 raised to the power of `i-1`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `t-1` lines of input.
