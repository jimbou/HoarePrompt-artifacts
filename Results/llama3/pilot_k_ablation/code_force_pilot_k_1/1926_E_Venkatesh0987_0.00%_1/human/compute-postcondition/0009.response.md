Output State: **s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, h is 0, p is equal to the initial value of i, g is the sum of the first i terms of the sequence (n + 1) // 2, (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2, (n - (n + 1) // 2 - (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2, ... , f is k - g, y is 2 ** (i - 1) * f, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), _ is 0**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value of `k - g` to `f`. Since `k` is an integer and `g` is the sum of the first `i` terms of the sequence, `f` becomes an integer equal to `k - g`. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * f` to `y`. Since `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `f` is an integer, `y` becomes an integer equal to `2 ** (i - 1) * f`. No other variables are affected.
