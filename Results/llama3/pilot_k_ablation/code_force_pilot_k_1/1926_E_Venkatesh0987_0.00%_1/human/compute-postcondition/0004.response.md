Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is (d + 1) // 2, i is 1, d is (d + 1) // 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**

The code block modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by the integer division of `d + 1` by 2. Since `d` is equal to `n`, this effectively adds half of `n` plus one, divided by two, to `s`. The second line subtracts the same value from `d`, effectively making `d` equal to half of `n` plus one, divided by two. The third line simply increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
