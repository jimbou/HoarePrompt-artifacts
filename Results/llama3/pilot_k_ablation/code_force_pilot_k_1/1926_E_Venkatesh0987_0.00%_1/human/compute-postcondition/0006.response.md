To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `p <= i - 1`. The loop will execute if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. Given the states right before the loop, we can see that `p` is 1 and `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to be greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `p` is 1, for the loop to execute, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1. This means `i` must be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it meets this condition.

The adjusted state is:

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^9)**
