To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `s` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `d` is 0
- `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to be greater than or equal to `k`
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` is an integer
- `h` is an integer equal to `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
- `_` is 0

The condition `p <= i - 1` involves only `p` and `i`. For the loop to execute, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Given that `p` is 1, we need `i` to be at least 2 for the condition to be true.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`. It must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `h` is an integer equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `_` is 0**
