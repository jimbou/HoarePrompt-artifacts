The only variables in the loop head are variable  `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), int(input()) must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
