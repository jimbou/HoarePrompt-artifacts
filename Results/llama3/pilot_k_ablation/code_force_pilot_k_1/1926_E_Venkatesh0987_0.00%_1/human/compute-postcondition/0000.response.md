According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input from stdin. If the input from stdin is an integer that is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input from stdin must be an integer that is at least 1 and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `_` is 0**
