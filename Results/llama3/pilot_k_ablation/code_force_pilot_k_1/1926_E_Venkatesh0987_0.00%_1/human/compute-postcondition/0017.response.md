Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints the result of a specific operation based on the values of n and k. If k is greater than half of n, it performs a series of calculations involving divisions and multiplications, and prints the final result. If k is not greater than half of n, it simply prints 2 times k minus 1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables n, k, and other internal variables in an undefined state.**
