Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement. It first checks if the k-th card is among the odd-numbered cards. If it is, it simply prints 2*k - 1. If it's not, it calculates the number of cards that have been laid down in the previous iterations (i.e., the odd-numbered cards, the cards that are twice an odd number, and so on) and subtracts this number from k to find the position of the k-th card in the current iteration. It then prints the k-th card in the current iteration, which is 2^(i-1) times the position of the card in the current iteration.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, and the case where k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. It also correctly handles the case where n is a power of 2, and the case where n is not a power of 2.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
