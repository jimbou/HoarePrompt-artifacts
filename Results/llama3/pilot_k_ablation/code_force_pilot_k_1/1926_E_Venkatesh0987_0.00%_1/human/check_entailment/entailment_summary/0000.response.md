Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th card that Vladislav lays down in a specific process. The process involves laying down cards in a row based on certain rules, and the program aims to find the k-th card in this process.

The program uses a loop to iterate over each test case, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then checks if k is greater than half of n. If it is, the program performs a series of calculations involving divisions and multiplications to determine the output value. If k is less than or equal to half of n, it simply prints 2 times k minus 1.

The program's logic is based on the rules of the problem, which state that Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order. The program correctly implements these rules and calculates the k-th card accordingly.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program reads a series of test cases from standard input, calculates and prints an integer value for each test case, and continues this process until all test cases have been read.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, program, and execution summary, it can be concluded that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
