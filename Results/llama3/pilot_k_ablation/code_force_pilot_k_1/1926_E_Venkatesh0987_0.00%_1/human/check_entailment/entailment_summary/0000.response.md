Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

For each test case, it first checks if k is greater than half of n. If it is, the program enters a loop where it calculates the number of cards laid down in each iteration (s) and the remaining cards (d). It also keeps track of the number of iterations (i) and the total number of cards laid down in previous iterations (g). 

Once the loop finishes, it calculates the position of the k-th card in the current iteration (f) and prints the value of the k-th card, which is 2 raised to the power of (i - 1) multiplied by f.

If k is not greater than half of n, the program simply prints 2 times k minus 1, which is the correct value for the k-th card in this case.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
