Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for all integers from 1 to n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the integer n itself, not the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n.

The program should iterate over all integers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each integer, and add it to the total sum. The provided program only calls the function `func_1` with the argument `i` in the range of 13, which is not related to the input `n`.

Moreover, the program does not handle the input `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the largest number Vladislav writes) as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
