Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given integer n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the integer n itself, not the sum of the numbers on the board.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It then calls this function for integers from 0 to 12 and prints the sum of the results. However, this does not solve the problem as stated.

To solve the problem, the program should iterate over the integers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each integer, and sum up these results.

Correctness: **False**
