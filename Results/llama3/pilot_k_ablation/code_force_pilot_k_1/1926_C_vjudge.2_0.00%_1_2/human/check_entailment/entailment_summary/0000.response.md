Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The program does not read the number of test cases (t) from the input, which is required according to the problem description.

2. The program does not read the input for each test case (n) and does not use it to calculate the sum of the digits.

3. The program only calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12, which is not the required range.

4. The program does not print the sum of the digits for each test case separately.

5. The function func_1 is defined after it is called, which will result in a NameError.

Correctness: **False**
