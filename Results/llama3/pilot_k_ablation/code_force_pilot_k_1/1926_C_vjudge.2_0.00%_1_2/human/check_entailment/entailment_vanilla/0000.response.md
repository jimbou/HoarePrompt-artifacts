Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `n`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each digit `d` in the string representation of `n`, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program is not reading the input from the user. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from the first line, which contains the number of test cases `t`, and then each subsequent line contains a single integer `n`. The program is not reading this input.
2. The program is not iterating over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it is iterating over the range of numbers from 0 to 12 (inclusive) using the `range(13)` function.
3. The program is not calculating the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. Instead, it is simply printing the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the range.

To fix these issues, the program should read the input from the user, iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look:
```python
t = int(input())  # read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())  # read the largest number Vladislav writes
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total_sum += sum(int(d) for d in str(i))
    print(total_sum)
```
Correctness: **False**
