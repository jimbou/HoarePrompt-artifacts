Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 1, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is less than `k`, and the current value of `p` is `n`, and the function `func_2` has been called with the argument `m` which is `(n // k) * max_val`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function `func_2` has been called with the argument `m`, which is the product of `n // k` and `max_val`. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the function call does not affect the state of the program.
