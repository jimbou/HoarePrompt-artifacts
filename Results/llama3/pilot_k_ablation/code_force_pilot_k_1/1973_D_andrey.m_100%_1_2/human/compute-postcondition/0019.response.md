Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is 0, `j` is 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` and is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after `k` iterations. If `func_2(m)` was called, then `p` equals `n` and `m` equals `i * max_val` for some `i` in the range `[n // k, 0]`**
