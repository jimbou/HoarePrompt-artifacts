Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` equals `n` and `m` equals `i * max_val` for some `i` in the range `[n // k, 0]`, and the return value of `func_2(-1)` has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the return value of `func_2(-1)` has been returned. The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `r`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.
