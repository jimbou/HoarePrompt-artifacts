Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer and is at least 1, max_val is the maximum value of i for which func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, or 0 if no such i exists, i is n // k, r is the return value of func_1(1, 1 * n), m is (n // k) * max_val, p is 0, and j is 1.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `r`, `m`, or `j`. The only variable affected is `p`, which is assigned the value 0. The `break` statement does not have any impact on the variables as it is used to exit a loop, but there is no loop in the provided code snippet.
