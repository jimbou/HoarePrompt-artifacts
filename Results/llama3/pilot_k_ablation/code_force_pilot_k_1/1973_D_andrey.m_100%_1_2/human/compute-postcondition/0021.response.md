Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, and performs the following actions:**

*   It finds the maximum value `max_val` of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` is set to 0.
*   It then iterates over the range `[n // k, 0]` in reverse order and for each `i` in this range, it calculates `m = i * max_val`.
*   For each `m`, it iterates `k` times, calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` and updating `p` with the return value. If `p` becomes equal to `n` during these iterations, it calls `func_2(m)` and returns.
*   If no `m` is found for which `p` becomes equal to `n` after `k` iterations, it calls `func_2(-1)`.

In summary, the function searches for a value `m` that satisfies a certain condition involving `func_1` and `k` iterations, and if found, calls `func_2(m)`. If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`.
