Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is the maximum value of i for which func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, or 0 if no such i exists, i is n // k, r is the return value of func_1(1, 1 * n), m is (n // k) * max_val, p is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `m` is assigned the value of `i * max_val`, which is equivalent to `(n // k) * max_val`. The variable `p` is assigned the value of 0.
