Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `_` is 0, and the function `func_3()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The function `func_3()` is executed, but its effects are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine any changes it may have made to the program state. Therefore, we simply note that the function has been executed.
