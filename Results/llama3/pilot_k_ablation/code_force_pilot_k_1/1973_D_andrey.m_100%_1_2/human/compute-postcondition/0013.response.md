Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 1, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is 1, and `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `r`, `m`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `p` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. If this return value is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is set to 0.
