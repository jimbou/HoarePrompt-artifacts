Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and is at least 1, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is `k` if `p` never reached `n` during the loop, otherwise `j` is less than `k`, and `p` is not equal to `n` and is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after `k` iterations***
