Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of `m` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays, where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program also correctly handles the case where no such `m` exists.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. `func_1` is used to query the hidden array and find the smallest positive integer `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`, where `l` and `x` are input parameters. `func_2` is used to print the answer `m` and wait for user input. `func_3` is the main function that takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and performs the binary search to find the maximum value of `m`. `func_4` is used to read the number of test cases `t` from standard input and execute `func_3` `t` times.

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of `m` and correctly handles the case where no such `m` exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
