Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the hidden array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`.

3. It then tries to find the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, n) = max_val * n`. This is done by iterating over all possible values of `max_val` from `n` to `1` and checking if there exists a subarray that satisfies the condition.

4. Once `max_val` is found, it tries to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with a product of length and maximum equal to `m`. This is done by iterating over all possible values of `m` from `n // k * max_val` to `1` and checking if the array can be split into `k` subarrays that satisfy the condition.

5. If such an `m` is found, it outputs `m` and returns. If no such `m` is found, it outputs `-1` and returns.

The program uses two helper functions: `func_1` to make queries about the array and `func_2` to output the answer.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to solve the problem correctly. However, there are a few potential issues:

* The program assumes that the input is valid and does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input array is not a list of integers, the program will fail.
* The program uses a brute-force approach to find `max_val` and `m`, which may not be efficient for large inputs.
* The program does not handle the case where `k` is `1` separately, which may lead to unnecessary computations.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, but it may not be efficient or robust.

Correctness: **True**
