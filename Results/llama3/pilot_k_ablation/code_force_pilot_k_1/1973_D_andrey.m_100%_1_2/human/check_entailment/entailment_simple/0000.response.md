Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that the array can be split into exactly k subarrays, where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum equal to m.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of m. It first finds the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n. This is done to ensure that the product of the length and maximum of each subarray does not exceed n.

Then, it iterates over the range [n // k, 0, -1] to find the largest value of i such that i * max_val can be the product of the length and maximum of each subarray. For each i, it checks if the array can be split into exactly k subarrays with a product of i * max_val. If it can, it calls func_2(m) to print the answer and returns.

If no such i is found, it calls func_2(-1) to print -1 as the answer.

The program also correctly handles the input and output operations, including printing the queries and answers, and flushing the output buffer.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
