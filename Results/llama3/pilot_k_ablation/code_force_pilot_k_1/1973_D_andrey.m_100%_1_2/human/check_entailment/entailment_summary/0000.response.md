Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that a hidden array of length `n` can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, with each subarray having a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m`.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. `func_1` is used to query the hidden array, `func_2` is used to print the answer, `func_3` is the main function that performs the binary search, and `func_4` is the entry point of the program that reads the number of test cases and executes `func_3` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description accurately. It uses the query function `func_1` to find the maximum value `m` and then uses `func_2` to print the answer. The binary search approach used in `func_3` is efficient and correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In the `func_3` function, the program assumes that the maximum value `m` is always greater than 0. But in the problem description, it is mentioned that if no such `m` exists, the program should print -1. Therefore, the program should handle the case where `m` is 0 or less.

Correctness: **False**
