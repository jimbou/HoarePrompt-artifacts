Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the maximum value in the array is not unique. In this case, the program will incorrectly assume that the maximum value is unique and will not consider other possible maximum values.

For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3] and k is 3, the program will incorrectly assume that the maximum value is 3 and will not consider the possibility that the maximum value is 2. As a result, the program will not find the correct solution.

In the given code, the function func_3() does not handle this case correctly. It assumes that the maximum value is unique and does not consider other possible maximum values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
