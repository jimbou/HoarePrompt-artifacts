Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0, the current value of `i` is the first element in the list `num` and either `i` is less than `start` or `i` is greater than `end`, stdin is empty.***
