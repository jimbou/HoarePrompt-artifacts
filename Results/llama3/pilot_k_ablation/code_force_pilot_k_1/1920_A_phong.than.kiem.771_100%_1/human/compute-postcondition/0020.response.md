The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the initial state already specifies that the current value of `i` is either less than the current value of `start` or greater than the current value of `end`, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the code and move to the next iteration without changing any values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of values of `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 value, `i` is the next value in the list, `count_num` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` is either less than the current value of `start` or greater than the current value of `end`.**
