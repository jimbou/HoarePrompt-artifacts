Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0, the current value of `i` is the first element in the list `num` and either `i` is less than `start` or `i` is greater than `end`, we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the first element in the list `num`, and the condition that either `i` is less than `start` or `i` is greater than `end` still holds. The only change is that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
