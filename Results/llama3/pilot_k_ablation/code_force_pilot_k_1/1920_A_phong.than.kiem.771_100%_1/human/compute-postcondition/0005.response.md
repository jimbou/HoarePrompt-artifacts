Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `start` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer in {1,2,3} and the current value of `t` is 1, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `i` is 0, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. The current value of `start` is equal to the current value of `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `start` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `v`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 inputs with the same format.
