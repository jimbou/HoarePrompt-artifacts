Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `end` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `num` is a list containing one integer `v`, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `i` is 0, stdin contains n-2 inputs: each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. If the current value of `t` was 1 and the original value of `start` was less than the current value of `v`, then `start` is updated to the current value of `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 2, then if `end` is greater than `v`, the program continues to execute with the updated values of `end` and `v`. The current value of `t` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `end` is still a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `num` now contains one integer `v`, `t` is still 3, `v` is still a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `i` is still 0. The stdin now contains n-2 inputs. The conditions for updating `start` and `end` remain the same.
