Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `num` is a list containing one integer `v`, `stdin` contains n-3 lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer and its current value is 3, `v` is an integer. If `t` was 1, then `start` is an integer and was equal to `v` if `start` was less than `v`. If `t` was 2, then `end` was updated to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include the integer `v` from the input. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one line has been read and processed. The values of the other variables remain the same, with `t` still being 3, `i` still being 0, and `n` still being between 2 and 100 inclusive. The conditions for `start` and `end` also remain the same, depending on the value of `t`.
