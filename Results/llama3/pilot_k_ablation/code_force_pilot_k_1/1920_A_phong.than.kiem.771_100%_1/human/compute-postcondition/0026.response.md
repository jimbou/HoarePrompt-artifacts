Functionality: **This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum value of 'v' when 't' is 1 and the minimum value of 'v' when 't' is 2, and the list of numbers is composed of 'v' values when 't' is 3. If the maximum value of 'v' when 't' is 1 is greater than the minimum value of 'v' when 't' is 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the range size and the count of numbers within the range.**
