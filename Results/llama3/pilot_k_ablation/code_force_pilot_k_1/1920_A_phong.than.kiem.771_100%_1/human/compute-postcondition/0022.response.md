Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of values of `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 value, `i` is the first value in the list, `count_num` is 1, `stdin` is empty. Additionally, `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), meaning `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The stdin remains empty.
