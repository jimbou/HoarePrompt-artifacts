Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 1, `i` is the first element in the list `num`, stdin is empty. The first element `i` in the list `num` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `count_num` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true.
