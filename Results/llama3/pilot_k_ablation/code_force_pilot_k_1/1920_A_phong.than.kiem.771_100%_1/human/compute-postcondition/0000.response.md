Output State: **n is an integer, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is the first input, stdin now contains `n` inputs. The second line assigns the value -1 to `start`. The third line assigns the value 1000000000 to `end`. The fourth line initializes an empty list `num`. No other variables are affected.
