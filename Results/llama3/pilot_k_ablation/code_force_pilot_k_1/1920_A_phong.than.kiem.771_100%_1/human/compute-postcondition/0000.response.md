The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains n lines each containing two integers t and v. The second line assigns -1 to `start`. The third line assigns 1000000000 to `end`. The fourth line assigns an empty list to `num`. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines each containing two integers t and v**
