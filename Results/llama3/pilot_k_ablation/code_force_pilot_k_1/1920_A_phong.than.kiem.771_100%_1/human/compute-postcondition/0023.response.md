Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of values of `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 value. If the first value `i` in the list is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, then `i` is updated to the next value in the list and `count_num` remains 0. Otherwise, `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is set to 1, and `stdin` remains empty.***
