Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `num`. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 1. Otherwise, `count_num` is 0 and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
