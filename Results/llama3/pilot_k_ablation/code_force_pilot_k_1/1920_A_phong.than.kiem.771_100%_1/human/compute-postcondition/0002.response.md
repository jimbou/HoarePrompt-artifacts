Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer in {1,2,3}, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `i` is 0, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `t` and `v` are assigned the values of the first input from stdin, which contains two integers. The stdin now contains n-1 inputs, as one input has been consumed.
