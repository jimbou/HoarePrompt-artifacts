According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, `i` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the initial value of the range).

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0**
