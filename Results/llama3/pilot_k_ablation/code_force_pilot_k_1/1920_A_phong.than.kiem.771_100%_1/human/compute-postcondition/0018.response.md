To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `num`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`. If the list `num` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `num` must have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in the list `num`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `num`, stdin is empty.**
