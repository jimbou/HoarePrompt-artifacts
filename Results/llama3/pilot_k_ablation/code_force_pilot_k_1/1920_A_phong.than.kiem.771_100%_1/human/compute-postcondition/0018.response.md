The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`. If the list has at least 1 value the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `count_num` is 0, `stdin` is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 value and the i is the first value in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of values of `v` when `t` is 3 that must have at least 1 value, `i` is the first value in the list, `count_num` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
