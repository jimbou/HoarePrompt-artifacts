Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer and its current value is 2, `v` is an integer. If `t` was 1, then `start` is an integer and is equal to `v` if `start` is less than `v`.**
