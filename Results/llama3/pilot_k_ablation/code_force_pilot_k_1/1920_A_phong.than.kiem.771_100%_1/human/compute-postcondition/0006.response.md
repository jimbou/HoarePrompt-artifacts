Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer with a current value of 1, `v` is an integer. If `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is an integer and is equal to `v`, and the current value of `start` is less than or equal to the current value of `v`.***
