Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 1, then `start` is an integer and is equal to `v` if `start` is less than `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is updated to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.***
