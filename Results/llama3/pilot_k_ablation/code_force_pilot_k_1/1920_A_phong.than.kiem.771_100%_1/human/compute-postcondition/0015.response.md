Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `num` is a list containing one integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers t and v if `t` is not 3, otherwise `stdin` contains n-3 lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` was 1, then `start` is an integer and was equal to `v` if `start` was less than `v`. If `t` was 2, then `end` was updated to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`.***
