Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `end` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer with a current value of 2, `v` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `i` is 0, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. If the current value of `t` was 1 and the original value of `start` was less than the current value of `v`, then `start` is updated to the current value of `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `end` has been updated to the current value of `v`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 inputs. The condition regarding the original value of `start` and its possible update remains the same.
