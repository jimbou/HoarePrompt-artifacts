Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `end` is equal to `v`, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer and its current value is 2, `v` is an integer. If `t` was 1, then `start` is an integer and is equal to `v` if `start` is less than `v`. The current value of `end` is equal to the current value of `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `end` is higher than `v` is no longer true, as they are now equal.
