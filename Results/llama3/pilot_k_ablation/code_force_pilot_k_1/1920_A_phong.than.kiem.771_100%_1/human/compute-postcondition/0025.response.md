Output State: **The program returns the difference between the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, plus 1, minus the number of values in `num` that are within the range of the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 and the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2 (inclusive), if the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 is less than or equal to the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, otherwise it returns 0.**
