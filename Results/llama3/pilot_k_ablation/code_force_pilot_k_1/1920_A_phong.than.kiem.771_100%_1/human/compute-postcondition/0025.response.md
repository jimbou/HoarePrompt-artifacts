Output State: **The program returns the difference between the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), but only if the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 is less than or equal to the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, otherwise it returns 0.**
