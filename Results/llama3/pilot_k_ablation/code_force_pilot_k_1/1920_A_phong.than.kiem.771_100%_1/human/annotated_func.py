#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return 1 or to return an integer read from the standard input.

        #The program returns an integer read from the standard input.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1, which is an integer value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input parameter 'isOne'. If 'isOne' is False, it reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. If 'isOne' is True, it returns the integer value 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value indicating whether the input should be split into items based on spaces, to_int is a boolean value indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string containing the input from stdin, stdin is empty. If `space` is true, `items` is a list of substrings split from `line` based on spaces. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters in `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is true, the list contains integers converted from substrings split from the input string `line` based on spaces. Otherwise, the list contains integers converted from individual characters in the input string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of substrings or characters from the input string 'line'. If 'space' is true, the list contains substrings split from 'line' based on spaces. Otherwise, the list contains individual characters from 'line'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into items based on spaces if specified, and returns the items as either a list of substrings or a list of integers if conversion to integers is specified. The function takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`, which determine how the input is processed. If `space` is true, the input is split into substrings based on spaces; otherwise, it is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is true, the resulting items are converted to integers. The function returns the processed list of items, which can be either a list of integers or a list of substrings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and sym is a string.

        string += str(i) + sym

    return string
    #The program returns a string that contains all integers in the list 'arr' separated by the string 'sym'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers and a string as input, and returns a string that contains all integers in the list separated by the input string. The input list and string remain unchanged. The function effectively concatenates the string representation of each integer in the list, interspersed with the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: indices contains all the indices of all occurrences of substring in string, index is -1
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices that contains all the indices of all occurrences of a substring in a string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting positions of these occurrences. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values and element is a value such that element is present in arr.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the element is found in the list 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It takes a list and an element as input and returns a list of indices where the element is found. If the element is not present in the list, it returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of integers, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is an integer.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:

    #State: `arr` is a 2D list of integers, `index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `index` < `len(arr[0])`, `value` is an integer, and either the function has returned a sub-array where the element at position `index` is equal to `value`, or the loop has finished iterating over all sub-arrays without finding a match, in which case the function has not returned a sub-array.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all sub-arrays without finding a match where the element at position `index` is equal to `value`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches a 2D list of integers for a sub-array where the element at a specified index matches a given value, returning the first matching sub-array if found, or None if no match is found after iterating over all sub-arrays.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n, and then n lines each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000000000.

        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3, stdin is empty.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of all `v` when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), but only if the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 is less than or equal to the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, otherwise it returns 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum value of 'v' when 't' is 1 and the minimum value of 'v' when 't' is 2, and the list of numbers is composed of 'v' values when 't' is 3. If the maximum value of 'v' when 't' is 1 is greater than the minimum value of 'v' when 't' is 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the range size and the count of numbers within the range.
