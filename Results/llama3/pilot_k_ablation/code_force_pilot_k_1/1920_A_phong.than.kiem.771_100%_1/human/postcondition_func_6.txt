This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not included in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum and minimum values of 'v' when 't' is 1 and 2, respectively, and the list of numbers is defined by the values of 'v' when 't' is 3. The function returns the count of integers within the range that are not in the list, or 0 if the range is invalid.
