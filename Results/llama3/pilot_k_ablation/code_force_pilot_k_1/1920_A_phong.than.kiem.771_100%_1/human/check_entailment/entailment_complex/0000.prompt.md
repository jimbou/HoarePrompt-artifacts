Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

for i in ans:
    print(i)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value.
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value that is provided by the user through input. The value of isOne is not used in the return statement, so it remains False.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, the function prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it. If `isOne` is True, the function returns the number 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value, to_int is a boolean value.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string. If `space` is true, `items` is a list of substrings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, `items` is a list of characters in `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is true, the list contains integers converted from substrings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, the list contains integers converted from individual characters in `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of substrings or characters from the string 'line'. If 'space' is true, the list contains substrings split from 'line' by spaces. If 'space' is false, the list contains individual characters from 'line'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, the function splits the input line into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the input line as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, the function converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers. The function then returns the processed list, which can contain either integers or substrings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and sym is a string of length 1.
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `sym` is a string of length 1, `string` is a concatenation of the string representation of all integers in `arr` separated by `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is a concatenation of the string representation of all integers in the list `arr`, separated by the string `sym` of length 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers and a single-character string as input, and returns a string where the integer values are concatenated together, separated by the provided separator string. The input list and separator string remain unchanged. The function effectively converts the list of integers into a single string, with the separator string used to delimit the integer values.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: string is a string, substring is a string, indices is a list containing all the indices of all occurrences of substring in string, index is -1
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices containing all the indices of all occurrences of substring in string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting positions of these occurrences. The function accepts two parameters: a string and a substring, and returns a list of indices. If the substring is not found in the string, the function returns an empty list.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values and element is a value of any type such that element is present in arr.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the element is found in the list 'arr'. The list 'arr' contains a collection of values, and the element is a value of any type that is present in 'arr'. The returned list contains the positions of the element in 'arr', with the first occurrence having an index of 0, the second occurrence having an index of 1, and so on.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It takes a list 'arr' and an element as input, and returns a list of indices where the element is found in 'arr', with the first occurrence having an index of 0, the second occurrence having an index of 1, and so on. If the element is not found in the list, it will return an empty list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of lists, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is a value of any type.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: arr is a 2D list of lists, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), value is a value of any type, either a sub-array in arr has an element at index equal to value and the function has returned that sub-array, or no sub-array in arr has an element at index equal to value and the function has not returned anything.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sub-array in arr has an element at index equal to value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches a 2D list of lists for a sub-array that contains a specified value at a specified index. If such a sub-array is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns None, indicating that no matching sub-array was found.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines each containing two integers t and v (t in {1,2,3} and 1 <= v <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    start = -1

    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list of values of `v` when `t` is 3, `stdin` is empty.
    count_num = 0

    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, plus 1, minus the number of values in `num` that are within the range of the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 and the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2 (inclusive), if the maximum of -1 and the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1 is less than or equal to the minimum of 1000000000 and the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, otherwise it returns 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not included in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum and minimum values of 'v' when 't' is 1 and 2, respectively, and the list of numbers is defined by the values of 'v' when 't' is 3. The function returns the count of integers within the range that are not in the list, or 0 if the range is invalid.
