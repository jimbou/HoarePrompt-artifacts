Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, the function prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it. If `isOne` is True, the function returns the number 1.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, the function splits the input line into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the input line as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, the function converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers. The function then returns the processed list, which can contain either integers or substrings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function takes a list of integers and a single-character string as input, and returns a string where the integer values are concatenated together, separated by the provided separator string. The input list and separator string remain unchanged. The function effectively converts the list of integers into a single string, with the separator string used to delimit the integer values.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting positions of these occurrences. The function accepts two parameters: a string and a substring, and returns a list of indices. If the substring is not found in the string, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It takes a list 'arr' and an element as input, and returns a list of indices where the element is found in 'arr', with the first occurrence having an index of 0, the second occurrence having an index of 1, and so on. If the element is not found in the list, it will return an empty list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  This function searches a 2D list of lists for a sub-array that contains a specified value at a specified index. If such a sub-array is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns None, indicating that no matching sub-array was found.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not included in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum and minimum values of 'v' when 't' is 1 and 2, respectively, and the list of numbers is defined by the values of 'v' when 't' is 3. The function returns the count of integers within the range that are not in the list, or 0 if the range is invalid.
