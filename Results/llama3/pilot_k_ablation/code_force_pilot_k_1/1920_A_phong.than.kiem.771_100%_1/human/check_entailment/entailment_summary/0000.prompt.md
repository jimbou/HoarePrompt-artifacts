Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function returns an integer value based on the input parameter 'isOne'. If 'isOne' is False, it reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. If 'isOne' is True, it returns the integer value 1.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into items based on spaces if specified, and returns the items as either a list of substrings or a list of integers if conversion to integers is specified. The function takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`, which determine how the input is processed. If `space` is true, the input is split into substrings based on spaces; otherwise, it is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is true, the resulting items are converted to integers. The function returns the processed list of items, which can be either a list of integers or a list of substrings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function takes a list of integers and a string as input, and returns a string that contains all integers in the list separated by the input string. The input list and string remain unchanged. The function effectively concatenates the string representation of each integer in the list, interspersed with the input string.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting positions of these occurrences. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It takes a list and an element as input and returns a list of indices where the element is found. If the element is not present in the list, it returns an empty list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Searches a 2D list of integers for a sub-array where the element at a specified index matches a given value, returning the first matching sub-array if found, or None if no match is found after iterating over all sub-arrays.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum value of 'v' when 't' is 1 and the minimum value of 'v' when 't' is 2, and the list of numbers is composed of 'v' values when 't' is 3. If the maximum value of 'v' when 't' is 1 is greater than the minimum value of 'v' when 't' is 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the range size and the count of numbers within the range.
