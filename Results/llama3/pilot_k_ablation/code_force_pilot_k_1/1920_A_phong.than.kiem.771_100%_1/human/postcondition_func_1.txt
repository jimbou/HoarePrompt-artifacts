This function reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into items based on spaces if specified, and returns the items as either a list of substrings or a list of integers if conversion to integers is specified. The function takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`, which determine how the input is processed. If `space` is true, the input is split into substrings based on spaces; otherwise, it is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is true, the resulting items are converted to integers. The function returns the processed list of items, which can be either a list of integers or a list of substrings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
