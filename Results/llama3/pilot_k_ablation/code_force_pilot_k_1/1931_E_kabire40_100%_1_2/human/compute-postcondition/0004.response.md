Output State: **`rev_res` is updated by appending the string `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed, `x` is still an even number, `y` is still 0, `list_len` is a string that must be a positive integer, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of each string and the length of the string without trailing zeros, stdin contains a sequence of lines minus 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed. The value of `x` remains an even number, and the values of `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of lines minus 2 lines.
