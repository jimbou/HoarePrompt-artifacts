To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `list_len`. The loop will execute if `list_len` is a positive integer, because `range()` requires an integer argument. Since `x` is the loop variable, it will take on values from 0 to `int(list_len) - 1`.

State: **stdin contains a sequence of lines minus 2 lines, list_len is a string that must be a positive integer, max_power is a string, operational_list is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of each string and the length of the string without trailing zeros, y is 0, x is 0**
