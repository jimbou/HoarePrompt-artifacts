The only variable in the loop head is variable `y` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a sequence of lines, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `y` is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains a sequence of lines, `input()` must be greater than 0, `y` is 0**
