Postcondition: ***stdin contains a sequence of lines minus 2 lines, list_len is a string that must be a positive integer, max_power is a string, operational_list is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of each string and the length of the string without trailing zeros, y is 0. If x is even, rev_res is updated by appending the string operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is increased by the value of operational_list[x].***
