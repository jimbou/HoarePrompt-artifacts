Output State: **`rev_res` is increased by the value of `operational_list[x]`, `x` is an odd number, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string that must be a positive integer, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of each string and the length of the string without trailing zeros, stdin contains a sequence of lines minus 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by adding the value of `operational_list[x]`, where `x` is an odd number. The values of `x`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of lines minus 2 lines.
