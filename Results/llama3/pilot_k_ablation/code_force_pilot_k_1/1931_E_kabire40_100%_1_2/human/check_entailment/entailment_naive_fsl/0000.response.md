Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The problem description states that Sasha must extract two elements from the list, concatenate them in any order, and insert the result back into the list. However, the program does not implement this step correctly. It simply concatenates the elements in the order they appear in the list, without considering all possible concatenations.

For example, consider the input:

3 5
9 56 1

The program will output "Anna", but this is incorrect. Sasha can extract the elements 9 and 56, concatenate them to form 956, and insert the result back into the list. Then, Anna can reverse the element 1 to form 1. Sasha can then extract the elements 956 and 1, concatenate them to form 9561, and insert the result back into the list. Since 9561 is greater than or equal to 10^5, Sasha wins.

The program does not consider this possibility and incorrectly outputs "Anna". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
