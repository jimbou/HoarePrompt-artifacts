This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a sequence of lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes these integers, combines them into a string, removes trailing zeros from even-indexed strings, and checks if the length of the resulting string is greater than or equal to m + 1. Based on this check, it prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving stdin with a reduced number of lines and printing the results of the comparisons.
