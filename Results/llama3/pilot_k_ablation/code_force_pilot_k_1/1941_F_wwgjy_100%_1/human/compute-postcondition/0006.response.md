Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `f` is a list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. The current value of `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.**
