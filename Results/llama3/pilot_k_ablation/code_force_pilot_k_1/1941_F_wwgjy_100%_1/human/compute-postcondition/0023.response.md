The code prints the first element of the `gap` list, which is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences and values of consecutive elements in the list `a`. Since the exact elements of `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the first element of `gap`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the list `a`.

Output: **the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the list a**
