Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `f` is a list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is not equal to `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `_`, `i`, `remain`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. The value of `s` is still `f[j] + b[i]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.
