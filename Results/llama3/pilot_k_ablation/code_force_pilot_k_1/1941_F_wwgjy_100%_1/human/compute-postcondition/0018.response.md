Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `f[j - 1] + b[i]` is less than `end`, then the current value of `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `j`.**
