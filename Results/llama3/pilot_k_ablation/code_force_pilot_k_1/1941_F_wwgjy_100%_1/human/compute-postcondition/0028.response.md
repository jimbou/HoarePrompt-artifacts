Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `f` are lists of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd` are integers, `res` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all `s` that are equal to `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` where `j` is the index of the insertion point of `mid - b[i]` in `f` and `i` is an integer from 0 to `m - 1`, `i` is `m`, `remain` is not defined, `j` is not defined, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the list `gap` is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all `s` that are equal to `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` where `j` is the index of the insertion point of `mid - b[i]` in `f` and `i` is an integer from 0 to `m - 1` is printed.***
