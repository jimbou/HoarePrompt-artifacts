Output State: **The program has finished processing all test cases from the standard input. The values of variables n, m, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, res are undefined because they are local to the loop and are reinitialized in each iteration. The loop has printed the minimum difference between the sum of an element from list b and an element from list f that falls within the range of two consecutive elements in list a, or the difference between two consecutive elements in list a if no such sum is found, for each test case.**
