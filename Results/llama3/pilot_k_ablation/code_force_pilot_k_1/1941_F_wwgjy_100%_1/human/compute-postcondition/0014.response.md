Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `s`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then the current value of `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1.***
