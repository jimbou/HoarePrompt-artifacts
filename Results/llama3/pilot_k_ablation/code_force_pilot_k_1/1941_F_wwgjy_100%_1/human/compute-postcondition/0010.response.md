Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `f` is a list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity, `_` is 0, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is not equal to `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been calculated as the sum of the `j-th` element of list `f` and the `i-th` element of list `b`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.
