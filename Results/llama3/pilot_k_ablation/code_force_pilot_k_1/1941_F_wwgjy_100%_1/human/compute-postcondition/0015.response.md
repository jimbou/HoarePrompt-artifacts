Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `f[j - 1] + b[i]` is less than `end`, then the current value of `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables maintain their previous values as described in the precondition. The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]`. The value of `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, but only if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. The value of `j` remains greater than or equal to 1.
