Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, where `s` is the current value of `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. The value of `s` is still greater than `start` and less than `end`.
