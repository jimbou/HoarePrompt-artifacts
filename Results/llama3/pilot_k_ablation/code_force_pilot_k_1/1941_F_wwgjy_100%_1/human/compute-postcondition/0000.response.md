The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least 1 test case and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
