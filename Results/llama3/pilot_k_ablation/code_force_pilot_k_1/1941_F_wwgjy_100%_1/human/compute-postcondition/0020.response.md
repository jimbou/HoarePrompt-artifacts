Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `s` is either equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]` if `j` is equal to `k`, or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains the same.***
