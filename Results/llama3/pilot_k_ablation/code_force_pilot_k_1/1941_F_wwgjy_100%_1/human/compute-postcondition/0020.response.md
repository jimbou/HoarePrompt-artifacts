Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `j` is equal to `k`, then `res` is infinity if `start` is not less than `s` or `s` is not less than `end`, otherwise `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `f[j - 1] + b[i]` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`, and `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Otherwise, if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
