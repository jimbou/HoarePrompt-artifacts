Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. The current value of `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`. The current value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1. `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Additionally, the value of `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.***
