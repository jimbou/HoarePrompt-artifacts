Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `f` is a list of integers, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity if `start` is not less than `s` or `s` is not less than `end`, otherwise `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`.***
