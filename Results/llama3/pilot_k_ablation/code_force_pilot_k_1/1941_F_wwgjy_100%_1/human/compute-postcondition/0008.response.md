Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences and values of consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`.***
