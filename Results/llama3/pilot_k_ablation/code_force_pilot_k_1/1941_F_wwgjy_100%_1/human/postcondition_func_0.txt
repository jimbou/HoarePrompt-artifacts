This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains four lines of integers. It calculates and prints the minimum difference between the sum of an element from the second list and an element from the third list that falls within the range of two consecutive elements in the first list. If no such sum is found, it prints the difference between two consecutive elements in the first list. The function iterates over all test cases, printing the result for each case.
