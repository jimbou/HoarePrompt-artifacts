Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer at least 1, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set**

Explanation:

* The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `int(input())` must be at least 1, `n` becomes an integer at least 1. This also reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1, so stdin now contains t-1 test cases.
* The second line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. This list of integers is now stored in `arr`.
* The third line creates an empty set `s`. No other variables are affected.

Note that the value of `_` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
