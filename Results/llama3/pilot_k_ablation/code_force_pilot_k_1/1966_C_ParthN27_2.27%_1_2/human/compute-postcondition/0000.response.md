The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains t test cases, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
