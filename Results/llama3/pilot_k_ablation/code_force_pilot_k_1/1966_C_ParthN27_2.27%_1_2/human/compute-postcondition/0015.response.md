Postcondition: ***_ is 0, n is at least 3, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of unique elements of arr with a 0 prepended, stdin contains t-2 test cases if the difference between the current element of s and the previous element of s is greater than 1, otherwise, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, and ans is 1 if the difference between the current element of s and the previous element of s is greater than 1, otherwise, ans is 0.***
