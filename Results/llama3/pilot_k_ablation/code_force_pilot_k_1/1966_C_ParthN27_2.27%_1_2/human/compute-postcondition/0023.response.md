Postcondition: ***_ is 0, n is the number of unique elements in arr plus 1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of unique elements of arr with a 0 prepended, i is n-1. If there is a pair of adjacent elements in s with a difference greater than 1, then ans is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, ans is 0, stdin contains t test cases, and 'Bob' is being printed.***
