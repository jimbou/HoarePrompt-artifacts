Output State: **_ is 0, n is the number of unique elements in arr plus 1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of unique elements of arr with a 0 prepended, i is n-1, ans is 1 if there is a pair of adjacent elements in s with a difference greater than 1, otherwise ans is 0 if the difference between all adjacent elements in s is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases if there is a pair of adjacent elements in s with a difference greater than 1, otherwise, stdin contains t test cases.**
