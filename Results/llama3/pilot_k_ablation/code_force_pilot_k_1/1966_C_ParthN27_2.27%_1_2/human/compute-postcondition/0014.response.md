The value of `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so the new value of `ans` is 1 - 1 = 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *_ is 0, n is at least 3, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of unique elements of arr with a 0 prepended, i is 1, ans is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is less than or equal to 1.
