Postcondition: ***_ is 0, n is the number of unique elements in arr plus 1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of unique elements of arr with a 0 prepended, i is n-1, ans is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is 2, then 'Alice' is being printed. If n is more than 2, then if there is a pair of adjacent elements in s with a difference greater than 1, then 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Bob' is being printed.***
