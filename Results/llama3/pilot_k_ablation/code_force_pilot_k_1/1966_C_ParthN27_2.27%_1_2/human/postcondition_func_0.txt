This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It determines the winner of a game based on the number of pairs of adjacent unique elements with a difference of 1. If the number of such pairs is even, 'Alice' wins; otherwise, 'Bob' wins. The function prints the winner for each test case and empties the standard input.
