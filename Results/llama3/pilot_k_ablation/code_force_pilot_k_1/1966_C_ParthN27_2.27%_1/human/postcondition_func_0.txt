This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n and a list of n integers. It determines the winner of a game based on the list of integers, printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case. The function iterates through all test cases, leaving the standard input empty and variables in a reset state after execution.
