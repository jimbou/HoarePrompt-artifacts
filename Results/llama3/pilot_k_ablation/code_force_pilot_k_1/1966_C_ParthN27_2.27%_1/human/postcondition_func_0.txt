This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then determines the winner of a game based on the uniqueness and sequence of the integers, printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console for each test case. The function consumes all input from standard input, leaving it empty upon completion.
