Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game by analyzing the differences between the sizes of the piles. The key insight is that the game can be won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the differences between the sizes of the piles.

The program first reads the input and creates a set of unique pile sizes. It then sorts the set and adds a dummy element 0 at the beginning. The program then iterates through the sorted set and checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element is greater than 1. If it is, the program breaks the loop and prints "Alice" as the winner. If the loop completes without finding such a difference, the program prints "Bob" as the winner.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the condition under which Alice can win the game. If the differences between the sizes of the piles are all 1, then Alice can win by making the last move. Otherwise, Bob can win by making the last move.

Correctness: **True**
