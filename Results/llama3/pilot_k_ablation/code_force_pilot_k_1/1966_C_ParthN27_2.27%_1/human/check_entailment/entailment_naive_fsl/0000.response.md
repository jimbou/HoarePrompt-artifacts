Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the answer. The program sorts the unique pile sizes and then iterates through them, flipping the answer (0 or 1) whenever it encounters a gap of more than 1 between two consecutive pile sizes. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual number of piles of each size.

For example, consider the input:

3
1 2 2

The program will output "Bob", but the correct answer is "Alice". The reason is that Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving two piles of size 1, and then Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the XOR operation. The XOR of all the pile sizes determines the winner of the game. If the XOR is 0, then Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the XOR operation has the property that a ^ a = 0 and a ^ 0 = a, which corresponds to the rules of the game.
