Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the way the program checks for the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes. The program only checks if the difference is greater than 1, but it does not consider the case where the difference is 1 and the number of piles is even.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "Alice", but the correct output should be "Bob". This is because Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving 2 stones in each pile. Then, Bob can remove 2 stones from each pile, leaving 0 stones in each pile and winning the game.

The program does not correctly handle this case because it only checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1, and it does not consider the parity of the number of piles.
