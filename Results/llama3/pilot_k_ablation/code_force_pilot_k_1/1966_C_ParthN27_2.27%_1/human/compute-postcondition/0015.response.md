Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of n integers from the current test case, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr`. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is less than or equal to 1. `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.***
