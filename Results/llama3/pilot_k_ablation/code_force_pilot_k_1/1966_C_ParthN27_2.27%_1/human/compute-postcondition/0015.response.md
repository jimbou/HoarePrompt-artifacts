Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and `_` is 0. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
