To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of n integers from the current test case, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases**
