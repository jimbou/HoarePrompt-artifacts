To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2 (since the range starts at 1 and ends at `n-1`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
