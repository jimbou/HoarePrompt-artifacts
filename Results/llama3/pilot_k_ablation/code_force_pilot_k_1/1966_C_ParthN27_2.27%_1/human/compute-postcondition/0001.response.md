Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**.

The code block reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. It then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The third line initializes an empty set `s`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin is left with at least 1 test case minus the 2 inputs that were read.
