Postcondition: ***n is the length of the list s plus 1, s is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is greater than 2, then if the difference between consecutive elements in list s is not greater than 1 for all indices from 1 to n-2, then 'Alice' is printed and ans is 1. Otherwise, 'Bob' is printed and ans is 0, meaning the difference between consecutive elements in list s is greater than 1 for at least one index from 1 to n-2.***
