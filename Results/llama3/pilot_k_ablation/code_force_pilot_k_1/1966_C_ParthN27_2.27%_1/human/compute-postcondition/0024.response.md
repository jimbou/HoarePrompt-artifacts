Postcondition: ***n is the number of unique elements in arr plus one, arr is a list of n integers from the current test case, s is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from arr, ans is 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is greater than 2, then if the differences between consecutive elements in s are all less than or equal to 1, 'Alice' is printed and ans is 1, otherwise 'Bob' is printed and ans is 0.***
