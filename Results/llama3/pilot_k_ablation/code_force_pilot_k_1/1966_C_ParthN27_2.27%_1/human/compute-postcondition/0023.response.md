Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers from the current test case, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `ans` is 1 if the differences between consecutive elements in `s` are all less than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases. If `ans` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, 'Bob' is printed.***
