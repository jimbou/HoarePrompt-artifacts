Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0. If the difference between consecutive elements in list `s` is not greater than 1 for all indices from 1 to `n-2`, then `ans` is 1 and 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, meaning the difference between consecutive elements in list `s` is greater than 1 for at least one index from 1 to `n-2`, and 'Bob' is printed.***
