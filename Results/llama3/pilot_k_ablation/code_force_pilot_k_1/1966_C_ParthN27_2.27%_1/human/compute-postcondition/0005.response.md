Output State: **n is the length of the list s plus 1, s is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is now the length of the list `s` plus 1. The list `s` contains the integer 0 and the first `n` elements of the original list `arr`. The variable `ans` has been assigned the value 1. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, containing at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
