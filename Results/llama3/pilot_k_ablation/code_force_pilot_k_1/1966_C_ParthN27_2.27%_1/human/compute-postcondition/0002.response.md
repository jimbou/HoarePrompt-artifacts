To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the number of integers in the current test case, which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers from the current test case, `s` is an empty set, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases**
