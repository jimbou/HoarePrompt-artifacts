Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of n integers from the current test case, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is less than or equal to 1**

The value of `ans` is toggled from 1 to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The state of `s` is still valid, meaning the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is still less than or equal to 1.
