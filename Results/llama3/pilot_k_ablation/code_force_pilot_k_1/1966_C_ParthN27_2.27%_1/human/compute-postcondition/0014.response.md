Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `s` is less than or equal to 1**

The code `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` from 1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 and the first n elements of the original list arr, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `s` is less than or equal to 1 is still valid after the code has been executed.
