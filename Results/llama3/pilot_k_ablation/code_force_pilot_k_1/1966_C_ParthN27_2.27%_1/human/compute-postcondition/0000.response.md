The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least 1 test case and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
