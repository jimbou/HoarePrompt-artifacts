Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' characters (P) and '-' characters (M) in the input string. The minimum possible penalty is then calculated as the absolute difference between P and M, which is the sum of the penalties of the subarrays.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string contains only '+' characters or only '-' characters, as well as the case where the input string contains a mix of '+' and '-' characters.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string is empty, as the absolute difference between P and M will be 0 in this case.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
