Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It initializes two counters, `P` and `M`, to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.
4. It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '+', it increments `P`. If the character is '-', it increments `M`.
5. After counting all characters, it prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program correctly implements the problem description. The key insight is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the string is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the absolute value of 1 or -1 is 1.

By counting the number of '+' and '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the sum of the entire string. The absolute difference between `P` and `M` represents the minimum possible penalty, as it corresponds to the sum of the subarrays with the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
