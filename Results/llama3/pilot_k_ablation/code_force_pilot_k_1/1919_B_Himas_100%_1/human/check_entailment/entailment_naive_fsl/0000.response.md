Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and then printing the absolute difference between the two counts. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together. The program correctly implements this logic and handles all potential cases.
