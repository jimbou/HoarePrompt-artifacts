Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program correctly calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which correspond to 1 and -1 in the array, respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is sound because it takes advantage of the fact that the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. By calculating the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty that can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays with sums that are as close to zero as possible.

The program's implementation is also efficient, as it only requires a single pass through the input string to calculate the counts of '+' and '-' characters. Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
