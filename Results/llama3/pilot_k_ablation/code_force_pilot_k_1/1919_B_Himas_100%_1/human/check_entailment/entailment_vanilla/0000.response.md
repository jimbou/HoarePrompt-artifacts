Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func` that takes no arguments. Inside the function, it iterates over a range of integers from 0 to the number of test cases minus 1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it reads an integer `s` representing the length of the string, and a string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.

The program then initializes two variables, `P` and `M`, to 0. It iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', it increments `P` by 1; otherwise, it increments `M` by 1.

Finally, the program prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and taking the absolute difference between them. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in a single subarray with a sum equal to the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
