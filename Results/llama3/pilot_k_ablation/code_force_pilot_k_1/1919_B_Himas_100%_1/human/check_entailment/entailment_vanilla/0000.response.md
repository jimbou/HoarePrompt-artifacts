Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum possible penalty that can be achieved by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which correspond to 1 and -1 in the array, respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and prints this value as the minimum possible penalty.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual splitting of the array into subarrays. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not necessarily the minimum possible penalty.

For example, consider the input string "++--". The program would count 2 '+' characters and 2 '-' characters, and calculate the absolute difference as 0. However, the minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into two subarrays, "[1, 1]" and "[-1, -1]", which would result in a penalty of 2.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
