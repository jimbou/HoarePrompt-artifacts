Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and printing the absolute difference between these counts. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together. The absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters gives the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
