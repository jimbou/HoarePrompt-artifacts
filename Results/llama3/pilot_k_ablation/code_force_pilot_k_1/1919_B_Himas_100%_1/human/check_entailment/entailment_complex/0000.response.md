Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string, and prints the result.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It iterates over each character in the string, increments the count of '+' characters (P) or '-' characters (M) accordingly, and then prints the absolute difference between P and M.

The program also handles the input correctly, reading the number of test cases, the length of each string (which is not actually used in the program), and the string itself.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, and it should produce the correct output for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
