This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string input. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty.
