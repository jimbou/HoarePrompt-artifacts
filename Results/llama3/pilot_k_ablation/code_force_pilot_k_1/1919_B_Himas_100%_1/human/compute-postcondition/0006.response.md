The value of `M` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `M` was 0, so the new value of `M` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. `q` is still the first character in `e` and is not '+'. `e` still has at least 1 character. `s` is still an integer. `P` is still 0. `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `i` is 0, `q` is the first character in `e` and is not '+', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
