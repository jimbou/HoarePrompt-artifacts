Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a string that is not empty, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one fewer input than initially, `q` is the first character in the string `e` and `q` is not '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `M` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `i` still being 0, `s` being an integer, `e` being a non-empty string, `P` being 0, and `q` being the first character in the string `e` and not '+'. The stdin still contains at least one fewer input than initially.
