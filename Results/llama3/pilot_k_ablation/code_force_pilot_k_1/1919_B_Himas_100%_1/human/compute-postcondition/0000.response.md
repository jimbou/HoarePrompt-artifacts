According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns a value that can be converted to an integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input() function must return a value that can be converted to an integer and i is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `i` is 0, input() must return a value that can be converted to an integer**
