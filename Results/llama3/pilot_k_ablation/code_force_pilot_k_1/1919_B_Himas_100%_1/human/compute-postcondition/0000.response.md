To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from `stdin` that can be converted to an integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure it contains at least one integer.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer, `i` is 0**

Note that we don't need to adjust the state of `n` or `s` because they are not part of the loop head. The loop will execute as long as there is input from `stdin`, regardless of the value of `n` or the contents of `s`.
