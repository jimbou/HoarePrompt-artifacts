Output State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is the first character in `e` and equals to '+', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
