To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`. The loop will execute if `e` has at least one character. 

State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 0, `M` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is the first character in `e`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
