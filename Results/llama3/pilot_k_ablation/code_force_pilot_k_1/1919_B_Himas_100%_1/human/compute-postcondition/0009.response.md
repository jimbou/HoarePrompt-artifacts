The code prints the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters in the string `e` and the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

Since the exact string `e` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `P` and `M`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the absolute difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string e**
