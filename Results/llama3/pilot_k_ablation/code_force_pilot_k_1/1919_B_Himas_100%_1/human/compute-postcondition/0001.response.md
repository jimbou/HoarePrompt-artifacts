The code snippet reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `s`, then reads another input from stdin and assigns it to `e`. It also initializes two variables, `P` and `M`, to 0.

Since `i` is 0 initially, it is not affected by the code snippet.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `s` is an integer value read from stdin.
- `e` is a string value read from stdin.
- `P` is 0.
- `M` is 0.
- `i` is still 0.

The stdin now contains one less test case than initially.

Output State: **s is an integer, e is a string, P is 0, M is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
