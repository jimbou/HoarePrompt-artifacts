Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string `t` contains only 'L' or only 'R' characters. In such cases, the variables `q1` and `q2` are not initialized correctly, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is `n = 5, m = 1, a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], t = 'LLLLL'`, the program will produce incorrect output because `q1` and `q2` are not initialized correctly.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the cases when `t` contains only 'L' or only 'R' characters separately, and initialize `q1` and `q2` accordingly.
