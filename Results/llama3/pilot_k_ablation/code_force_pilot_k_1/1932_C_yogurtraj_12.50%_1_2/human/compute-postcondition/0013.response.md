Postcondition: **ii is 0, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of m integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is the remainder of either the (l-1)th or lth element of a divided by m depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not, q1 is either l-2 or l-1 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not, q2 is either l or l+1 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not, y is the string representation of k, and stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n-2. If t[i] is 'R', k is multiplied by the (l+1)th element of a and q2 is either l+1 or l+2 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not. Otherwise, k is the remainder of either the (l-2)th or (l-1)th element of a divided by m depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not, q1 is either l-3 or l-2 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not, and q2 is either l or l+1 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' or not.**
