Postcondition: ***ii is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of m integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of the string t is 'L', then k is the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a divided by m, q1 is l-2, and q2 is l. If the last character of t is not 'L', then k is the remainder of the lth element of a divided by m, q1 is l - 1, and q2 is l + 1.***
