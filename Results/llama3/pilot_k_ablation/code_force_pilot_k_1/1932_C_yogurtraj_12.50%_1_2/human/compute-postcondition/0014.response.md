Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `k` is the remainder of either the `(l-1)`th or `l`th element of `a` divided by `m` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` is either `l-2` or `l-1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q2` is either `l` or `l+1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n-2`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is multiplied by the `(l+1)`th element of `a` and `q2` is either `l+1` or `l+2` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not. Otherwise, `k` is the remainder of either the `(l-2)`th or `(l-1)`th element of `a` divided by `m` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` is either `l-3` or `l-2` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, and `q2` is either `l` or `l+1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `y` has been updated to include the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
