Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `k` is the remainder of the product of the elements of `a` corresponding to the 'R' and 'L' characters in `t` (in reverse order) divided by `m`, `q1` is either `l-2` or `l-1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q2` is either `l` or `l+1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `y` is the string representation of the remainders of the product of the elements of `a` corresponding to the 'R' and 'L' characters in `t` (in reverse order) divided by `m`, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is -1.**
