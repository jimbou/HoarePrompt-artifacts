Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `k` is the remainder of either the `(l-1)`th or `l`th element of `a` divided by `m` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` is either `l-2` or `l-1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q2` is either `l` or `l+1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `y` is the string representation of `k`, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that a new variable `y` is introduced, which is the string representation of `k`. The value of `k` depends on whether the last character of the string `t` is 'L' or not. If it is 'L', then `k` is the remainder of the `(l-1)`th element of `a` divided by `m`, and if it is not 'L', then `k` is the remainder of the `l`th element of `a` divided by `m`. The values of `q1` and `q2` also depend on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
