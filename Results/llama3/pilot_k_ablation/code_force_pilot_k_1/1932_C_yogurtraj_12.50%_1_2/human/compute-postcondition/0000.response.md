The only variable in the loop head is variable ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ii and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input must be at least 1 and ii is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases, ii is 0**
