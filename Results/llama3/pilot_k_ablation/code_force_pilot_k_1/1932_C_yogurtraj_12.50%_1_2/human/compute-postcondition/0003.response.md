Output State: **ii is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of m integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a divided by m, q1 is l-2, q2 is l, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the last character of the string t is 'L'.**

The code executes in the following way: The first line assigns the remainder of the (l-1)th element of a divided by m to k. The second line assigns l-2 to q1. The third line assigns l to q2. No other variables are affected.
