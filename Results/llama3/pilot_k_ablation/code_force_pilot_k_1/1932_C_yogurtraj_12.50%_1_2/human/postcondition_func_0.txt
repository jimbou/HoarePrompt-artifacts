This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers, and a string of n characters ('L' and 'R'). It then calculates the remainders of the product of the elements of the list corresponding to the 'R' and 'L' characters in the string, divided by m, in reverse order. The function prints the string representation of these remainders for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and all variables used within the function are no longer defined.
