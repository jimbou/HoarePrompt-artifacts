The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, where the first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n), but the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is assigned to `t`. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, where the first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n), but the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is assigned to `t` and `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0**
