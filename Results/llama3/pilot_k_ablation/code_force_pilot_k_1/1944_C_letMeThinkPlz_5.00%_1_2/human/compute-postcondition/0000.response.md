Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, where the first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n), but the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is assigned to `t`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, each consisting of a single integer `n` and a line of `n` integers.
