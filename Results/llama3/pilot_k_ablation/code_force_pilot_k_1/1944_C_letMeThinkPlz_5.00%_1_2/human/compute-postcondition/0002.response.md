The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, and the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is assigned to `t`, `n` becomes the value of the first line of the second test case. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. Stdin now contains the remaining test cases. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `counter`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is an empty dictionary, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
