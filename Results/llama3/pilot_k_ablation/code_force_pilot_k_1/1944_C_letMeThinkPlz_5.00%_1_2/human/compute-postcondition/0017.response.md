Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in arr and the values are their respective frequencies, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, ans is either the smallest missing number in arr or the smallest number that appears only once in arr, once is True if ans is the smallest number that appears only once in arr, otherwise once is False. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and ans remains 0, and once remains False, and the value of ans is being printed**
