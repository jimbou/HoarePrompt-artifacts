You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        counter = {}
        
        for i in arr:
            counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        once = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
                ans = i
                break
            elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
                once = True
                ans = i + 1
                break
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in arr and the values are their respective frequencies, _ is t, stdin is empty, ans is either the smallest missing number in arr or the smallest number that appears only once in arr for each test case, once is True if ans is the smallest number that appears only once in arr for the last test case, otherwise once is False. The value of ans for each test case has been printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in arr and the values are their respective frequencies, _ is t, stdin is empty, ans is either the smallest missing number in arr or the smallest number that appears only once in arr for each test case, once is True if ans is the smallest number that appears only once in arr for the last test case, otherwise once is False. The value of ans for each test case has been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
