The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either the smallest missing number in the list `arr` or the smallest number that appears only once in `arr`. The value of `ans` depends on the contents of the list `arr` and the frequencies of its elements, as stored in the dictionary `counter`.

Output: **the smallest missing number in the list arr or the smallest number that appears only once in arr**
