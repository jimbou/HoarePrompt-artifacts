Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1, counter is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in arr and the values are their respective frequencies, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, n is greater than 0, and i is an integer. If the frequency of the element at index i in arr is 0, then ans is equal to the value of i. If the frequency of the element at index i in arr is greater than 0, then if the frequency of the element at index i in arr is 1 and once is False, ans is i + 1 and once is True. Otherwise, the values of ans and once remain unchanged.***
