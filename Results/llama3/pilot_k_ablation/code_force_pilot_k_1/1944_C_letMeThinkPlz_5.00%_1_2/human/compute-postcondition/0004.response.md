Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n-1` that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in `arr` and the value is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases**

In this output state, the code has updated the `counter` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the first element in the `arr` list and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `counter` dictionary now has at least one key-value pair, and the key is the first element in the `arr` list.
