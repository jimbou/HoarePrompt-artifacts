To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n-1`, the first element can be any integer in this range.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n-1` that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
