Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the array. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is missing from the array, it is the MEX of the array and the program prints it. If a number appears only once in the array and it is the first such number, the program prints the next number because Alice can choose the number that appears only once and Bob can choose the next number, resulting in a higher MEX.

The program correctly handles the case where the array contains all numbers from 0 to n-1, in which case the MEX is n. It also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, in which case the MEX is the smallest missing number.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the array, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the frequency of each number.

Correctness: **True**
