The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a space-separated list of integers**
