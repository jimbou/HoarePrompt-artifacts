The code `t = int(input().strip())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The `strip()` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer representing the number of books Alice has. This integer is read and assigned to the variable `t`.

The output state is: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the number of books Alice has, and the standard input still contains the remaining test cases, including the space-separated list of integers representing the number of pages in each book.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a space-separated list of integers**
