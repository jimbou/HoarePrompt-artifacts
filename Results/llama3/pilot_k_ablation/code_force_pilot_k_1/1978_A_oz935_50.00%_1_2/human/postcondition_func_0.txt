This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (number of books) followed by a space-separated list of integers (number of pages in each book). It then calculates and prints the sum of the number of pages in the last book and the number of pages in the second-largest book for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
