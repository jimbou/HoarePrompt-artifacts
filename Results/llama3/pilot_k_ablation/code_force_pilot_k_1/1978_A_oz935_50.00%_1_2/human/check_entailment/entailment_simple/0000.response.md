Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages in each book `ls`.
3. It removes the last book from the list `ls` and stores its pages in the variable `last`.
4. It sorts the remaining books in descending order and removes the book with the most pages, storing its pages in the variable `other`.
5. It prints the sum of the pages of the last book and the book with the most pages, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
