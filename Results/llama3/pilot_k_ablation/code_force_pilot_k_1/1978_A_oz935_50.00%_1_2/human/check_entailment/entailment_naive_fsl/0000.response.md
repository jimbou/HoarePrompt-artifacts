Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the largest number is not at the end of the list. For example, if the input is:

3
3 1 2

The program will output 4 (2 + 2), but the correct output should be 5 (3 + 2). The program assumes that the largest number is always at the end of the list, which is not necessarily true. 

To fix this, the program should find the two largest numbers in the list, regardless of their position. One way to do this is to sort the list in descending order and then add the first two elements. 

Here is the corrected code:

def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort(reverse=True)
        print(ls[0] + ls[1])
