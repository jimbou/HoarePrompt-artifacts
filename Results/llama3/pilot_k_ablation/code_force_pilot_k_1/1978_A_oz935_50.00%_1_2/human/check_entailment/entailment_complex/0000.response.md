Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages in each book `ls`.
3. It removes the last book from the list `ls` and stores its pages in the variable `last`.
4. It sorts the remaining books in descending order and removes the book with the most pages, storing its pages in the variable `other`.
5. It prints the sum of the pages in the last book `last` and the second-largest book `other`.

This solution is correct because it follows the problem description:

* It divides the books into two non-empty piles (one with the last book and one with the remaining books).
* It reads one book with the highest number of pages from each pile (the last book and the second-largest book).
* It prints the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there are only two books (in which case the last book is the largest and the second-largest book is the first book).

Correctness: **True**
