Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` is an integer such that 1 <= c <= 10^6, `d` is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, `r` is an integer equal to (n^2)/2, and `k` is 0. The first element of `l` is equal to the last element of `l`***
