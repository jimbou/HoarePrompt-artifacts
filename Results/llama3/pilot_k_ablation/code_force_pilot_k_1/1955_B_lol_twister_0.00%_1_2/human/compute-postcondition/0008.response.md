Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c is an integer such that 1 <= c <= 10^6, d is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10^6, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, and r is an integer equal to (n^2)/2. The middle element of l is equal to half of a***
