Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in `l`. The difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d).***
