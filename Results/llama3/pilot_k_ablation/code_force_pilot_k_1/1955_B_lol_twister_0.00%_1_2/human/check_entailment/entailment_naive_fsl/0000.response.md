Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly verify if the given array elements can form a progressive square for the given n, c, and d. The function `func_1` only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), and if the middle element (if n is odd) is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum elements. However, it does not check if the elements in the array can be arranged in a progressive square according to the rules specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input is:

3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

The program will output "NO", but it does not provide any explanation why. The correct output should be "NO" because the elements in the array cannot be arranged in a progressive square according to the rules.

A correct solution would involve generating the progressive square according to the rules and then checking if the elements in the array match the generated square.
