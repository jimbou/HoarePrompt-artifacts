Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Annotated Program:

for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l.
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns the string 'no'
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in `l`. The difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d).
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns the string 'NO'
        #State: *n is an odd integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c is an integer such that 1 <= c <= 10^6, d is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10^6, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, and r is an integer equal to (n^2)/2. The middle element of l is equal to half of a
    #State: *n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c is an integer such that 1 <= c <= 10^6, d is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10^6, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, and r is an integer equal to (n^2)/2. If n is odd, the middle element of l is equal to half of a. If n is even, there are no additional changes to the variables.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'

    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes', indicating that either the loop has returned 'no' or all elements in the sorted list `l` are equal to the first and last element of `l`, which is a list of n^2 integers where n is an integer between 2 and 500, and the integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of integers can be arranged in a specific pattern. It takes as input a list of n^2 integers, where n is an integer between 2 and 500, and the integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9. The function first checks if the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted list is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), where c and d are integers between 1 and 10^6. If not, it returns 'no'. If n is odd, it checks if the middle element of the list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. If not, it returns 'NO'. Then, it checks if all elements in the list are equal to the first and last element of the list. If any of these checks fail, it returns 'no'. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be arranged in the specified pattern.
