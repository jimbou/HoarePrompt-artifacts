Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given list of integers can be arranged in this pattern. 

The program first checks if the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted list is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), which is a necessary condition for the list to be arranged in a progressive square. 

If n is odd, it checks if the middle element of the list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements, which is another necessary condition. 

Finally, it checks if all elements in the list are equal to the first and last element of the list, which is also a necessary condition for the list to be arranged in a progressive square. 

If any of these checks fail, it returns 'no' or 'NO', indicating that the list cannot be arranged in the specified pattern. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be arranged in the specified pattern.

Correctness: **True**
