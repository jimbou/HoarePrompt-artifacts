This function determines whether a given list of integers can be arranged in a specific pattern. It takes as input a list of n^2 integers, where n is an integer between 2 and 500, and the integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9. The function first checks if the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted list is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), where c and d are integers between 1 and 10^6. If not, it returns 'no'. If n is odd, it checks if the middle element of the list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. If not, it returns 'NO'. Then, it checks if all elements in the list are equal to the first and last element of the list. If any of these checks fail, it returns 'no'. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be arranged in the specified pattern.
