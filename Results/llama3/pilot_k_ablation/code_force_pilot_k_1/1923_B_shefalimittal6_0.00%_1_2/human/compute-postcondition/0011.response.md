Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the values in `a` at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is `i`, `r` is `k`, stdin contains `n` input integers, `i` is 1, and `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`***
