The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop variable `_` is not initialized, so it needs to be adjusted to be 0 (the first value in the range).
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
