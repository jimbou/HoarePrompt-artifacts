A `ValueError` might be triggered at `t = int(input())`. If the input is not an integer, the `ValueError` is raised, and the program prints "Invalid input format". Otherwise, the program calls `func_1` `t` times. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `func_1` has been called `t` times if the input is a valid integer, otherwise, the program prints "Invalid input format" and the state is unknown.
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `func_1` has been called `t` times if the input is a valid integer, otherwise, the program prints "Invalid input format" and the state is unknown.**
