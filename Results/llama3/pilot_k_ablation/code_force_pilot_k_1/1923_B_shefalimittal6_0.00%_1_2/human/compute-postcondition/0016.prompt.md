You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, then a space-separated list of n integers, and finally a space-separated list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, the integers in the first list are positive integers, and the integers in the second list are non-zero integers.
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the sum of the values in a at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is i, stdin contains n input integers.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the values in `a` at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is `i`, `r` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `r` is `k` multiplied by the number of times the loop executes without printing 'NO' and then subtracting the sum of the values in `b` from index 1 to `n`, stdin contains `n` input integers.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: The program either prints 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the input values, or it prints 'Invalid input format' if the input format is invalid. The state of the program variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `r` is unknown if a `ValueError` occurs.

```

Return Postconditions: The program either prints 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the input values, or it prints 'Invalid input format' if the input format is invalid. The state of the program variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `r` is unknown if a `ValueError` occurs.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
