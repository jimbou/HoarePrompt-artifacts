Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the input values, or 'Invalid input format' if the input format is invalid. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given set of inputs meets certain conditions, and it performs calculations and comparisons to make this determination. The final state of the program is that it has printed one of the three possible outputs, and the state of the program variables is either defined based on the input values or unknown if a ValueError occurs.**
