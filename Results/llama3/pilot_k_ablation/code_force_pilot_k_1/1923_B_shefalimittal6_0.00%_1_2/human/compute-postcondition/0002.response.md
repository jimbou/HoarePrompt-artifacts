Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and a function named `func_1` has been called.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The code snippet only calls a function named `func_1`, which may or may not have side effects or return a value. However, since the function call is not assigned to a variable, any return value is discarded. The output state reflects that the function has been called, but does not provide any information about the function's behavior or return value.
