Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the values in `a` at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is `i`, `r` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `r` is `k` multiplied by the number of times the loop executes without printing 'NO' and then subtracting the sum of the values in `b` from index 1 to `n`, stdin contains `n` input integers.**
