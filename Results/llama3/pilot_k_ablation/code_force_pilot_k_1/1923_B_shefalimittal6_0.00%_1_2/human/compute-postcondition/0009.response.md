Output: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the values in `a` at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is `i`, `r` is `k`, stdin contains `n` input integers, `i` is 1. The current value of `r` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`, and 'NO' is printed**
