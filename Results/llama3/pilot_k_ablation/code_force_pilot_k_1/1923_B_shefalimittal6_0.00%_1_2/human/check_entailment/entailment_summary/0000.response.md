Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a character can survive and kill all monsters in a game without letting any of them reach the character. The game is modeled as a straight line, and the character is at point 0. Monsters have health and are initially at certain points on the line. The character can fire up to k bullets at monsters each second, and monsters move closer to the character each second.

Function `func_1` reads input for a single test case, processes it, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the character can survive and kill all monsters. It calculates the total health of monsters at each distance from the character and checks if the character can kill all monsters at each distance before they reach the character.

Function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program is correct if it meets the problem description, which it does. `func_1` correctly calculates the total health of monsters at each distance and checks if the character can kill all monsters before they reach the character. `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
