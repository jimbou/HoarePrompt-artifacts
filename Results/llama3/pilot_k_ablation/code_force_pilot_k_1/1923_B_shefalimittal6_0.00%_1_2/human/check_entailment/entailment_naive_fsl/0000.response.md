Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. In the given code, the input for the position of the monsters (x_i) is read only once for all monsters, whereas the problem description states that each monster has its own position. This means that the code is not correctly reading the input for the positions of the monsters.

A correct implementation should read the positions of the monsters separately for each monster, not just once for all monsters. 

Here is an example of how the correct implementation should look like:

```
def func_1():
    try:
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            b[abs(x[i])] += a[i]
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            r -= b[i]
        print('YES')
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input format')
```

In this corrected version, the positions of the monsters are read separately for each monster using the line `x = list(map(int, input().split()))`.
