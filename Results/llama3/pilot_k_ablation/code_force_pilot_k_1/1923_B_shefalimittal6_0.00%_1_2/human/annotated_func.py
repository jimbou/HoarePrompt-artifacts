#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, then a space-separated list of n integers, and finally a space-separated list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, the integers in the first list are positive integers, and the integers in the second list are non-zero integers.
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())

        #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the sum of the values in a at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is i, stdin contains n input integers.

        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the values in `a` at indices where the absolute value of the input integer is `i`, `r` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `r` is `k` multiplied by the number of times the loop executes without printing 'NO' and then subtracting the sum of the values in `b` from index 1 to `n`, stdin contains `n` input integers.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: The program either prints 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the input values, or it prints 'Invalid input format' if the input format is invalid. The state of the program variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `r` is unknown if a `ValueError` occurs.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the input values, or 'Invalid input format' if the input format is invalid. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given set of inputs meets certain conditions, and it performs calculations and comparisons to make this determination. The final state of the program is that it has printed one of the three possible outputs, and the state of the program variables is either defined based on the input values or unknown if a ValueError occurs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (t) greater than 0.
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `func_1` has been called `t` times.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `func_1` has been called `t` times if the input is a valid integer, otherwise, the program prints "Invalid input format" and the state is unknown.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer input from the user and attempts to call another function (`func_1`) a specified number of times based on the input value. If the input is a valid integer, the function calls `func_1` the specified number of times. If the input is not a valid integer, the function prints an error message ("Invalid input format") and does not call `func_1`.
