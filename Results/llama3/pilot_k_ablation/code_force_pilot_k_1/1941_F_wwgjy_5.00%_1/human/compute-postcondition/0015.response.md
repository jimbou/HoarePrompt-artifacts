Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing differences and corresponding values from `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer or 0, `res` is the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd` if `start` < `(f[j - 1] + b[i])` < `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` < `s` < `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
