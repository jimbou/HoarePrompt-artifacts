Output State: **The program has finished processing all test cases from stdin. The variables n, m, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, and res do not have specific values as they are reassigned in each iteration of the loop. The loop has printed the minimum difference between elements of a that can be achieved by adding an element from b and an element from f, or the smallest difference between elements of a if no such combination is found, for each test case.**
