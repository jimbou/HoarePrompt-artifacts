The code prints the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, which is a sorted list of tuples containing differences and corresponding values from the list `a`. Since the exact values in the `gap` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the first element of the first tuple. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest difference value from the list `a`.

Output: **the smallest difference value from the list a**
