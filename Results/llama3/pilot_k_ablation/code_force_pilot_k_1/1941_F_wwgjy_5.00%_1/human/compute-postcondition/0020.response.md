The code prints the first element of the `gap` list, which is a sorted list of tuples containing differences and corresponding elements from `a`. Since `gap` is sorted, the first element `gap[0][0]` represents the smallest difference between elements in `a`.

Output: **the smallest difference between elements in the list a**
