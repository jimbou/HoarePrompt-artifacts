Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing differences and corresponding elements from `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. The current value of `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`***
