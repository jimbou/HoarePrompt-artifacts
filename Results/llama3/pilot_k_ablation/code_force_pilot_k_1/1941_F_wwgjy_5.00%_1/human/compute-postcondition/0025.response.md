Postcondition: **The program prints the minimum of the initial res (inf) and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all s that satisfy start < s < end, where s is the sum of an element from b and an element from f, or the first element of the gap list which is the smallest difference between the elements of a if the current value of res is equal to inf.**
