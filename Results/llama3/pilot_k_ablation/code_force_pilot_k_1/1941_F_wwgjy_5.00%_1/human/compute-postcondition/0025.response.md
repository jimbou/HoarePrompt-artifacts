Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing differences and corresponding elements from `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values, `i` is `m`, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain` if `m` is greater than 0, otherwise `j` is undefined. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the `gap` list which is the smallest difference between elements in the list `a` is printed. Otherwise, `res` is printed.***
