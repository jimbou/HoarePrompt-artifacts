This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four lines of integers. It calculates and prints the minimum difference between elements of the first line that can be achieved by adding an element from the second line and an element from the third line, or the smallest difference between elements of the first line if no such combination is found. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each independently, and outputs the result for each case.
