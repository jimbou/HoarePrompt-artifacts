Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}). The third line contains m space-separated integers: d_1, d_2, ..., d_m (1 <= d_i <= 10^9). The fourth line contains k space-separated integers: f_1, f_2, ..., f_k (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).**
