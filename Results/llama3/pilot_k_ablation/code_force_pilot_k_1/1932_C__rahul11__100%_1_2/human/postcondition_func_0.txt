The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers (n and m), an array of n integers, and a string of n characters ('L' and 'R'). The function then performs a series of operations on the input data, including iterating through the string, updating indices, and calculating a product modulo m. Finally, it prints the result of these operations in reverse order. The function does not return any value, and its execution leaves the input variables undefined.
