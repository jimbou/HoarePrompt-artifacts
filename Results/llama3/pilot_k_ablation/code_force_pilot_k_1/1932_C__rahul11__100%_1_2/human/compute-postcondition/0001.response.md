Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, stdin is empty**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m. Then it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to arr. After that, it reads a string from stdin and assigns it to s. The last two lines initialize l to 0 and r to n - 1. Since stdin initially contains an integer t that must be at least 1, after the code executes, stdin is empty.
