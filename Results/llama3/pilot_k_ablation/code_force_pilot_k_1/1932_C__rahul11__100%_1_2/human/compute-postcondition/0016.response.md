Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must not be empty, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `p`, `p` is either 1 times `arr[r]` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', `r` is either `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1 if the last character of `s` is 'R', or undefined if the last character of `s` is not 'R', `l` is either undefined if the last character of `s` is 'R', or one less than the number of 'L' characters in `s` if the last character of `s` is not 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `p`. The value of `p` depends on the last character of the string `s`. If the last character is 'R', then `p` is calculated as 1 times the element at index `r` in `arr`, modulo `m`, where `r` is calculated based on the number of 'R' characters in `s`. If the last character is not 'R', then `p` is calculated as the product of the original `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m`, where `l` is calculated based on the number of 'L' characters in `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged.
