The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order.

Since `ans` is a list containing the product of the original `p` and the elements at indices `l` and `r` in `arr`, modulo `m`, for each character in `s`, and `s` is an empty string, the `ans` list is also empty.

Therefore, the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print nothing, as there are no elements in the `ans` list to print.

Output: **(nothing)**
