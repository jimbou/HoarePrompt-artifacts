Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin is empty, s is a string that must not be empty. If the last character of the string s is 'R', then r is n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in s plus 1, and p is 1 times arr[r] modulo m. Otherwise, l is one less than the number of 'L' characters in s, and p is the product of the original p and the element at index l in arr, modulo m. In both cases, ans is an empty list.***
