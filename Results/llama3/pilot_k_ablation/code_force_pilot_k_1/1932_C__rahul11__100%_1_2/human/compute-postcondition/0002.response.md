To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is the first character in `s`**
