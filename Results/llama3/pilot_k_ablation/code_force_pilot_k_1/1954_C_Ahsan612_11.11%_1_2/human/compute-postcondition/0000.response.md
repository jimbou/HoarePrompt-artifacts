The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9. The strings on each pair of lines have the same length. So for the loop to be executed  the expression `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9. The strings on each pair of lines have the same length,  `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
