Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes pairs of strings of digits, and prints two strings for each pair. The first string contains the maximum digit from each corresponding pair of digits in the input strings, and the second string contains the minimum digit from each corresponding pair of digits in the input strings. The function repeats this process for a number of pairs specified by the first integer input, leaving stdin empty after execution.**
