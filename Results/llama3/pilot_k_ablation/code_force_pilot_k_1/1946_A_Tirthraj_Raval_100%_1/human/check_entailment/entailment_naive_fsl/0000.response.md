Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
2. It then calculates the index `p` of the median element. Since the median is the middle element in the sorted array, `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.
3. The program then counts the number of elements in the array that are equal to the median element `a[p]`. This is done using the `count` method, which returns the number of occurrences of `a[p]` in the slice `a[p:]`.
4. The result is printed as the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program works correctly for all cases because:

* If the median is unique, increasing it by 1 will require only 1 operation.
* If the median is repeated, increasing it by 1 will require as many operations as there are repetitions of the median.
* The program correctly handles arrays of odd and even lengths.
* The program correctly handles arrays with distinct and non-distinct elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
