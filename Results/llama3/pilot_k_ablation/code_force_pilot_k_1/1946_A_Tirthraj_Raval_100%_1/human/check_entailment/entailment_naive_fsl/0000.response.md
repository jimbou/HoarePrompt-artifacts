Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
2. It then calculates the index `p` of the median element using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This formula correctly calculates the index of the median element, whether the array has an odd or even number of elements.
3. The program then counts the number of elements in the array that are equal to the median element using the `count` method. This gives the number of elements that need to be increased to increase the median.
4. Finally, the program prints the result.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Arrays with an odd number of elements, where the median is the middle element.
* Arrays with an even number of elements, where the median is the average of the two middle elements.
* Arrays with duplicate elements, where the median is the middle element (or the average of the two middle elements) of the sorted array.
* Arrays with a single element, where the median is the only element.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
