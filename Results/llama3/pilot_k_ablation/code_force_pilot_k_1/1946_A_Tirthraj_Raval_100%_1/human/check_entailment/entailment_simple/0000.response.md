Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the index of the median. The median is the middle value in the sorted array, which is the value at index `p` where `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. The program then counts the number of occurrences of the median value in the sorted array from index `p` to the end. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program's logic is correct because increasing the median value by 1 will require incrementing all occurrences of the median value in the array. The program correctly identifies the median value and counts its occurrences, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **True**
