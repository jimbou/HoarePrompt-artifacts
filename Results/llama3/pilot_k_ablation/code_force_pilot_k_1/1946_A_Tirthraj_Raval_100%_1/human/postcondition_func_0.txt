The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It sorts the list of integers and finds the count of the median value (the middle value in the sorted list). The function then prints the count of the median value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
