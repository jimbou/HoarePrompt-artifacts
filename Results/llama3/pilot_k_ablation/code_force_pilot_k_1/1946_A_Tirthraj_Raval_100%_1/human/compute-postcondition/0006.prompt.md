You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^5. The integers in the list are positive integers and do not exceed 10^9.
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        res = a[p:].count(a[p])
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t is 0, _ is t, n is the last integer input, a is the last sorted list of integers, p is the last integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 - 1, res is the last integer equal to the count of the median value in the sorted list a, and the count of the median value in the sorted list a which is equal to res has been printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, _ is t, n is the last integer input, a is the last sorted list of integers, p is the last integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 - 1, res is the last integer equal to the count of the median value in the sorted list a, and the count of the median value in the sorted list a which is equal to res has been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
