The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is not defined before this line, it now holds the value of the first input from stdin. The value of `t` is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^5. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case containing two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **t is a positive integer not exceeding 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case containing two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers.**
