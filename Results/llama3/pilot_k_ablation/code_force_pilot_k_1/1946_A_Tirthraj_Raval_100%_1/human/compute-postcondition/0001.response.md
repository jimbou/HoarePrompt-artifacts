To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^5, which does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
