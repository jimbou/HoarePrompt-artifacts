Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the input X = 3. The program outputs an array with 2 elements: [0, 0], but this array has only 3 increasing subsequences: [], [0], and [0, 0]. However, the problem statement requires an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, which in this case is 3. The correct output for X = 3 should be an array with 3 elements, such as [0, 1, 0].

The issue with the program is that it only considers adding elements to the beginning of the array, and it does not consider adding elements to the end of the array. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.
