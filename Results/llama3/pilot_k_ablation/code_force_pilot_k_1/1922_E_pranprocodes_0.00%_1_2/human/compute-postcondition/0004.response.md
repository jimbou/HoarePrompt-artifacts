Output State: **i is 0, x is an integer equal to half of its original value, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a string containing the original value of max followed by a space, t is 0, stdin contains at least one less integer input.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the string representation of the original value of `max` followed by a space to `ans`. The second line decrements `max` by 1, making it 99999999. The third line performs integer division of `x` by 2, effectively halving its value. Since `x` was originally an even integer, the result is an integer. The values of `i`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged. The number of integer inputs in `stdin` is not affected by the code.
