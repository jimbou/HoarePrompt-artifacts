Output State: **i is 0, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0, stdin contains at least one less integer input**.

The code block reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variables `max` and `min` are assigned large positive and negative integer values, respectively. The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty string, and `t` is set to 0. Since stdin initially contained at least one integer input, after reading one integer, it will contain at least one less integer input.
