Output State: **`i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the while loop executed in the last iteration, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order, with the values of `max` decreasing by 1 and the values of `min` increasing by 1, `max` is the original value of `max` minus the total number of times `x` was even in all iterations, `min` is the original value of `min` plus the total number of times `x` was odd in all iterations. If the initial value of `t` is 0, the loop does not execute and `i` is 0, `x` is not defined, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains the initial two inputs, `ans` is an empty string, `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -100000000.**
