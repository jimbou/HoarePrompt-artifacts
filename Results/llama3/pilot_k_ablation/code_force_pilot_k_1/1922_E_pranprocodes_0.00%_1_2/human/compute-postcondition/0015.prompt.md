You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer X (2 <= X <= 10^18).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = ''
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the while loop executed in the last iteration, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order, with the values of `max` decreasing by 1 and the values of `min` increasing by 1, `max` is the original value of `max` minus the total number of times `x` was even in all iterations, `min` is the original value of `min` plus the total number of times `x` was odd in all iterations. If the initial value of `t` is 0, the loop does not execute and `i` is 0, `x` is not defined, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains the initial two inputs, `ans` is an empty string, `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -100000000.

```

Return Postconditions: `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the while loop executed in the last iteration, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order, with the values of `max` decreasing by 1 and the values of `min` increasing by 1, `max` is the original value of `max` minus the total number of times `x` was even in all iterations, `min` is the original value of `min` plus the total number of times `x` was odd in all iterations. If the initial value of `t` is 0, the loop does not execute and `i` is 0, `x` is not defined, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains the initial two inputs, `ans` is an empty string, `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -100000000.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
