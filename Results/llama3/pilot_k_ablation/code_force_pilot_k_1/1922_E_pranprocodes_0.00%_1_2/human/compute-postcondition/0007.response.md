Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is a string containing the original value of `max` followed by a space. If `x` is odd, `ans` is '-100000000 ', `min` is -99999999, and `max` is 100000000.***
