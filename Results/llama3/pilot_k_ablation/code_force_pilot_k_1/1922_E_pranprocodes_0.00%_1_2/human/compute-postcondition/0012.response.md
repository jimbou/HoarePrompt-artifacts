The code prints the values of `max` and `min` in alternating order, with the values of `max` decreasing by 1 and the values of `min` increasing by 1, where `max` is the original value of `max` minus the number of times `x` was even, and `min` is the original value of `min` plus the number of times `x` was odd.

Output: **the values of max and min in alternating order, with the values of max decreasing by 1 and the values of min increasing by 1, where max is the original value of max minus the number of times x was even, and min is the original value of min plus the number of times x was odd**
