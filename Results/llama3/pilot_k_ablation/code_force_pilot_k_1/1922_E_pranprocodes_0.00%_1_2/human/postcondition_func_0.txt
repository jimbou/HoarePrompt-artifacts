This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers to process. For each integer X, it generates a sequence of alternating maximum and minimum values, starting from 100000000 and -100000000 respectively, and decreasing/increasing by 1 for each iteration. The sequence is constructed by repeatedly dividing X by 2 if it's even, or subtracting 1 if it's odd, until X becomes 1. The function then prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. If the initial value of t is 0, the function does not process any integers and leaves the input unchanged.
