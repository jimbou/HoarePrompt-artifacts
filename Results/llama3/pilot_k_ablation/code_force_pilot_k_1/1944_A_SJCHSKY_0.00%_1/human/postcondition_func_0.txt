This function reads a series of queries from standard input, where each query consists of two integers n and k. For each query, it calculates the largest integer reachable_count such that k is greater than or equal to the sum of reachable_count-1 and all previous reachable counts. The function then prints the calculated reachable_count for each query, effectively determining the maximum reachable count for each input pair (n, k).
