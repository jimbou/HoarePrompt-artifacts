The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of nodes that can be reached in a graph with n nodes and k edges, for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates, having printed the results for all test cases.
