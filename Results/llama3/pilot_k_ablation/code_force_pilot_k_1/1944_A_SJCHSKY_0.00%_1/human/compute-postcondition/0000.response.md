Output State: **`qs` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n*(n-1)/2), and there are qs-1 more lines of input.**

In this output state, the variable `qs` is assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^3. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining lines of input are still present, with the first line containing two integers n and k, where n is between 1 and 100, and k is between 0 and n*(n-1)/2. There are qs-1 more lines of input remaining.
