Output State: **`qs` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.**

In this output state, `qs` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the remaining test cases still contain two integers n and k within the specified ranges.
