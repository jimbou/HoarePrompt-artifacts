Output State: **qs is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2, reachable_count is an integer equal to n, stdin contains qs-1 lines of input, _ is 0**

The code first reads two integers from the first line of stdin, assigning them to `n` and `k`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, and the value of `k` is between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`. The second line assigns the value of `n` to `reachable_count`. The value of `qs` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains `qs-1` lines of input, as the first line has been read.
