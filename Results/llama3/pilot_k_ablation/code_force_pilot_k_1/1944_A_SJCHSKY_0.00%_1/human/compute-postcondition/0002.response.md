Output State: **qs is at least 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, reachable_count is equal to n**

The code block reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `k`, and then assigns the value of `n` to `reachable_count`. The value of `qs` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The input is consumed by the first line, so it is empty after the code execution.
