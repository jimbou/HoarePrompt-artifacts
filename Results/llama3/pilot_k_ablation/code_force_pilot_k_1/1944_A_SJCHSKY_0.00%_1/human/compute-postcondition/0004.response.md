The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line subtracts the value of `reachable_count - 1` from `k`. Since `reachable_count` is initially equal to `n`, this means `k` is decremented by `n - 1`. The second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1.

Output State: **qs is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, k is an integer between -n+1 and n*(n-1)/2, reachable_count is an integer equal to n-1, stdin contains qs-1 lines of input, _ is 0**
