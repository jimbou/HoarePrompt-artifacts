To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `qs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `qs`. If `qs` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `qs` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `qs` must be at least 1.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means it's not used anywhere in the loop body. Therefore, we don't need to adjust its state.

State: **`qs` is at least 1**
