The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `qs`. If `qs` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `qs` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n*(n-1)/2), and there are qs-1 more lines of input. So for the loop to be executed  `qs` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`qs` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n*(n-1)/2), and there are qs-1 more lines of input, `_` is 0**
