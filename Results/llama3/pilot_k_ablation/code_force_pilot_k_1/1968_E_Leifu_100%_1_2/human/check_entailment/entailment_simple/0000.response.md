Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases (t) and the size of the grid (n) as inputs.

The program first prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case. This is a valid starting point, as these two points have a Manhattan distance of 1.

For n = 3, the program prints the coordinate (2, 3), which has a Manhattan distance of 2 with (1, 1) and a Manhattan distance of 1 with (1, 2). This is a valid solution for n = 3.

For n >= 4, the program prints the coordinate (2, 4), which has a Manhattan distance of 3 with (1, 1) and a Manhattan distance of 2 with (1, 2). Then, it prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n. These points have Manhattan distances of j - 1 with (1, 1) and j - 2 with (1, 2). This is a valid solution for n >= 4.

The program correctly handles all possible values of n and prints the coordinates that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
