Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 6, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
5 5
6 6

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of H. A correct arrangement for n = 6 would be:

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1

This arrangement produces a larger set H with more distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
