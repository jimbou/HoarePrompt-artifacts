Reasoning:

The problem asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program attempts to solve this problem by printing out a set of points that supposedly maximize the size of this set.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the program does not actually solve the problem correctly. For example, when n = 3, the program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3). However, the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (2, 3) is 4, which is not included in the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Similarly, when n = 4, the program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 4). However, the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (4, 4) is 6, which is not included in the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

In fact, the program does not even attempt to calculate the Manhattan distances between the points it prints out. It simply prints out a set of points that it hopes will maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
