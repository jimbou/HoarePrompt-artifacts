Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program's approach is to print a specific sequence of pairs of numbers for each test case, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', and then either '2 3' if n is 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs of numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) if n is 4 or greater.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program's approach is not correct for all values of n. Specifically, the program's output for n = 5 and n = 6 does not match the expected output provided in the problem description.

For example, when n = 5, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
2 4
5 5

However, the expected output for n = 5 is:

1 1
1 3
1 4
2 1
5 5

Similarly, when n = 6, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
2 4
6 6

However, the expected output for n = 6 is:

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1

Therefore, the program's approach is not correct for all values of n, and it does not produce the expected output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
