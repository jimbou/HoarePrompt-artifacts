Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), which is the first input from the stdin. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-1 inputs, which are the remaining t-1 integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3).
