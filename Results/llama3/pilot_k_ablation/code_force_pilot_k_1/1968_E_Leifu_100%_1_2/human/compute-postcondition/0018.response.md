Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3), '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and all numbers from 4 to `n` have been printed with themselves as "number number".***
