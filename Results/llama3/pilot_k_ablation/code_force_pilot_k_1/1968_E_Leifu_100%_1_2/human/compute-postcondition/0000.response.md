Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin is a list of t integers n, where each n is between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).
