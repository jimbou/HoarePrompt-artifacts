The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and n. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum divisor of x such that x minus n times the divisor is divisible by the divisor. The function processes all test cases and produces the corresponding output, leaving the standard input empty.
