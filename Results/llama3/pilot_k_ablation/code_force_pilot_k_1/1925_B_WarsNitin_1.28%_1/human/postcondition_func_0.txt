This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers x and n. For each case, it calculates and prints the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is divisible by i or x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i. If no such divisor exists, it prints 1. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
