The code prints the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is divisible by `i` or `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, if such a divisor exists, otherwise it prints 1.
Output: **the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is divisible by i or x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i, if such a divisor exists, otherwise 1**
