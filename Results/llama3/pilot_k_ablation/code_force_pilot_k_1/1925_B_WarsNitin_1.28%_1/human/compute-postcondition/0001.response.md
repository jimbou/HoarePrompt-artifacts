Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 0**

The code first reads two integers from stdin, assigning the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `n`. Since stdin initially contains an integer `t` followed by `t` lines of two integers, after reading the first line, `t-1` lines remain in stdin. The values of `x` and `n` are within their specified ranges. The second line initializes `ans` to 1. The value of `q` remains unchanged at 0.
