Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0 such that `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is `max(1, x // i)`, `q` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if part. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the divisibility of `x` by `i`, the relationship between `x` and `n` times `i`, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` are still valid.
