Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0 such that `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `stdin` is empty. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, and `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is `max(1, x // i)`, `q` is 0, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, `q` is 0, and `i` is 1.***
