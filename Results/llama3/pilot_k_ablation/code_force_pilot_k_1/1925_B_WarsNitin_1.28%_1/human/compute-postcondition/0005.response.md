The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `ans` is initially 1 and `i` is 1, the value of `ans` remains 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0 such that `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0.**
