The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is divisible by `i` or `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, if such a divisor exists, otherwise `ans` is 1.
Output: ** `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `stdin` is empty, `q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is divisible by `i` or `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, if such a divisor exists, otherwise `ans` is 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed**
