To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be greater than 1.
2. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0, `sqrt(x)` will be a real number greater than or equal to 1 (since the square root of any positive number is at least 1).
3. However, `int(sqrt(x))` will truncate the decimal part, so `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
4. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to ensure that `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:


State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0 such that `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
