Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the two integers `x` and `n` and initializes the answer `ans` to 1.
3. The program then iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is an optimization to reduce the number of iterations.
4. For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
	* If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
	* If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
5. After iterating over all divisors, the program prints the maximum divisor `ans` that satisfies the conditions.
6. The program correctly handles the case where `x` is 1, in which case the only possible divisor is 1.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem statement. The use of the square root optimization reduces the number of iterations, making the program more efficient.
