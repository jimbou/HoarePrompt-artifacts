x is a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a list of integers [n, q], where n is the number of operations and q is the number of queries. The next n integers represent the operations, where each operation is a list of two integers [b, x], where b is the type of operation and x is the value associated with the operation. The next q integers represent the queries.
