#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a list of integers [n, q], where n is the number of operations and q is the number of queries. The next n integers represent the operations, where each operation is a list of two integers [b, x], where b is the type of operation and x is the value associated with the operation. The next q integers represent the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases.
    #State: *`x` is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. `f` is not equal to 0
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is the remainder of the first integer of the list of integers divided by all the divisors in the list `a` that are less than the first integer, `f` is not equal to 0, `i` is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and performs operations based on the type of operation and value associated with each operation. If the first integer is equal to 0, it returns the value at index x in list b. Otherwise, it iterates through the list of operations in reverse order, updating the value of x by taking the remainder of x divided by the divisors in the list a that are less than the first integer. The function returns the value at index x in list b after all operations have been performed.
