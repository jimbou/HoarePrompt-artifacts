Postcondition: ***`x` is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases, and the rest of the list remains unchanged, `f` is at least 1, `i` is `f - 1`. If the current value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`, then `x` is the remainder of the first integer of the list of integers divided by `a[2 * i + 1]`, and `x` is not equal to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x`.***
