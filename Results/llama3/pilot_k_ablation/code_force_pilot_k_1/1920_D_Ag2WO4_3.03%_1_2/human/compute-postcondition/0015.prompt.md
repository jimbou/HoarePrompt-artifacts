You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a list of integers [n, q], where n is the number of operations and q is the number of queries. The next n integers represent the operations, where each operation is a list of two integers [b, x], where b is the type of operation and x is the value associated with the operation. The next q integers represent the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases.
    #State: *`x` is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. `f` is not equal to 0
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is the remainder of the first integer of the list of integers divided by all the divisors in the list `a` that are less than the first integer, `f` is not equal to 0, `i` is -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases.

Case_2: `x` is the remainder of the first integer of the list of integers divided by all the divisors in the list `a` that are less than the first integer, `f` is not equal to 0, `i` is -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
