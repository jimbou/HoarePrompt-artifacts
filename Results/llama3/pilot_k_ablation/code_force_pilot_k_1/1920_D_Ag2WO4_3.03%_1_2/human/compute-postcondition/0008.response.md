Postcondition: **`x` is the first integer of the list of integers, which is the number of test cases, and the rest of the list remains unchanged, `f` is at least 1, `i` is `f - 1`. If the current value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the code continues to execute. The current value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`.**
