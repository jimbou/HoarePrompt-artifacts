This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and performs operations based on the type of operation and value associated with each operation. If the first integer is equal to 0, it returns the value at index x in list b. Otherwise, it iterates through the list of operations in reverse order, updating the value of x by taking the remainder of x divided by the divisors in the list a that are less than the first integer. The function returns the value at index x in list b after all operations have been performed.
