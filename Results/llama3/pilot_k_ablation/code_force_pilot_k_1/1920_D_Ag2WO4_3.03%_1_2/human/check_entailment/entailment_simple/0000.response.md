Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the operations on the array and answers the queries.

The program maintains a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation. It also maintains a dictionary `b` to store the values appended to the array.

For each query, the program checks if the query index is within the range of the array size after each operation. If it is, it returns the value at that index. If not, it calculates the remainder of the query index divided by the array size after each operation and repeats the process until it finds the correct index.

The program also handles the case where the array size does not change after an operation (i.e., when `a[-1] - a[-2]` is 0) by updating the previous array size instead of appending a new size.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
