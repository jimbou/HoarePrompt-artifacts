Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operations described in the problem statement and handles the queries as required.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes an array `a` with two elements, both set to 0. This array is used to keep track of the size of the array after each operation.

2. The program then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

3. It then iterates over each operation. If the operation is of type 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of array `a` by 1 and stores the appended integer in a dictionary `b` with the current size of the array as the key.

4. If the operation is of type 2 (append x copies of the array), it checks if the current size of the array is not equal to the size of the array before the last operation. If it's not equal, it appends the current size of the array to array `a`, multiplies the last element of array `a` by `x + 1`, and appends the result to array `a`. It also increments a counter `f` to keep track of the number of type 2 operations.

5. If the current size of the array is equal to the size of the array before the last operation, it simply multiplies the second last element of array `a` by `x + 1` and updates the last element of array `a`.

6. After all operations have been processed, the program reads the queries.

7. For each query, it checks if the counter `f` is 0. If it is, it simply returns the value stored in dictionary `b` at the index equal to the query.

8. If `f` is not 0, it iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each pair of elements in array `a`, it checks if the first element is greater than or equal to the query. If it is, it continues to the next pair.

9. If the second element of the pair is less than the query, it takes the remainder of the query divided by the second element and updates the query. If the remainder is 0, it returns the value stored in dictionary `b` at the index equal to the second element.

10. If the first element of the pair is greater than or equal to the updated query, it continues to the next pair.

11. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns the value stored in dictionary `b` at the index equal to the query.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the correct values for the queries.

Correctness: **True**
