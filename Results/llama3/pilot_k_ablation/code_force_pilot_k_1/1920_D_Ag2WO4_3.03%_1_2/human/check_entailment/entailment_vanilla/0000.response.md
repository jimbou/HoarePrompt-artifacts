Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array a after a series of operations. The operations can either append an integer x to the end of the array or append x copies of the array to the end of the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  Initialization: The program initializes an array a with two elements, both set to 0. It also initializes an empty dictionary b and two variables c and d to store the number of operations and queries, respectively.

2.  Reading Operations: The program reads the operations and queries from the input. For each operation, it checks if the operation type is 1 (append an integer) or 2 (append copies of the array). If the operation type is 1, it appends the integer to the dictionary b with the current index as the key. If the operation type is 2, it updates the array a by multiplying the last element by the number of copies plus one.

3.  Handling Queries: The program reads the queries and applies a function (func_1) to each query. The function takes the query index x as input and returns the k-th element of the array a.

4.  Function func_1: This function works by iterating through the array a in reverse order. If the current index is within the range of the array a, it returns the corresponding value from the dictionary b. If the current index is not within the range, it calculates the remainder of the index divided by the length of the array a and recursively applies the function to the remainder.

5.  Output: The program prints the results of the queries as a string without commas.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, the program correctly handles the operations and queries. It correctly updates the array a and dictionary b according to the operations and returns the k-th element of the array a for each query.

Correctness: **True**
