Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of array a after a series of operations. The program uses a list a to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary b to store the values appended to the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and the number of queries. It then reads the operations and queries, and performs the operations on the array.

The function func_1 is used to find the k-th element of the array after all operations have been performed. It takes an integer x as input, which represents the index of the element to be found. If the number of operations is 0, it simply returns the value at index x in list b. Otherwise, it iterates through the list of operations in reverse order, updating the value of x by taking the remainder of x divided by the divisors in the list a that are less than the first integer.

The program then prints the k-th element of the array for each query.

Correctness: **True**
