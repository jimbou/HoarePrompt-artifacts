This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four lines of input: three integers n, m, and k, followed by n integers, m integers, and k integers. It calculates the minimum maximum gap between the sum of an element from the m integers and an element from the k integers, and the difference between consecutive elements in the n integers, or the difference between the first two consecutive elements in the n integers if no such sum is found. The function prints the result for each test case.
