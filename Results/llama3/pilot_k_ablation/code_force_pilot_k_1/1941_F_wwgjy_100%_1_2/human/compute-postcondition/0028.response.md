Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `m`. If `res` is still `inf`, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all possible values of `s` that can be formed by adding an element from `b` to an element from `f` such that `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, and the value of `res` is being printed.***
