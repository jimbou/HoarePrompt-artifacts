Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer at least 1, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is either inf or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (which was infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Since `s` is between `start` and `end` but not equal to either, `end - s` and `s - start` are both positive. Therefore, the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` is either `end - s`, `s - start`, or `nd`, whichever is largest. The value of `res` is now either still infinity (if the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` is still greater than infinity) or the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. All other variables remain unchanged.
