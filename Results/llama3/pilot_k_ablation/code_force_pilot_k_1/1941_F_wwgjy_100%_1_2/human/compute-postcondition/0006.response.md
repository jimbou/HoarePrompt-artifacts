Postcondition: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer at least 1, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is still inf, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. The current value of `s` is between `start` and `end`, but not equal to either.**
