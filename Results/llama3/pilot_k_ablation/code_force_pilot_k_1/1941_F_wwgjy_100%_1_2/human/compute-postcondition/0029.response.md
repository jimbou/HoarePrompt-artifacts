Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `_` is the number of test cases, `res` is either the minimum of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all possible values of `s` that can be formed by adding an element from `b` to an element from `f` such that `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, or the difference between the first two consecutive elements in `a` if `res` is still `inf`, `i` is `m` times the number of test cases.**
