Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is either still inf or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is at least 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then the current value of `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and the value of `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`, if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. All other variables remain unchanged.
