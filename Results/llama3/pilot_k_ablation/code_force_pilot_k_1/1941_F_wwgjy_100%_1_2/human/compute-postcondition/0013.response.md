Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is either still inf or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j] + b[0]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
