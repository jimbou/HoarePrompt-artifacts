Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, with a maximum of m tickets purchasable each day. The prices per ticket for each day are given in the list a.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum spending by sorting the prices in ascending order and then buying as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest prices. This approach ensures that the minimum amount of money is spent to purchase k tickets.

However, there is a flaw in the implementation. The function sorts the prices in ascending order, but it does not take into account the fact that the prices increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day. This means that the function is not correctly simulating the process of buying tickets and updating the prices.

For example, in the first test case, the prices are [8, 6, 4, 2]. If we buy 2 tickets on the first day, the prices for the remaining days should be [10, 8, 6], not [6, 4, 2]. This is because the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

Therefore, the function is not correctly solving the problem.

Function 2, `func_2`, handles input and output for multiple test cases, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **False**
