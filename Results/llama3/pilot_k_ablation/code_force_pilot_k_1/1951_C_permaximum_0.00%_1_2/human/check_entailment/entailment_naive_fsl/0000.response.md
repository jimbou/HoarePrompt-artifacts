Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem states that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. However, the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and buys the tickets at the lowest prices without considering the price increase.

For example, consider the input:

3 2 4
1 2 3

The program will buy 2 tickets on the first day at a price of 1, and then buy 2 tickets on the second day at a price of 2. However, according to the problem description, the price on the second day should be increased by 2 (the number of tickets bought on the first day), so the correct price on the second day should be 4. The program does not account for this price increase, and therefore does not correctly calculate the minimum spending.

A correct implementation would need to take into account the price increase caused by buying tickets on previous days.
