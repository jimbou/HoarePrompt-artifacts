Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given a list of daily ticket prices and a maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. It sorts the prices in ascending order and then iteratively buys the maximum allowable tickets at the lowest available price until it reaches the target number of tickets. This approach ensures that the minimum amount of money is spent to purchase k tickets.

Function 2, `func_2`, handles input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three positive integers (n, m, k) and a list of n positive integers (prices), calls the `func_1` function with these inputs, and prints the result.

However, there is a flaw in the program. The problem statement mentions that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. But the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and buys the maximum allowable tickets at the lowest available price without considering the price increase.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
