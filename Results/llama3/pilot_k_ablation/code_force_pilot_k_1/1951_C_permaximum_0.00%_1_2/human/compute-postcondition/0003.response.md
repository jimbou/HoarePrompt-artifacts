The code prints the value of `result` which is the output of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function `func_1` with the given inputs.

Output: **result (where result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
