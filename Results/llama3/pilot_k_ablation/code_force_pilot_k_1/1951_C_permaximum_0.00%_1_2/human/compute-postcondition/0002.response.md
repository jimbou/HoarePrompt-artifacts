Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-2 inputs, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and k are updated to the positive integers read from the first line of stdin. The list prices is updated to contain n positive integers read from the second line of stdin. The variable result is assigned the output of the function func_1, which takes n, m, k, and prices as arguments. The stdin now contains t-2 inputs, as two lines have been read. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0.
