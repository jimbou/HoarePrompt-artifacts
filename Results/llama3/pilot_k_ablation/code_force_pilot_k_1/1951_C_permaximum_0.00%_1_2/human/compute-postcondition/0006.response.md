Functionality: **Handles input and output for multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three positive integers (n, m, k) and a list of n positive integers (prices), calls the func_1 function with these inputs, and prints the result. After all test cases have been processed, the function concludes with the results of func_1 printed for each test case.**
