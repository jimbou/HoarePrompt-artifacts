According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is at least 1. However, we need to adjust the state of `_` (the loop variable) to indicate that it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution.


State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, `t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `_` is 0**
