Functionality: This function calculates the minimum amount of money needed to purchase a specified number of tickets (k) at the lowest prices available over a certain number of days (n), with a daily limit on the number of tickets that can be bought (m). It sorts the prices of tickets for each day in ascending order and then iteratively buys the maximum allowable tickets at the lowest prices until it reaches the target number of tickets (k), keeping track of the total cost. The function returns this total cost, which represents the minimum spending required to purchase k tickets.
