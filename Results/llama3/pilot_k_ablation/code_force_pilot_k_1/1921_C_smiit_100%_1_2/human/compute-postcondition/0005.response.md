Postcondition: **t is at least 1, n is greater than 0, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), possible is True, stdin contains no input, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second element of arr and the first element of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.**
