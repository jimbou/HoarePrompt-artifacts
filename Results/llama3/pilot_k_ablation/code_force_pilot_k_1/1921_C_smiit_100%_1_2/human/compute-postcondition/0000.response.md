Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in strictly increasing order.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a positive integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin, each containing two lines of input as described in the initial state.
