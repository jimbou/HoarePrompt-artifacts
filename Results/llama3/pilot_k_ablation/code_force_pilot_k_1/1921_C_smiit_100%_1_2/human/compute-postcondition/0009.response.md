Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for each iteration, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for any iteration, otherwise `possible` is True, `i` is `n` if the loop executes, otherwise `i` is not defined.**
