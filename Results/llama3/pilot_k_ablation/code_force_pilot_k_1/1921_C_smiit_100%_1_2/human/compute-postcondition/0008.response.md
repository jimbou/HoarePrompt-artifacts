Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), `i` is 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the second element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. If the current value of `f` minus `energy_cost` is less than or equal to 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no change is made to the value of `possible`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum energy cost, which is the minimum of the energy cost to keep it on (`a` times the time difference) and the energy cost to turn it off and on (`b`). The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `possible` is updated based on the new value of `f`.
