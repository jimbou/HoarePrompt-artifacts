Based on the precondition, the value of `possible` is determined by the value of `f` and the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for each iteration.

If `f` is less than or equal to the sum of the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for any iteration, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` is True.

Since `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), the value of `possible` depends on the specific values of these variables.

However, without knowing the exact values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`, we cannot determine the exact value of `possible`.

Therefore, the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the value of `possible`.

Output: **YES if possible is True, otherwise NO**
