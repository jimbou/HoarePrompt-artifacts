Output State: **t is at least 1, n is greater than 0, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers with at least one element (the first element is 0), possible is False, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second element of arr and the first element of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.**

The code snippet modifies the value of `possible` to `False` and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the loop or the execution of the code block. Since `break` does not affect any variables, the state of all other variables remains unchanged.
