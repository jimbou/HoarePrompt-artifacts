To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it's already greater than 0, so we can adjust the state to reflect that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1**
