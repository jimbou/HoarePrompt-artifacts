Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to keep a device on for a series of time intervals, given the initial energy level and the energy costs of keeping the device on versus turning it off and on again. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b) representing the number of time intervals, the initial energy level, and the energy costs of keeping the device on and turning it off/on, respectively. The second line contains n positive integers representing the time intervals. The function then calculates the minimum energy cost for each interval and checks if the device can be kept on for all intervals without running out of energy. If possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
