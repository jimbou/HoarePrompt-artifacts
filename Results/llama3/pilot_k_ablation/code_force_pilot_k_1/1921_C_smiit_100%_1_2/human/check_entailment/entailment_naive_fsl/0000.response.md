Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through each message, calculates the energy cost of keeping the phone on and turning it off and on, and chooses the minimum energy cost. If the remaining energy is less than or equal to the energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the energy cost of keeping the phone on is less than or equal to the energy cost of turning it off and on, and where the remaining energy is less than or equal to the energy cost. It also handles the case where the input values are large, as shown in the sixth test set of the example.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
