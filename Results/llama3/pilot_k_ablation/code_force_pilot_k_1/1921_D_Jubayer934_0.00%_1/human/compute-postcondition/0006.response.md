Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
