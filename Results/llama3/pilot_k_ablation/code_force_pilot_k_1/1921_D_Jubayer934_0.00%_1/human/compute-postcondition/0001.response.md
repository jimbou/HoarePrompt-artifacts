To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), we can conclude that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i`. Since the loop starts from 0, we can set `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and the third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), and the first integer of the first line has been read and assigned to `n`.**
