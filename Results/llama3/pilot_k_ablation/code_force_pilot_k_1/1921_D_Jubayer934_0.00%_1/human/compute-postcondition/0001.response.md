The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 0**
