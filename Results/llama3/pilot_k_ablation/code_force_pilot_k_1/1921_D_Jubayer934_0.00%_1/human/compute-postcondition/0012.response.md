The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively.
Since `a` and `b` are empty lists, they do not contain any elements, and therefore, they do not have maximum or minimum values.
Output: **0 (which is the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively)**
