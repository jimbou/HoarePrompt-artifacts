The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum values in `a` and the minimum values in `b` for each iteration of the loop.
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(result)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum values in `a` and the minimum values in `b` for each iteration of the loop.
Output: **sum of absolute differences between max(a) and min(b) for each iteration (where a and b are lists of integers with lengths decreased by the minimum of m and n)**
