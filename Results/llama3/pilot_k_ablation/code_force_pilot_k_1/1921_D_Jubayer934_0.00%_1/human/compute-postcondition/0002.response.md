Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line each.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` has been updated to be half of its original value, which is still an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `m` has been assigned an integer value from the input. The list `a` contains `m` integers, and the list `b` contains `n` integers, which are sorted in ascending order. The list `result` is empty. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has only one line left.
