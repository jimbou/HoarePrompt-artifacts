Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 divided by 2, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `result`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
