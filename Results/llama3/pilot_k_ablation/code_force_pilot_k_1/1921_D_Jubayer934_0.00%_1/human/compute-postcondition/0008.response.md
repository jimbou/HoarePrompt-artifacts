Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 divided by 2 minus the difference between the initial lengths of `a` and `b`, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n - the difference between the initial lengths of `a` and `b` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is the difference between the initial lengths of `a` and `b`. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 divided by 2 minus the difference between the initial lengths of `a` and `b`, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n - the difference between the initial lengths of `a` and `b` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is the difference between the initial lengths of `a` and `b`. If the length of `a` is not equal to the length of `b`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 divided by 2, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0.**
