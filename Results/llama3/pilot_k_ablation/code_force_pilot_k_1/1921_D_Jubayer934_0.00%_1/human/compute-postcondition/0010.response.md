The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))`: This line calculates the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b`, and appends this value to the `result` list.

2. `a.remove(max(a))`: This line removes the maximum value from list `a`.

3. `b.remove(min(b))`: This line removes the minimum value from list `b`.

After executing these lines, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.

- `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.

- `m` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.

- `a` is modified by removing its maximum value. The length of `a` decreases by 1.

- `b` is modified by removing its minimum value. The length of `b` decreases by 1.

- `result` is modified by appending the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`. The length of `result` increases by 1.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list of integers with a length decreased by 1, b is a sorted list of integers with a length decreased by 1, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the original maximum value in a and the original minimum value in b.**
