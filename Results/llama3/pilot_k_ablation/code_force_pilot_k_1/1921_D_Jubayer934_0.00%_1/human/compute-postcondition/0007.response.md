The value of `b` is updated by removing the last element `b[n - 1]`. The length of `b` is reduced by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since the length of `b` is reduced by 1, the value of `n` is also reduced by 1. The state of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 divided by 2 minus 1, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n - 1` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
