Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with one line each. The current value of `m` equals `n` because the length of `a` equals the length of `b`.**
