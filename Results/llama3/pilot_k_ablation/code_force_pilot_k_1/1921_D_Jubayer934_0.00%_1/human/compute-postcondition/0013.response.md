The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum values in `a` and the minimum values in `b` for each iteration of the loop.
Output: ** `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is the minimum of `m` and `n`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length decreased by the minimum of `m` and `n`, `b` is a sorted list of integers with a length decreased by the minimum of `m` and `n`, `result` is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum values in `a` and the minimum values in `b` for each iteration of the loop. If `m` is less than `n`, `a` will be empty and `b` will have `n - m` elements left. If `n` is less than `m`, `b` will be empty and `a` will have `m - n` elements left. If `m` is equal to `n`, both `a` and `b` will be empty., and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum values in `a` and the minimum values in `b` for each iteration of the loop is printed**
