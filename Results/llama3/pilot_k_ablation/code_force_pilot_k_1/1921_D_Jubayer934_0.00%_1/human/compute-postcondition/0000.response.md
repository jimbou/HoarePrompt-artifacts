Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The stdin now contains the remaining input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `m` integers `b_i` (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
