The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, the input for `n` is the first integer of the first line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and the third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), and the first integer of the first line has been read and assigned to `n`.**
