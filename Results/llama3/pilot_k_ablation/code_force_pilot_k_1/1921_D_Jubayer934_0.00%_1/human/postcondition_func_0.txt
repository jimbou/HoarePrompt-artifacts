This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers m and n, followed by m integers a_i and n integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum values in a_i and the minimum values in b_i for each iteration of the loop, after removing the middle elements of b_i. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.
