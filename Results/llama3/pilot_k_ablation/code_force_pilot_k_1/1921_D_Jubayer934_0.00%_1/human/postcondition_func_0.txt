This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two sets of integers. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values of the two sets, after removing the middle elements of the second set and pairing the remaining elements in a specific order. The function prints the calculated sum for each test case.
