#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        m, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))[:m]
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b.sort()
        
        result = []
        
        n = n // 2
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if len(a) == len(b):
                break
            b.remove(b[n - 1])
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
            a.remove(max(a))
            b.remove(min(b))
        
        print(sum(result))
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `m` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `b` is not defined, `result` is not defined, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b` respectively has been printed for all test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two sets of integers. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values of the two sets, after removing the middle elements of the second set and pairing the remaining elements in a specific order. The function prints the calculated sum for each test case.
