Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the list `b`. The program removes the middle element of `b` (at index `n - 1`) until the length of `b` is equal to the length of `a`. This is not the correct approach to find the maximum difference.

A counterexample is when `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The program will remove the middle element `6` from `b` until the length of `b` is equal to the length of `a`, resulting in `b = [4, 5, 7, 8]`. Then, it will calculate the difference between the maximum element of `a` (3) and the minimum element of `b` (4), which is 1. However, the maximum difference can be achieved by choosing the elements `[8, 7, 5]` from `b`, resulting in a difference of 7 + 5 + 2 = 14.

The correct approach would be to sort both `a` and `b` in ascending order, and then calculate the difference between the maximum element of `a` and the maximum element of `b`, the second maximum element of `a` and the second maximum element of `b`, and so on. This way, the maximum difference can be achieved.
