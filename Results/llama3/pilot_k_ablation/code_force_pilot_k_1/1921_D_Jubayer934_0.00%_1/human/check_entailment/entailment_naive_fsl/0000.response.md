Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the list `b`. The program removes the `n-1`th element from `b` in each iteration, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach would be to remove the smallest and largest elements from `b` in each iteration, as this would maximize the difference between the elements of `a` and `b`.

For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, the program would remove the `n-1`th element from `b` in each iteration, which would result in `b = [4, 5, 6, 8]` after the first iteration. However, the correct approach would be to remove the smallest and largest elements from `b`, which would result in `b = [5, 6, 7]` after the first iteration.

This incorrect approach would result in an incorrect output for the maximum total difference `D`.
