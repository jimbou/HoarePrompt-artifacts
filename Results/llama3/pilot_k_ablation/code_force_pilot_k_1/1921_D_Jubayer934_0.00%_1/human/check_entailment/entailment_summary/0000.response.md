Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by first removing the middle elements of the array `b_i` and then calculating the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum values in `a_i` and the minimum values in `b_i`. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference `D` that can be obtained by arranging the elements of `b_i` in a certain order to make it as different as possible from `a_i`. The correct approach would be to sort both arrays `a_i` and `b_i` and then calculate the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements in the sorted arrays.

The given program is incorrect because it removes the middle elements of `b_i` without considering the actual values in `a_i`. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the values in `a_i` are not in the same order as the values in `b_i`.

Correctness: **False**
