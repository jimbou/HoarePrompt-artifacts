According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer greater than 0, which already ensures that the loop will execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains no input**
