Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k` is even and `k` > 0 and `k` <= `n`, `idx` is equal to `k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` are filled in an alternating pattern starting from 1 and `n` and the rest are zeros, `bottom_v` is `k/2` + 1, `top_v` is `n-k/2`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `permutation`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `result`, which is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces. This string is created by converting each element of `permutation` to a string using the `str()` function and then joining them together with spaces in between using the `' '.join()` method.
