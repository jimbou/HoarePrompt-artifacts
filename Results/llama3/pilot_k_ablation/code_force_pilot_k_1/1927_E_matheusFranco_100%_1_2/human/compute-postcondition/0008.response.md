Postcondition: ***n and k are positive integers such that k is even and k > 0 and k <= n. If idx is even, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros, bottom_v is 2, and top_v is n. If idx is odd, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[0] is n, and the rest are zeros, bottom_v is 1, and top_v is n-1. In both cases, idx is updated, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 0, and stdin contains no input.***
