Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even positive integer such that k > 0 and k <= n, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros, bottom_v is 2, top_v is n, idx is 0, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 0, stdin contains no input**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the first element of the `permutation` list, which is initially a list of zeros. Since `bottom_v` is 1, the first element of `permutation` becomes 1. The second line increments `bottom_v` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected by the code.
