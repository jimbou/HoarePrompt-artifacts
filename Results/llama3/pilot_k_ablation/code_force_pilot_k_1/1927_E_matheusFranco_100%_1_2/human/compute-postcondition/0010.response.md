Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k` is even and `k` > 0 and `k` <= `n`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n`, `idx` is equal to `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` are filled in an alternating pattern starting from 1 and `n` and the rest are zeros, `bottom_v` is `n/2` + 1, and `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, `bottom_v` is `(n+1)/2` and `top_v` is `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, stdin contains no input.**
