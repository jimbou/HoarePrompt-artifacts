Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k` is even and `k` > 0 and `k` <= `n`. If `idx` is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros, `bottom_v` is 2, and `top_v` is `n`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[0]` is `n`, and the rest are zeros, `bottom_v` is 1, and `top_v` is `n-1`. In both cases, `idx` is updated, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v` remain the same as in the initial state, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `k`, and `idx` is also updated, but its new value is not specified. The stdin still contains no input.
