Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k` is even and `k` > 0 and `k` <= `n`, `idx` is equal to `k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` are filled in an alternating pattern starting from 1 and `n` and the rest are zeros, `bottom_v` is `k/2` + 1 if `k` is even and `(k+1)/2` if `k` is odd, and `top_v` is `n-k/2` if `k` is even and `n-(k-1)/2` if `k` is odd, stdin contains no input.**
