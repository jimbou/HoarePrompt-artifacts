Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

`func_1` reads the values of n and k, initializes an array `permutation` of size n with zeros, and sets two pointers, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to 1 and n, respectively. It then iterates over the array in chunks of size k, filling in the values in a specific pattern.

The pattern used is as follows: for each chunk of size k, it fills in the values in an alternating manner, starting from the bottom (1) and moving up, and then from the top (n) and moving down. This is done to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The program then prints the constructed permutation as a string of space-separated values.

The key insight here is that the pattern used to fill in the values ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k are as evenly distributed as possible, which is a necessary condition for a k-level permutation.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
