Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1` generates a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, where every k-th index is filled in an alternating pattern starting from 1 and n. This is done by iterating over the indices of the permutation array in chunks of size k, and filling in the values in an alternating pattern.

Function `func_2` repeats the call to `func_1` a specified number of times based on user input, consuming all input from stdin.

The execution summaries of the functions suggest that `func_1` generates a valid k-level permutation, and `func_2` repeats this process for multiple test cases.

The problem statement guarantees that such a permutation always exists given the constraints, and the example output provided matches the expected output for the given inputs.

Therefore, based on the execution summaries and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
