This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the total sum of the integers and checks if it's possible to balance the list by redistributing the integers to make them all equal to the average value. If balancing is possible, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
