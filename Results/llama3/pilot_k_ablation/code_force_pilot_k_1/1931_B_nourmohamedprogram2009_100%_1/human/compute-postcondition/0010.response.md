The code prints the string 'YES'. This string is printed because the variable `possible` is True, indicating that the current balance is never less than 0. This suggests that it is possible to achieve the target sum by redistributing the integers in the list `a`. The value of `possible` is determined by the condition that the current balance, which is the sum of the differences between each integer in `a` and the target, is never less than 0.

Output: **YES**
