Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the average of these integers and checks if it's possible to balance the water among n containers by redistributing the water without exceeding the capacity of any container. If balancing is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
