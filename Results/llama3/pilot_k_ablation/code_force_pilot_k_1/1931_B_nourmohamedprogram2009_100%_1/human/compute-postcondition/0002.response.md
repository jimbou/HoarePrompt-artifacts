Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True.**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, assigning the value of n to the variable `n`. It then reads the `n` integers from stdin, assigning them to the list `a`. The sum of these integers is calculated and assigned to `total_water`. The target value is calculated by dividing `total_water` by `n`, which is possible because the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The `current_balance` is initialized to 0, and the `possible` flag is set to True. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.
