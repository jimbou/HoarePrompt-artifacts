Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True, `i` is 0. The current value of `current_balance` is less than 0.**
