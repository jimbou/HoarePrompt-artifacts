To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t` because they are the only variables in the loop head.


According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we can make it more specific by saying that `t` must be greater than 0.


The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter. However, we can say that it is initially 0 because the loop starts from 0.


State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**
