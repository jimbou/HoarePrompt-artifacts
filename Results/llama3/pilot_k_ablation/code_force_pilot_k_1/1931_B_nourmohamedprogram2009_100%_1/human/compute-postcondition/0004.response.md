Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0**

The code increments the `current_balance` by the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the `target`. The `target` is the integer division of the sum of the integers in `a` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
