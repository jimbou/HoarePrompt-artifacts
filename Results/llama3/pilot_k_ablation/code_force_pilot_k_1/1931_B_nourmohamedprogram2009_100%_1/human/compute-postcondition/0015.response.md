Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is n, current_balance is the sum of the differences between each integer in a and the target. If the current_balance is never less than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
