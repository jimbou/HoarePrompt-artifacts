Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 0. If the current balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
