Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and is at least 1, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is a[0] - target. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
