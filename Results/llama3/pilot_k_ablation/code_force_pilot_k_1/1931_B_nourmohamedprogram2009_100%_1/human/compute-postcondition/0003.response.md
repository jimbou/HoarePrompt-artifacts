To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to 0, as it will be the initial value in the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is True, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0**
