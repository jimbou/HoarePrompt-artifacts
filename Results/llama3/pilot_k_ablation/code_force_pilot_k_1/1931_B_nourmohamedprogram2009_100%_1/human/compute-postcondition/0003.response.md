To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`). 

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is True, `i` is 0**
