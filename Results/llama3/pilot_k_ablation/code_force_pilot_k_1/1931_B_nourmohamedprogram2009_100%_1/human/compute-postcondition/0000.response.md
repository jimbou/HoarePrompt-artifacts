Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, but the first input integer `t` has been consumed. The remaining inputs are still valid, with each test case consisting of an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
