Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, if the loop executes, current_balance is the sum of the differences between each integer in a and the target, if current_balance is ever less than 0, then possible is False, otherwise possible is True. If the loop does not execute, current_balance is 0 and possible is True.**
