stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2⋅10^9. Also, the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The number of test cases is between 1 and 10^4.
