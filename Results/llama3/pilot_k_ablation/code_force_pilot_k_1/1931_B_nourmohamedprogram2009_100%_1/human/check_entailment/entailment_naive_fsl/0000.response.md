Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water in each container. Then, it iterates through the containers, keeping track of the current balance of water. If at any point the current balance becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's water level equal to the target, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks the loop.

If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target. Therefore, the program is correct.
