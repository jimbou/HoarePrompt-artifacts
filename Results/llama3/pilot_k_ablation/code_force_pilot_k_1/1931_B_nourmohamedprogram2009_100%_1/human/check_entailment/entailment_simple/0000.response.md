Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2.  The program calculates the total amount of water `total_water` and the target amount of water in each container `target` by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers `n`. This is correct because the problem states that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3.  The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount `a[i] - target` and adds this difference to the `current_balance`. If the `current_balance` becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4.  Finally, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is `True` and "NO" otherwise. This is correct because if `possible` is `True`, it means that the amounts of water in the containers can be balanced by pouring water from one container to another, and if `possible` is `False`, it means that the amounts of water in the containers cannot be balanced.

Correctness: **True**
