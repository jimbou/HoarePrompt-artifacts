Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. It calculates the total sum of the integers and checks if it's possible to balance the list by redistributing the integers to make them all equal to the average value.
3. The program uses a greedy approach to check if balancing is possible. It iterates through the list of integers and keeps track of the current balance. If the current balance becomes negative at any point, it means that it's not possible to balance the list, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
4. If `possible` is still `True` after iterating through the entire list, the program prints 'YES', indicating that balancing is possible. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads multiple test cases, calculates the total sum and average value, and checks if balancing is possible for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
