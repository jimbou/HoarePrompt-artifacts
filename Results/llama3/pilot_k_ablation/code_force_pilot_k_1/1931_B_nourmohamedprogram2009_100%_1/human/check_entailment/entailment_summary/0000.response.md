Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input, which consists of a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of containers, followed by `n` integers representing the initial amount of water in each container.
2.  It calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total amount divided by the number of containers (`n`). This is correct because the problem states that the sum of the initial amounts of water is divisible by `n`.
3.  The program then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the current balance of water. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4.  Finally, the program prints 'YES' if it's possible to balance the water among the containers and 'NO' otherwise.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
