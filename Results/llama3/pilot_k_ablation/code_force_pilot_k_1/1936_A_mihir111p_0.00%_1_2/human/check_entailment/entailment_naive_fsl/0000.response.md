Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the maximum XOR value is not obtained by comparing the maximum OR value with the maximum OR value of another pair. 

For example, consider the case where the secret sequence is [3, 1, 2, 0]. The program will first find the maximum OR value, which is 3 (obtained by comparing 3 and 1). Then, it will find the maximum XOR value by comparing the maximum OR value with the maximum OR value of another pair. However, in this case, the maximum XOR value is actually obtained by comparing 3 and 2, not 3 and 1. 

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
