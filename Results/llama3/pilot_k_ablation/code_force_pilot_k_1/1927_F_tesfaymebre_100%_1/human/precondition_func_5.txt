n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and the graph represented by the edges in the input is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges, where each edge has a weight between 1 and 10^6, and there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself).
