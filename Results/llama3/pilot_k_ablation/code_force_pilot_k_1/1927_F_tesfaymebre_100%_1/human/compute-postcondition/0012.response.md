Output State: **n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, start and end are the nodes connected by the minimum edge. If no such edge exists, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1.**
