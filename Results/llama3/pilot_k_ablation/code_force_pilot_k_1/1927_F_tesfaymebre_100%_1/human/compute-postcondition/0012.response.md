Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, start and end are the nodes of the minimum weight edge. If the graph is empty, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.**
