Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges, edges is a sorted list of m tuples in descending order with at least one element, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w is the weight of the first edge, u is the first node of the first edge, v is the second node of the first edge, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which are method calls to the `find` method of the `dsu` object. The first line assigns the parent of node `u` in the DSU to the variable `parent_u`, and the second line assigns the parent of node `v` in the DSU to the variable `parent_v`. The DSU object is initialized with `n + 1` elements, and the `find` method returns the parent of a given node in the DSU. The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` are determined by the DSU's internal state, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since the DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements, we can infer that the DSU has a hierarchical structure, and the `find` method returns the root node of the subtree containing the given node. The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` are therefore the root nodes of the subtrees containing `u` and `v`, respectively.
