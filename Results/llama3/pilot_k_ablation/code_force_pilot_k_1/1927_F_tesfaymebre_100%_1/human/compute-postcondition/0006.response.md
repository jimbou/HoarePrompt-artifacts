Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is a sorted list of m tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w, u, v are the values of the first tuple in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`, `w`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only variables that are modified are `parent_u` and `parent_v`, which are assigned the parent of `u` and `v` in the DSU, respectively.
