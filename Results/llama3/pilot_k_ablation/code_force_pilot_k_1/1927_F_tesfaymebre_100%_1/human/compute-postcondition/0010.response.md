Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m number of edges, `edges` is a sorted list of m tuples in descending order with at least one element, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where the parent of `u` and the parent of `v` are the same, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `w` is the weight of the first edge, `u` is the first node of the first edge, `v` is the second node of the first edge, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the DSU which is the same as the parent of `v` in the DSU.**

In this output state, the DSU object `dsu` has been updated such that the parent of `u` and the parent of `v` are now the same, indicating that the nodes `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component. All other variables remain unchanged.
