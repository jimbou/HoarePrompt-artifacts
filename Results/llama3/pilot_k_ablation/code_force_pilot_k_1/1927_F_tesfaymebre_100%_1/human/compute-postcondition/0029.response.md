The only variable in the loop head is variable curr, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable curr. If curr is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, curr is the end node. If the graph is empty, curr is -1, so for the loop to execute the first time, the graph cannot be empty, and curr must not be -1.
State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges and the graph is not empty, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with all nodes except the end node mapped to their respective parent nodes in the shortest path from the start node to the end node, start and end are the nodes of the minimum weight edge, path is an empty list, curr is the end node and curr is not -1**
