To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `while curr != -1:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer
- `graph` is a dictionary with `m` pairs of nodes
- `edges` is an empty list
- `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements where all nodes are in the same set
- `_min_edge` is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set
- `start` is a node
- `end` is a node
- `que` is an empty deque
- `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node reachable from `start` (excluding `end`) to its previous node in the path from `start` to `end`
- `path` is an empty list
- `curr` is the node `end`

For the loop to execute at least once, `curr` must not be `-1`. Since `curr` is currently set to `end`, we need to ensure that `end` is not `-1`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` pairs of nodes, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, `start` is a node, `end` is a node and must not be -1, `que` is an empty deque, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node reachable from `start` (excluding `end`) to its previous node in the path from `start` to `end`, `path` is an empty list, `curr` is the node `end`**
