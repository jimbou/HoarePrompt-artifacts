Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges, edges is a sorted list of m tuples in descending order with at least one element, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, w is the weight of the first edge, u is the first node of the first edge, v is the second node of the first edge, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU, and parent_u is equal to parent_v.**

The code assigns the weight of the first edge to `_min_edge`, making it equal to `w`. It also assigns the first node of the first edge to `start`, making it equal to `u`, and the second node of the first edge to `end`, making it equal to `v`. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
