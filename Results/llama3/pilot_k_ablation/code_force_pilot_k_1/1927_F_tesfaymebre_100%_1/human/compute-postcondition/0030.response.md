Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, start is a node, end is a node and must not be -1, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary mapping each node reachable from start (excluding end) to its previous node in the path from start to end, path is a list containing the node end, curr is the previous node of end in the path from start to end.**

In this output state, the code has added the node end to the path list and updated the value of curr to be the previous node of end in the path from start to end. All other variables remain unchanged.
