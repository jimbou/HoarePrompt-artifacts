Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges and the graph is not empty, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with all nodes except the end node mapped to their respective parent nodes in the shortest path from the start node to the end node, start and end are the nodes of the minimum weight edge, path is a list containing the end node, curr is the parent node of the end node in the shortest path from the start node to the end node.**

The code appends the current node to the path and then updates the current node to be the parent node of the current node in the shortest path from the start node to the end node. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
