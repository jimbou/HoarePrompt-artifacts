Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, start is a node, end is a node, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary mapping each node reachable from start (excluding end) to its previous node in the path from start to end, path is an empty list, curr is the node end.**

The code snippet initializes an empty list `path` and assigns the value of `end` to `curr`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
