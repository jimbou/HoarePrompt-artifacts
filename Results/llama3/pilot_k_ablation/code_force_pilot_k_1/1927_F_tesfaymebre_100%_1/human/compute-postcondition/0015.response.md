Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m number of edges, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, `que` is a deque containing the nodes except the start node, `prev` is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, `start` and `end` are the nodes of the minimum weight edge. If the graph is empty, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1, `node` is the start node.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `node` is now the start node which was previously in the deque. The deque `que` now contains all the nodes except the start node. The values of the other variables remain the same.
