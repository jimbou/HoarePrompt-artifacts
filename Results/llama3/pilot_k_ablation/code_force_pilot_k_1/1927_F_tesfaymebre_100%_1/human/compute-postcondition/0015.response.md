Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, `start` and `end` are the nodes connected by the minimum edge and `start` is not -1, `que` is a deque containing the node `end`, `prev` is a dictionary with a single entry mapping `start` to -1, and `node` is assigned the value `start`.**

In this output state, the value of `node` has been updated to `start`, which is the node that was previously at the front of the deque `que`. The deque `que` now contains only the node `end`, which is the other node connected by the minimum edge. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
