Postcondition: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges, edges is a sorted list of m tuples in descending order with at least one element, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w is the weight of the first edge, u is the first node of the first edge, v is the second node of the first edge, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU. The current value of parent_u is equal to the current value of parent_v.**
