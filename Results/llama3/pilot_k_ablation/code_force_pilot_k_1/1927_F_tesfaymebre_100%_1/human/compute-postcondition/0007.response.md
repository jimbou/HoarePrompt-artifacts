Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is a sorted list of m tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w, u, v are the values of the first tuple in the list, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU. The current value of parent_u is equal to the current value of parent_v.***
