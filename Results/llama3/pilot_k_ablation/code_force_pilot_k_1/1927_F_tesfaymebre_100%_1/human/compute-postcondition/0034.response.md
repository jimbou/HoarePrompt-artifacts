The code prints the nodes in the path from start to end in the correct order, excluding the end node. The path is obtained by reversing the list of nodes in the path from start to end, which is stored in the `path` list.

Output: **the nodes in the path from start to end in the correct order, excluding the end node (where the path is obtained by reversing the list of nodes in the path from start to end)**
