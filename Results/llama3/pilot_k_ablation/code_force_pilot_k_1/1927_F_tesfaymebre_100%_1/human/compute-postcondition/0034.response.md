The code prints the elements of the `path` list in the original order (not reversed), because `path[::-1]` reverses the list and then `*` unpacks it into separate arguments to the `print` function.

Since `path` contains the shortest path from the start node to the end node, the output will be the nodes in the shortest path in the correct order from start to end.

Output: **the nodes in the shortest path from the start node to the end node in the correct order**
