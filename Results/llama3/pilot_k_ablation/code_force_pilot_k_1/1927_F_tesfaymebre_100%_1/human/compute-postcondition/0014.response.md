To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition, which is `while que:`. This loop will execute as long as `que` is not empty.

Given the initial state, `que` is a deque containing the node `start`. For the loop to execute at least once, `que` must not be empty. Since `start` is a node connected by the minimum edge (if such an edge exists) and is part of the initialization of `que`, we need to ensure that `start` is not -1, which is the value it takes if no such minimum edge exists.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `start` is not -1, implying that a minimum edge connecting two nodes that were initially in the same set must exist.

State: **n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, start and end are the nodes connected by the minimum edge and start is not -1, que is a deque containing the node start, prev is a dictionary with a single entry mapping start to -1.**
