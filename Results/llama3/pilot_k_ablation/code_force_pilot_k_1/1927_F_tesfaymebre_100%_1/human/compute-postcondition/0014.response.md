To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that must be met for the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while que:`, which means the loop will execute as long as the deque `que` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop, we have:

- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m
- `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)
- `graph` is a dictionary with m number of edges
- `edges` is an empty list
- `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set
- `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph
- `que` is a deque containing the node start
- `prev` is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1
- `start` and `end` are the nodes of the minimum weight edge. If the graph is empty, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.

The only variable in the loop head is `que`. For the loop to execute, `que` must not be empty. According to the given state, `que` is a deque containing the node start, which means it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `que` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m number of edges, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, `que` is a deque containing the node start, `prev` is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, `start` and `end` are the nodes of the minimum weight edge. If the graph is empty, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.**
