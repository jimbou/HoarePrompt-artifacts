Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes where node is a key and graph[node] is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, `start` and `end` are the nodes connected by the minimum edge and `start` is not -1, `que` is a deque containing the node `end` and possibly `nei` if `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev` is a dictionary with either one entry mapping `start` to -1 or two entries mapping `start` to -1 and `nei` to `node` if `nei` is not in `prev`.***
