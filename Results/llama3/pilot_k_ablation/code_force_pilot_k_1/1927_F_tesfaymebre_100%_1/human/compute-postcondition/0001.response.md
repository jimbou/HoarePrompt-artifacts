According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is unknown. So for the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must be at least 1.
State: **`test_cases` is at least 1**
