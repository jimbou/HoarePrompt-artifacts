Functionality: **This function takes no parameters and returns no values. It constructs a graph with n nodes and m edges, where n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and each edge has a weight. The function then finds the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, and if such an edge exists, it prints the weight of this edge and the number of nodes in the path from the start node to the end node in reverse order. Finally, it prints the nodes in the path from the start node to the end node in the correct order, excluding the end node. If no such edge exists, it prints positive infinity as the weight and -1 as the start and end nodes.**
