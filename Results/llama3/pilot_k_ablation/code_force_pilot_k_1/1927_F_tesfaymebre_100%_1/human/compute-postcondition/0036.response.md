Functionality: **This function takes no parameters and returns the minimum weight of an edge in the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted undirected graph, the number of nodes in this path, and the nodes in the path from start to end. If the graph is empty, it returns positive infinity as the minimum weight and -1 as the start and end nodes. If there is no path from the start node to the end node, it only returns the minimum weight and the number of nodes in the path (which will be 1).**
