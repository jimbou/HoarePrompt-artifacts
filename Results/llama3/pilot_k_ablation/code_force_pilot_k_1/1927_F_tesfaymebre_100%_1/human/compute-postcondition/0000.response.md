Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is unknown since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` has been updated to the result of calling the function `func_1()`. The original value of `test_cases` as a non-negative integer is no longer relevant, as it has been overwritten by the result of the function call. The definition of `func_1()` is not provided, so the exact value of `test_cases` after the function call is unknown.
