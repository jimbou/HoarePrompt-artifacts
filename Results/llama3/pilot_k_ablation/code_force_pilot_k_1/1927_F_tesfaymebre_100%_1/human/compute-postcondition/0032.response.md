The code prints the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, and the number of nodes in the path from start to end in reverse order.
Output: **_min_edge (the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set), len(path) (the number of nodes in the path from start to end in reverse order)**
