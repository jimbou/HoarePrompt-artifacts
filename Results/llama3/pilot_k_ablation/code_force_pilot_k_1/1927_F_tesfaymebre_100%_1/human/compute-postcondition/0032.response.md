Based on the precondition, we can determine the output as follows:

* `_min_edge` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the context, it is likely that `_min_edge` represents the minimum edge weight in the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
* `len(path)` represents the length of the shortest path from the start node to the end node. Since `path` contains the shortest path in reverse order, `len(path)` will give the number of nodes in the path.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **_min_edge (the minimum edge weight in the shortest path), len(path) (the number of nodes in the shortest path)**
