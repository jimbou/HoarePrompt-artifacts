Output State: **n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, start and end are the nodes connected by the minimum edge. If no such edge exists, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, que is a deque containing the node start, prev is a dictionary with a single entry mapping start to -1.**

The code creates a deque `que` and initializes it with the node `start`. It also creates a dictionary `prev` and adds an entry mapping `start` to `-1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, and `end` remain unchanged.
