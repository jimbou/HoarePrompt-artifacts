Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify it. The function `func_6()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are unknown, as its implementation is not provided. Therefore, we can only confirm that the function has been called, without specifying any changes to the program state.
