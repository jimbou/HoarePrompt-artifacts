Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, and the function `func_6` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify it. The function `func_6` has been called and executed, but its specific effects on the program state are unknown, as its implementation is not provided. Therefore, we can only conclude that the function has been executed, without specifying any further changes to the program state.
