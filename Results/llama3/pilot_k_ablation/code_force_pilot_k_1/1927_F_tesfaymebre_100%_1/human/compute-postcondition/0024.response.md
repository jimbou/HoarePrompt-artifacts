Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes where node is a key and graph[node] is not empty, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, start and end are the nodes connected by the minimum edge and start is not -1, que is a deque containing the nodes end and nei, prev is a dictionary with two entries mapping start to -1 and nei to node.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `que` deque now contains two nodes: `end` and `nei`, which were appended in the second line of the code. The `prev` dictionary has been updated to include a new entry mapping `nei` to `node`, in addition to the existing entry mapping `start` to -1.
