The only variables in the loop head are variables  `nei` and `graph` and `node`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `graph` and `node`. If the graph is not empty and the node is not equal to end, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, que is a deque containing the nodes except the start node, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, start and end are the nodes of the minimum weight edge. If the graph is empty, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1. If the current value of node is equal to the current value of end, the loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues to execute does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to graph is not empty and node is not equal to end and nei is the first neighbor of the node.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m number of edges that is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all elements are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge in the graph, `que` is a deque containing the nodes except the start node, `prev` is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, `start` and `end` are the nodes of the minimum weight edge, `node` is not equal to `end`, `nei` is the first neighbor of the node**
