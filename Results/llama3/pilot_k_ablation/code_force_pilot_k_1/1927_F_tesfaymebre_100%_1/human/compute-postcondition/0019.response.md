The only objects in the loop head are variables  `nei` and `graph` and `node`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` and `node`. If `node` is a key in `graph` and `graph[node]` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `graph` is a dictionary with `m` pairs of nodes, `node` is not specified, and `nei` is not specified. So for the loop to be executed, `node` must be a key in `graph` and `graph[node]` must not be empty and `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes where node is a key and graph[node] is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, `_min_edge` is the weight of the minimum edge that connects two nodes that were initially in the same set, `start` and `end` are the nodes connected by the minimum edge and `start` is not -1, `que` is a deque containing the node `end`, `prev` is a dictionary with a single entry mapping `start` to -1, `node` is a key in graph and graph[node] is not empty, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`.**
