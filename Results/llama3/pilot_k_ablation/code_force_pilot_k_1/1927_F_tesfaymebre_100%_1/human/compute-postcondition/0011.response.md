Postcondition: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m number of edges, edges is a sorted list of m tuples in descending order with at least one element, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements. If the parent of u is equal to the parent of v in the DSU, then _min_edge is w, start is u, and end is v. Otherwise, the parent of u and the parent of v in the DSU are the same, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.**
