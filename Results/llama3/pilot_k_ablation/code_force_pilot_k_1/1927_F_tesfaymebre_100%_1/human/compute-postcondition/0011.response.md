Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with m pairs of nodes, edges is a sorted list of m tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1 elements. If the parent of u and the parent of v are the same in the DSU, then _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v. Otherwise, the parent of u and the parent of v are the same in the DSU, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1.***
