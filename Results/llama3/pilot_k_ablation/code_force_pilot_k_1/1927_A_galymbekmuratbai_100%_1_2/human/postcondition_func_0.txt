The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates the minimum number of paint operations required to paint all 'B' characters in each string, which is the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' characters plus one. The function then prints the minimum number of paint operations required for each test case.
