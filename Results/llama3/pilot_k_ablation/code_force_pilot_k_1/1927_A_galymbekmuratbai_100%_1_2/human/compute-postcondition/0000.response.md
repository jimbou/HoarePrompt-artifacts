The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
