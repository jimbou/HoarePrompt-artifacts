Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters.

The program calculates the minimum number of paint operations required to paint all 'B' characters in each string by finding the indices of the first and last 'B' characters and adding 1 to their difference. This is a correct approach because it ensures that all 'B' characters are covered by the painted segment.

The program then prints the minimum number of paint operations required for each test case. The output matches the expected output provided in the problem description, which further confirms the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
