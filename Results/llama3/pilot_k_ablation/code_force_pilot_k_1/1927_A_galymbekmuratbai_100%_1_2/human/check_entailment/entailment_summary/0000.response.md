Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string and calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white by taking the difference between the indices of the last and first 'B' and adding 1. This approach ensures that all 'B' characters are covered in the minimum number of paint operations.

Correctness: **True**
