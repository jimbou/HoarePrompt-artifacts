The code appends an integer to the list L1. The integer is obtained from the input, where the input is an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) from the stdin. The stdin contains num lines each containing an integer x. Since one integer is taken from the stdin, the stdin now contains num - 1 lines each containing an integer x.

The value of i is used to prompt the user to enter the entry number, but it is not changed by the code.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, L1 contains one integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), res is an empty list, stdin contains num - 1 lines each containing an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000)**
