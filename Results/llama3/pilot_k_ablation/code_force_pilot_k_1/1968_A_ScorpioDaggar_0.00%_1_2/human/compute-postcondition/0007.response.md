Output State: **num is an integer that must be at least 1, L1 is a list of num integers each between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer, stdin is empty, i is 0, j is 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, the expression evaluates to an integer. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect the state of the variables.

After the code executes, the list `res` is no longer empty and contains one integer, which is the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The value of `i` remains 0, and the value of `j` remains 2. The list `L1` and the integer `num` are not modified by the code. Stdin remains empty as it was initially.
