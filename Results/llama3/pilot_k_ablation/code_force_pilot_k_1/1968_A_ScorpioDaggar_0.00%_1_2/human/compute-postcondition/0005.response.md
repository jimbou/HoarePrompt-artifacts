To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `L1[i]` is at least 2.

State: **`num` is an integer that must be at least 1, `L1` is a list of `num` integers each between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` must be at least 2, `j` is 2**
