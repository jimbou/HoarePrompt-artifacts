According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, `num` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`num` is an integer that must be at least 1, `L1` is a list of `num` integers each between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, stdin is empty, `i` is 0**
