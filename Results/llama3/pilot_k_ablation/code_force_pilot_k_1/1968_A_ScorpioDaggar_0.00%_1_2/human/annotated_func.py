#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list of `num` integers each between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, stdin is empty.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list of `num` integers each between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list of integers where each integer is the product of the largest divisor of the corresponding element in `L1` and the divisor minus one, stdin is empty.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: product of the largest divisor of each element in L1 and the divisor minus one, for each element in L1, each on a new line

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a series of integers as input from the user, calculates the product of the largest divisor of each integer and the divisor minus one, and prints the results. The function accepts a variable number of integer inputs, each between 2 and 1000, and returns no value, instead printing the calculated products to the console, one per line.
