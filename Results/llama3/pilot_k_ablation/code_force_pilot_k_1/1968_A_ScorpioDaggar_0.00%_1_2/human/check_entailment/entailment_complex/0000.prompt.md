Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list of `num` integers each between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, stdin is empty.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list of `num` integers each between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list of integers where each integer is the product of the largest divisor of the corresponding element in `L1` and the divisor minus one, stdin is empty.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: product of the largest divisor of each element in L1 and the divisor minus one, for each element in L1, each on a new line

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a series of integers as input from the user, calculates the product of the largest divisor of each integer and the divisor minus one, and prints the results. The function accepts a variable number of integer inputs, each between 2 and 1000, and returns no value, instead printing the calculated products to the console, one per line.
