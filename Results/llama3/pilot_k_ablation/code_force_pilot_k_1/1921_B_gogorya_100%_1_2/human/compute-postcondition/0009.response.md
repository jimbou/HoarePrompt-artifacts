The code prints the sum of `res` and the integer division of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res` by 2.
Where `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters of `s1` and `s2` are different.
Output: **res + floor(abs(hd - res) / 2) (where res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters of s1 and s2 are different)**
