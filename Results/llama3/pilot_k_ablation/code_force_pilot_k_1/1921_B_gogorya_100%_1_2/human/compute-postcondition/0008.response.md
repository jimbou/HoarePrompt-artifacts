Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, hd is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters of s1 and s2 are different, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of t, _, n, s1, s2, and hd remain unchanged. The new variable res is introduced, which is assigned the absolute difference between the number of '1's in strings s1 and s2. The stdin remains empty.
