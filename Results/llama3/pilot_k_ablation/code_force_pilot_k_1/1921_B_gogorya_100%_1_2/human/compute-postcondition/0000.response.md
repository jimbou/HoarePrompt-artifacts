Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by two strings s and f of length n, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (between 1 and 10^5) followed by two strings `s` and `f` of length `n`, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
