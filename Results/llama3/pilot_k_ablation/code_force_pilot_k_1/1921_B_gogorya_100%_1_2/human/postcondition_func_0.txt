This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two binary strings of equal length. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the two strings identical, where an operation is either flipping a bit or swapping two bits. The function prints the result for each test case and consumes all input from standard input, leaving it empty.
