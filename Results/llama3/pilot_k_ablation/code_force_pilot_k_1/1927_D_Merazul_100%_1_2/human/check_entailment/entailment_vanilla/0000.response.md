Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a pair of different elements within a given range in an array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the length of the array `n` and then ignores it by not assigning it to any variable. This is not an issue because the length of the array is not used anywhere in the program.

3. It then reads the array `a` and creates a new array `a` where each element `a[i]` is the index of the previous element that is different from the current element `a[i]`. If all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same, then `a[r]` will be less than `l`.

4. After that, it reads the number of queries `q` and then enters another loop that runs `q` times.

5. Inside this loop, it reads the range `[l, r]` for each query and checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`. If it is, that means all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same, so it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints `a[r]` and `r`, which are the indices of two different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
