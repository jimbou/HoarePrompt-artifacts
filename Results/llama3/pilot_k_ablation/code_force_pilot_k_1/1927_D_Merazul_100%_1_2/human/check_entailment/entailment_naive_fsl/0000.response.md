Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find a pair of different elements within a given range in the array. The program uses a clever approach to keep track of the last index of a different element as it iterates through the array, which allows it to efficiently answer queries.

The program first reads the input and initializes an array `a` to store the last index of a different element for each position in the array. It then iterates through the array, updating the `a` array and keeping track of the last index of a different element.

When answering queries, the program simply checks if the last index of a different element for the right boundary of the query is within the query range. If it is, it prints the indices of the different elements. If not, it prints -1 -1.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where the query range is the entire array, cases where the query range is a single element, and cases where there are no different elements within the query range.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
