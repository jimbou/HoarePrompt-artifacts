Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by iterating through the array and keeping track of the last index where the value was different from the current value. This is done by maintaining a list `a` where each element is either 0 (if the corresponding integer is equal to the previous one) or the index of the integer plus 1 (if it's different).

For each query, the program checks if the value at the specified index in the list `a` is less than the query's first value. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, it prints the value at the specified index in the list `a` along with the index.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the query range is the entire array, or when the query range is a single element.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + q), where n is the length of the array and q is the number of queries. This is because the program iterates through the array once to create the list `a`, and then iterates through the queries once to answer each query.

The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the program creates a list `a` of length n to store the indices of the different elements.

Correctness: **True**
