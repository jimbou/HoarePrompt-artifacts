Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of test cases, the length of the array, the array elements, and the number of queries.
2.  It processes the array elements to create a list `a` where each element is either 0 (if the corresponding integer is equal to the previous one) or the index of the integer plus 1 (if it's different). This is done to efficiently find the first different element for each query.
3.  For each query, it checks if the value at the specified index in the list `a` is less than the query's first value. If it is, it prints [-1, -1] because there are no different elements in the query range. Otherwise, it prints the value at the specified index in the list `a` along with the index, which represents the first different element in the query range.
4.  The program continues this process until all test cases have been read and processed.

Correctness: **True**
