Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are 0 if the corresponding element in R() is equal to the previous element, otherwise the element is the index of the element in R() plus 1, `p` is the last value yielded by R(), `i` is the number of elements in R() plus 1, `j` is 0 if the last element in R() is equal to the second last element, otherwise `j` is the index of the last element in R() plus 1, `q` is the last value yielded by R().**

In this output state, the value of `q` is the last value yielded by R(). The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because a new element is yielded by R(). The value of `j` is updated based on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
