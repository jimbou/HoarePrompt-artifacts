You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains the following inputs:
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, a is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are 0 if the corresponding element in R() is equal to the previous element, otherwise the element is the index of the element in R() plus 1, p is the last value yielded by R(), i is the number of elements in R() plus 1, j is 0 if the last element in R() is equal to the second last element, otherwise j is the index of the last element in R() plus 1, q is 0, l is the first value yielded by R() in the last iteration, r is the second value yielded by R() in the last iteration, and the output of the program is either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] for each iteration of the loop

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, a is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are 0 if the corresponding element in R() is equal to the previous element, otherwise the element is the index of the element in R() plus 1, p is the last value yielded by R(), i is the number of elements in R() plus 1, j is 0 if the last element in R() is equal to the second last element, otherwise j is the index of the last element in R() plus 1, q is 0, l is the first value yielded by R() in the last iteration, r is the second value yielded by R() in the last iteration, and the output of the program is either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] for each iteration of the loop


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
