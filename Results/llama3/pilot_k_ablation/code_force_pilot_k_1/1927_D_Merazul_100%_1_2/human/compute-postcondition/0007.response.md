According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, q is the last value yielded by R(). q being the last value yielded by R() does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to q is not equal to 0.
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are 0 if the corresponding element in R() is equal to the previous element, otherwise the element is the index of the element in R() plus 1, `p` is the last value yielded by R(), `i` is the number of elements in R() plus 1, `j` is 0 if the last element in R() is equal to the second last element, otherwise `j` is the index of the last element in R() plus 1, `q` is not equal to 0**
