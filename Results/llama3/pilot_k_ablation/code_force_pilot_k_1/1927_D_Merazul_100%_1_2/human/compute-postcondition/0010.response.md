Output: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, a is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are 0 if the corresponding element in R() is equal to the previous element, otherwise the element is the index of the element in R() plus 1, p is the last value yielded by R(), i is the number of elements in R() plus 1, j is 0 if the last element in R() is equal to the second last element, otherwise j is the index of the last element in R() plus 1, q is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, l is the first value yielded by R(), r is the second value yielded by R(), and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
