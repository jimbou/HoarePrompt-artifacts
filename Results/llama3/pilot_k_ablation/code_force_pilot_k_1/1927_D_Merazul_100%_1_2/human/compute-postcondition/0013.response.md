Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a sequence of integers and a number of queries. For each test case, it processes the sequence of integers to create a list where each element is either 0 (if the corresponding integer is equal to the previous one) or the index of the integer plus 1 (if it's different). Then, it answers each query by printing either the value at the specified index in the list along with the index, or [-1, -1] if the value at the specified index is less than the query's first value. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read and processed, at which point it terminates with no remaining input in standard input.**
