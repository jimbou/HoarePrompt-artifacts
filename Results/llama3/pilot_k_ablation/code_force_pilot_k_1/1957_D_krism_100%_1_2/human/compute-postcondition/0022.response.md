Postcondition: ***`ans` is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 in arr and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n in arr, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer in arr minus 1, `y` is the i-th integer in arr, `k` is the bit length of y minus 1, `c` is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of n integers, `prefix` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [number of zeros in the j-th bit of all integers from n to 1 in arr, number of ones in the j-th bit of all integers from n to 1 in arr], `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32. The current value of `c` has a 1 in the j-th bit position.***
