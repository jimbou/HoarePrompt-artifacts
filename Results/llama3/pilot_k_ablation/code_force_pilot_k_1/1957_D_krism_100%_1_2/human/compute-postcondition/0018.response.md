Output State: **`ans` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `arr` is a list of n integers, `prefix` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [number of zeros in the j-th bit of all integers from n to 1 in `arr`, number of ones in the j-th bit of all integers from n to 1 in `arr`].**

In this output state, a new variable `ans` is introduced and initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the lists `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, and `suf` retain their original values and structures.
