Postcondition: ***`cur` is the XOR of all integers from 1 to n in arr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, i is n, j is 0. The current value of `cur` has a 1 in the j-th bit position.***
