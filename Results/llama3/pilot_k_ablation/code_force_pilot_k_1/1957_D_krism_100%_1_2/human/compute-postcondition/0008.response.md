To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, because the loop iterates from `n` down to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, i is n**
