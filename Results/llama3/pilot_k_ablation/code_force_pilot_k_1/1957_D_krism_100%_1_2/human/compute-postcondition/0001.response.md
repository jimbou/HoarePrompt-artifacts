The only object in the loop head is variable  v and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the v is the first element in the list.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, prefix is a list containing a single element, 0, v is the first element in the list**
