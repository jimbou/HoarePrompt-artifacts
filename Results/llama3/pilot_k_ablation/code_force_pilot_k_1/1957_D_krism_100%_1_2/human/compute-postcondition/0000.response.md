Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing a single element, 0.**

In this output state, the code has read the first test case from stdin, which contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. The first test case has been processed, and its value has been assigned to the variable n. The list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) has been assigned to the variable arr. The prefix list has been initialized with a single element, 0. The remaining t-1 test cases are still in stdin, waiting to be processed.
