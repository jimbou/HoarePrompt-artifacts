To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the range `32`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range `32` is at least 1. Since `32` is a constant and always greater than 0, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it starts from 0, which is the beginning of the range.

State: **`cur` is the XOR of all integers from 1 to n in arr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, i is n, j is 0**
