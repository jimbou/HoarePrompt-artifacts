The code `pre[i][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[i][0]` by 1. Since `i` is 0, this means that `pre[0][0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `arr` is a list of n integers, `prefix` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where `pre[0][0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, `i` is 0**
