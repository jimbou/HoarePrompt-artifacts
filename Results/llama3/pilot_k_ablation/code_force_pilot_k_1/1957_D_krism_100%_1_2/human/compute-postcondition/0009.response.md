Output State: **`cur` is the XOR of all integers from 1 to n in arr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, i is n**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `cur` is assigned the value of the XOR of all integers from 1 to n in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged, including the list `arr`, the list `prefix` which contains the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in `arr`, the list `pre` which contains 32 lists each with [1,0], the list `suf` which contains 32 lists each with two zeros, and the variable `i` which is equal to n. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
