The code prints the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 in `arr` and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n in `arr`, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer in `arr` minus 1.
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 in `arr` and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n in `arr`, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer in `arr` minus 1)**
