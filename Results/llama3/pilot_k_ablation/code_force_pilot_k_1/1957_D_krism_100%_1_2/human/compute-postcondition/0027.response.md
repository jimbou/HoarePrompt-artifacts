Output State: **ans is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 in arr and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n in arr, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer in arr minus 1, y is the i-th integer in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, i is 1, n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [number of zeros in the j-th bit of all integers from 1 to i in arr, number of ones in the j-th bit of all integers from 1 to i in arr], suf is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [number of zeros in the j-th bit of all integers from n to 1 in arr, number of ones in the j-th bit of all integers from n to 1 in arr]. The number of zeros and ones in each bit of all integers from 1 to i in arr is correctly counted and stored in pre. The number of zeros and ones in each bit of all integers from n to 1 in arr is correctly counted and stored in suf.**
