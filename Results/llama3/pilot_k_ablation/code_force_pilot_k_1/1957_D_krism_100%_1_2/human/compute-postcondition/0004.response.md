Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros.**

In this output state, the initial state remains unchanged, with stdin containing t-1 test cases, arr being a list of n integers, and prefix being a list of n+1 integers where each element is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr. The code introduces two new variables, pre and suf, each initialized as a list of 32 lists, with each inner list containing two zeros.
