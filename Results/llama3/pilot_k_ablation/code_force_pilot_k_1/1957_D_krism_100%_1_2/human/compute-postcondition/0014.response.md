Output State: **`cur` is the XOR of all integers from 1 to n in arr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], suf is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [1,0] and the rest of the lists contain two zeros, i is n, j is 0, and the j-th bit of cur is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `suf[j][0]` being 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The j-th list in `suf` now contains [1,0], while the other lists in `suf` still contain two zeros.
