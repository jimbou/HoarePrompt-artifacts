Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, prefix is a list containing two elements: 0 and v ^ 0, v is the first element in the list**

In this output state, the value of prefix has been updated by appending the result of the bitwise XOR operation between v and the last element of prefix (which is 0). This results in prefix now containing two elements: 0 and v ^ 0, which simplifies to 0 and v. The values of the other variables, including stdin, arr, and v, remain unchanged.
