Output State: **`cur` is the XOR of all integers from 1 to n in arr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, arr is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, prefix is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], suf is a list of 32 lists each containing [1,1] at the j-th index and two zeros elsewhere, i is n, j is 0. The current value of `cur` has a 1 in the j-th bit position.**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `suf` being a list of 32 lists each containing [1,1] at the j-th index and two zeros elsewhere. The other variables remain unchanged.
