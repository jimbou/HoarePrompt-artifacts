This function reads an integer n from standard input, followed by n integers, and calculates the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer minus 1. It then prints this sum to standard output. The function performs this calculation for each test case, where the number of test cases is specified by an integer t read from standard input before the first test case.
