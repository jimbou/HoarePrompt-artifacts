Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of tuples (x, y, z) that satisfy the given conditions.

The program uses a prefix XOR array to efficiently calculate the XOR of subarrays. It also uses two arrays, `pre` and `suf`, to keep track of the number of elements that have a certain bit set or unset in the prefix and suffix of the array, respectively.

The program then iterates over the array, updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays and calculating the number of tuples that satisfy the condition for each element. The final answer is the sum of these counts.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the input array has only one element or where the XOR of two subarrays is zero.

I have thoroughly reviewed the code and could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
