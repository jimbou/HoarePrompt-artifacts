Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #State: `ans` is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 in `arr` and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n in `arr`, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer in `arr` minus 1, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [number of zeros in the j-th bit of all integers from 1 to n in `arr`, number of ones in the j-th bit of all integers from 1 to n in `arr`], `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the j-th list contains [0, number of ones in the j-th bit of all integers from 1 to n in `arr`], `prefix` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element (1 <= i <= n) is the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in `arr`, `arr` is a list of n integers, `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is 0, `ans` is 0, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], `suf` is a list of 32 lists where each list contains [1,0], `prefix` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are the XOR of all integers from 1 to i in `arr`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 in `arr` and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n in `arr`, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer in `arr` minus 1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer n from standard input, followed by n integers, and calculates the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from 1 to i-1 and the number of zeros and ones in the k-th bit of all integers from i to n, where k is the bit length of the i-th integer minus 1. It then prints this sum to standard output. The function performs this calculation for each test case, where the number of test cases is specified by an integer t read from standard input before the first test case.
