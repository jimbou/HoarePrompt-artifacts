Based on the initial state, the variables `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. The `print` statement is printing the maximum and minimum values of `a` and `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the maximum value will be the larger of the two, and the minimum value will be the smaller of the two.

Output: **max(a, b) (which is the maximum value between a and b), min(a, b) (which is the minimum value between a and b)**
