Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), we can conclude that:

* The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
* The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

Note that the values of `x` and `y` are not yet assigned, as they will be read from the input in subsequent lines.
