The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).**
