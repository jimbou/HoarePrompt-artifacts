Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), `t` must be greater than 0, and the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b` are being printed, where the maximum value is the larger integer between `a` and `b` and the minimum value is the smaller integer between `a` and `b`.**
