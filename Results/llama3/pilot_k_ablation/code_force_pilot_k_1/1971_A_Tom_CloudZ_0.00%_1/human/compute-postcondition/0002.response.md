Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), `t` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first two space-separated integers from the input, which are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been read. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
