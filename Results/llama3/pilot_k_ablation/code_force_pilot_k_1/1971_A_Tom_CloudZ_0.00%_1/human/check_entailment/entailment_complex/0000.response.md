Reasoning:

The problem statement requires the program to output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. However, the annotated program prints the maximum of x and y followed by the minimum of x and y. This is a clear mismatch between the problem statement and the program's behavior.

Correctness: **False**
