Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer, and print the maximum and minimum values of each pair.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` and prints the maximum and minimum values of the pair.

However, there is a mistake in the print statement. The program prints the maximum value first, followed by the minimum value, whereas the problem statement requires the minimum value to be printed first, followed by the maximum value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
