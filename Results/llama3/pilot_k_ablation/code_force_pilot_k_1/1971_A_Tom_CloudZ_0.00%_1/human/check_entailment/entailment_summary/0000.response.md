Reasoning:

The program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer. It then prints the maximum and minimum values of each pair. The program uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python to find the maximum and minimum values of each pair, respectively.

The program's logic is correct. It reads the input as specified, processes the input correctly, and produces the expected output. The use of `map` to convert the input strings to integers is also correct.

However, the problem statement requires the output to be in the order of minimum followed by maximum, but the program prints the maximum followed by the minimum. This is a mistake.

Correctness: **False**
