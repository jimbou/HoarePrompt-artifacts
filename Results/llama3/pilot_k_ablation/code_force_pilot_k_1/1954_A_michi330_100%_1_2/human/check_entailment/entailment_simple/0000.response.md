Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of parts `n`, the number of colors `m`, and the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`.

The program then checks two conditions:

1. `n <= k`: If the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, then Bob can always make all parts have the same color by repainting all parts. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is true, then Bob can make all parts have the same color by repainting the parts that are not painted with the most frequent color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

If neither of the above conditions is true, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
