Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if Bob can repaint at most k parts to make all parts have the same color. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n = 1, m = 1, or k = 1. The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of parts that Bob needs to repaint to make all parts have the same color.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
