Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is correct. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, so Alice cannot paint it in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts have the same color, so again Alice cannot paint it in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the corresponding result.

Correctness: **True**
