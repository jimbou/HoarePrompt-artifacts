The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, m, and k. It then determines whether a certain condition is met for each case, printing 'Yes' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise. The condition is that the number of elements (n) is greater than k and the number of elements minus the ceiling of n divided by m is also greater than k. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
