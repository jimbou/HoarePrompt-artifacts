The only variables in the loop head are variables  itest and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `itest` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is at least 1, `itest` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
