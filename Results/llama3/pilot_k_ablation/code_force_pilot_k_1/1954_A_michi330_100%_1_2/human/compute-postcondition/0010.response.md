Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin is empty, `itest` is `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last values read from stdin, which are integers between 1 and 50. The output contains `t` lines, each containing either 'NO' or 'Yes', depending on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` for each input line.**
