Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `itest` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is larger than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is larger than `k`, then 'Yes' is printed.***
