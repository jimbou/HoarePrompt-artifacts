This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It then finds the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the list, and prints this value for each test case. The function processes all test cases and prints all answers before terminating.
