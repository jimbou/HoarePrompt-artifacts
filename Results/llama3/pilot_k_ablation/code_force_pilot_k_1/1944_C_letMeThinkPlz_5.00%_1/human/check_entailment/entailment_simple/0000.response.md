Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. It creates a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
3. The program then iterates over the range of `n` and checks if the current integer `i` is not present in the `counter` dictionary (i.e., its count is 0). If so, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the array `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`, and since Alice wants to maximize the score, she will try to include all smaller integers in `c`.
4. If the current integer `i` is present in the `counter` dictionary with a count of 1 and `once` is still `False`, it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and breaks the loop. This is because Bob wants to minimize the score, and if he sees an integer with a count of 1, he will try to remove it to prevent Alice from including it in `c`. Since Alice wants to maximize the score, she will try to include the next integer in `c`.
5. The program prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the MEX of the array `c` and the final score of the game.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
