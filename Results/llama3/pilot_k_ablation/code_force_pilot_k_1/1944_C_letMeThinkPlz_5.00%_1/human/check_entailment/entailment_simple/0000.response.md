Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `arr` using a dictionary `counter`.

2. It then iterates over the numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If a number `i` is not present in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it means that Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, and the program sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

3. If a number `i` is present in the array but its count is 1 (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`), it means that Bob can delete this number to minimize the score. In this case, Alice can choose the next number `i+1` to maximize the score, and the program sets `ans` to `i+1` and breaks the loop. The `once` variable is used to ensure that this case is only considered once, because after that, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest available number.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that the array contains all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest available number, which is `n`.

5. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum score that Alice can achieve.

Correctness: **True**
