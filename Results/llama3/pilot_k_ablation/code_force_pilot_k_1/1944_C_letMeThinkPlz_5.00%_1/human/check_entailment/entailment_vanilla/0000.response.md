Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.
3. It creates a dictionary `counter` to store the frequency of each element in the array.
4. It initializes a variable `ans` to store the final answer and a flag `once` to track whether a single occurrence of an element has been found.
5. It iterates over the range of `n` and checks the following conditions:
   - If an element `i` is not present in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c`.
   - If an element `i` occurs only once in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and the `once` flag is not set, it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can pick the single occurrence of `i` and Bob cannot pick it, resulting in a MEX of `i + 1`.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the final answer.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
