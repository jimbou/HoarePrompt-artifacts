Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array, then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, so it is the MEX of the array and the program prints it. If a number appears only once in the array, it is the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the array, so it is the MEX of the array and the program prints it. If all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present in the array and appear more than once, the MEX of the array is n, but the program does not handle this case explicitly. However, this case is not possible according to the problem description, because the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, so n is at most 2 * 10^5, and the array contains n integers, each of which is less than n.

Correctness: **True**
