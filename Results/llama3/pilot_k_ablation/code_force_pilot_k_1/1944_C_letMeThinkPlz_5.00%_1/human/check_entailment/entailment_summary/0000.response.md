Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n, and checks if the current number is not present in the array or if it appears only once. If it finds such a number, it prints it as the answer.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she wants to include as many numbers as possible in her array c. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the score, which means he wants to remove as many numbers as possible from the array a. The program's strategy takes into account these opposing goals and finds the optimal solution.

Correctness: **True**
