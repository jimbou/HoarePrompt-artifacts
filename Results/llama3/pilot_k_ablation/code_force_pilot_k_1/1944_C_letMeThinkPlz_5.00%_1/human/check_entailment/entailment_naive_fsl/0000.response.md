Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize it. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n, and if a number is not present in the counter, it means that Alice can choose that number to maximize the score, and the game ends. If a number is present only once in the counter, it means that Alice can choose that number to maximize the score, and Bob will choose the other number, and the game ends. The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the array contains only one number, and the case where the array contains multiple numbers.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that Alice and Bob take turns choosing numbers, and that Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it. The program's use of a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently determine which numbers are present in the array and how many times they appear.

Overall, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
