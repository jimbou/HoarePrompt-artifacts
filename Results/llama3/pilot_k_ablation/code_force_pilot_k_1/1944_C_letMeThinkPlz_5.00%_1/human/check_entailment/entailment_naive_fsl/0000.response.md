Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1 to find the smallest number that is not present in the array or is present only once. This is because Alice can choose the numbers that are present only once to maximize the score, and Bob will try to minimize the score by choosing the numbers that are present more than once.

The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple numbers with the same count, and it also correctly handles the case where there are no numbers with a count of 1. The program also correctly handles the case where the input array is empty.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
