To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need a specific value). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, to make it explicit that the loop will execute, we can state that `t` is at least 1. The loop variable `_` can be adjusted to 0, as it will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop iterations.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
