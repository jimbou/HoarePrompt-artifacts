To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
