The value of `counter[i]` is updated to be the current value of `counter[i]` plus 1. If `i` is not already a key in `counter`, then `counter.get(i, 0)` returns 0, so `counter[i]` is set to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary where `counter[i]` is 1 and `i` is the first element in `arr`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element in `arr`.**
