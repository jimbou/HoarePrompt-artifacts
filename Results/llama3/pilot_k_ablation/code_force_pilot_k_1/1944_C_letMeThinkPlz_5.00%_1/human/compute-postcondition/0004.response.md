The value of `counter[i]` is assigned the value of `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`. The value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is the value of `counter[i]` if `i` is in `counter`, otherwise it is 0. Since `counter` is an empty dictionary, `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0. Therefore, `counter[i]` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`.**
