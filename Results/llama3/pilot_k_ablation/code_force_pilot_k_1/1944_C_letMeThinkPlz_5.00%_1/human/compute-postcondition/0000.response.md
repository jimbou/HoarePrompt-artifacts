Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second input is a list of n integers (0 <= a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer from the stdin, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the structure of each test case remains the same. The first integer in each test case is still a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second input is still a list of n integers (0 <= a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases still does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
