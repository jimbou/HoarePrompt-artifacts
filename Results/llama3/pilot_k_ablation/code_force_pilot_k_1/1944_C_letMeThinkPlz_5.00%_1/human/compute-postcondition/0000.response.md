Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since we have already read the first input. Each test case still has two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the second line contains `n` integers between 0 and `n-1`.
