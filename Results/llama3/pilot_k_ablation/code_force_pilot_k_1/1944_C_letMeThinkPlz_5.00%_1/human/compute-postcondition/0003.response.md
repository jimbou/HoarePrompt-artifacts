To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary, and `stdin` contains no input, these states do not affect the execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
