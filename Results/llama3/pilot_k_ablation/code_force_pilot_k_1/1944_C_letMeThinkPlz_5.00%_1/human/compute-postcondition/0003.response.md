To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is an empty dictionary, and `stdin` is empty. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust them.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `i` must be the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`**
