The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is either the first missing element in the range of `n` or the first element that appears only once in `arr` plus one.

Since `ans` is determined by the conditions `once` and the counts of elements in `arr`, we need to consider these factors to determine the exact value of `ans`.

If `once` is `True`, it means that `ans` is the first element that appears only once in `arr` plus one. In this case, `ans` will be the value of the first element that appears only once in `arr`, incremented by 1.

If `once` is `False`, it means that `ans` is the first missing element in the range of `n`. In this case, `ans` will be the smallest integer in the range of `n` that is not present in `arr`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `n`, and `once` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the first missing element in the range of `n` or the first element that appears only once in `arr` plus one.

Output: **the first missing element in the range of n or the first element that appears only once in arr plus one**
