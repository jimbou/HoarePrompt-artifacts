The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either the smallest integer in the range [0, n) that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest integer in the range [0, n) that appears exactly once in `arr` if such an integer exists and `once` is False, otherwise `ans` is 0.

Output: **the smallest integer in the range [0, n) that does not appear in arr or the smallest integer in the range [0, n) that appears exactly once in arr if such an integer exists and once is False, otherwise 0**
