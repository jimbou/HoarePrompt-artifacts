Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line assigns an integer value to `n`, and the second line assigns a list of integers to `arr`. The `counter` variable is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. Stdin is now empty since two lines of input have been read.
