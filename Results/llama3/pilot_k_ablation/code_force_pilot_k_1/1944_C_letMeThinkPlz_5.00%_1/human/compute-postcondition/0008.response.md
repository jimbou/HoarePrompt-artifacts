Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where `counter[i]` is the count of each integer `i` in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0. The current value of `counter[i]` is 0, meaning the integer `i` has not been encountered in `arr` yet.**
