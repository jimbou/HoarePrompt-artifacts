Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, meaning the count of the element at index `i` in `arr` is 0.**
