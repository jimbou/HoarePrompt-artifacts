To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is at least 1, we can set `n` to be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes. We also need to set `i` to 0, as it will be the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
