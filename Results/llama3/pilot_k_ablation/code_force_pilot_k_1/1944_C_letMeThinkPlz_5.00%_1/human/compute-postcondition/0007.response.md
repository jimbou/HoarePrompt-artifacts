To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, but this does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1, and `i` to be 0 (since it will start from 0 in the range).

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where `counter[i]` is the count of each integer `i` in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0**
