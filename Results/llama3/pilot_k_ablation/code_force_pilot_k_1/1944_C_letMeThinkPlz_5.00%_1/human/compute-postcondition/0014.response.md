Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary where `counter[i]` is the count of each integer `i` in `arr`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0. If the count of the integer at index `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 0 and `once` is False. If the count of the integer at index `i` in `arr` is exactly 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is False.***
