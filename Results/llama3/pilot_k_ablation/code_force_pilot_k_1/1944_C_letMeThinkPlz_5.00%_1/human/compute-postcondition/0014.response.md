Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is at least 1, arr is a list of integers, counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, stdin is empty, i is 0. If the count of the element at index i in arr is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the count of the element at index i in arr is greater than 0, then if the count is 1 and once is False, ans is i + 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and once remains False.***
