Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the specified operation.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first checks if the entire array is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, it prints 'YES' and moves on to the next test case.

2. If the array is not sorted, it finds the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order. It then checks two conditions:
   - If the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the unsorted part of the array.
   - If the unsorted part of the array can be sorted in ascending order.

3. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
