Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix of the array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. It first checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, it prints 'YES'.
2. If the array is not sorted, it finds the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order (i.e., `a[i-1] > a[i]`).
3. It then checks if the unsorted part of the array (from the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order to the end) can be sorted in ascending order by checking if `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for all `i` in the unsorted part.
4. It also checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the unsorted part by checking if `a[0] > new[i]` for all `i` in the unsorted part.
5. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
