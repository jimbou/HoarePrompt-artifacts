Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will print 'YES' because the array is already sorted. However, if the input is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], the program will also print 'YES' because it only checks if the first element is greater than the rest of the array, which is true in this case. But the array cannot be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix.

The program should check if the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix, not just if the first element is greater than the rest of the array. It should also check if the rest of the array is sorted after the swap.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all and a[0] >= new[-1]:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

This corrected version checks if the rest of the array is sorted after the swap and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the last element of the swapped array.
