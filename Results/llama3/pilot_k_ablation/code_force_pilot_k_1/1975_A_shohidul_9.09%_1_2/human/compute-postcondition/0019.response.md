Postcondition: ***t is an integer, check_all is a boolean, a is a list of n integers, n is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i], then either 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited if both check_all and new_all are True, or 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited if either check_all or new_all is False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
