Postcondition: ***t is an integer, check_all is a boolean, a is a list of n integers, n is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, new is a list of n-i integers, new_all is a boolean, the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i]. If both check_all and new_all are True, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, either check_all is False or new_all is False, 'NO' is printed, and the innermost loop or if statement is exited.***
