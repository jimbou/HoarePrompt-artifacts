Output State: **t is an integer, check_all is a boolean, a is a list of n integers, n is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, new is a list of n-i integers, new_all is a boolean, the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i].**

The first line assigns to new a list of n-i integers from a. The second line assigns to check_all the boolean value of whether a[0] is greater than all elements in new. The third line assigns to new_all the boolean value of whether all elements in new are in non-decreasing order. No other variables are affected.
