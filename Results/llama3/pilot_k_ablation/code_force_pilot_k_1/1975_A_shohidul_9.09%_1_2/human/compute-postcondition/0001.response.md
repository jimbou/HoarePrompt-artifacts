The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (2 <= t <= 50), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and then a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (2 <= t <= 50) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and then a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), `_` is 0**
