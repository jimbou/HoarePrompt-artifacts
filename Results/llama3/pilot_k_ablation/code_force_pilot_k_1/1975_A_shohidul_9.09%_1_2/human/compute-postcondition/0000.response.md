The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n`, the first input read by `int(input())` is the number of test cases `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (2 <= t <= 50), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and then a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)**
