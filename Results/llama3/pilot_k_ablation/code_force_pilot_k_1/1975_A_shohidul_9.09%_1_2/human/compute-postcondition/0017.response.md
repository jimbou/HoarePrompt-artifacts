Output State: **t is an integer, check_all is a boolean, a is a list of n integers, n is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, new is a list of n-i integers, new_all is a boolean, the current value of a[i - 1] is greater than the current value of a[i], Either check_all is false or new_all is false, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of a[i - 1] is still greater than the current value of a[i], and either check_all is false or new_all is false, and 'NO' is being printed.
