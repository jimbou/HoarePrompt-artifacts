Output State: **`t` is an integer, `check_all` is False, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `new` is a list of `n-i` integers, `new_all` is True, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, and 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `check_all` is changed to False because the break statement is executed, indicating that the condition for `check_all` is no longer met. The other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
