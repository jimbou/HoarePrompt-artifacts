To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `ind < n` and `it < k`.

Given the initial states:
- `tar` is a positive integer (no direct influence on the loop condition)
- `k` is a positive integer
- `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`
- `it` is 0
- `ind` is 0

The loop will execute if both conditions are met:
1. `ind < n`
2. `it < k`

Since `ind` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, `ind < n` is guaranteed to be true because 0 is less than any positive integer.

For the second condition, `it < k`, since `it` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, `it < k` is also guaranteed to be true because 0 is less than any positive integer.

Therefore, given the initial states, both conditions are already satisfied, and no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0**
