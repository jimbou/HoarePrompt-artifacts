Output State: **tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n, it is 0, ind is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `it` and `ind`, and assigns them both the value 0. The initial state's variables, `tar`, `k`, and `n`, remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. The relationship between `k` and `n` also remains valid, as the code does not affect their values.
