Output State: **`tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `x`. Since the initial state mentions that "? 1 tar" is printed, it is likely that the input is related to this print statement. However, the exact value of the input is not specified, so `x` is assigned an integer value. The values of the other variables (`tar`, `k`, `n`, `it`, and `ind`) remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since an input has been read.
