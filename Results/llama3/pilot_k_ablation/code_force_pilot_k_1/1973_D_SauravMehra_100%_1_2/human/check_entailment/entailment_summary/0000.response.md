Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with the product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the target value `tar` within the range of 1 to `n`.

The program first finds the maximum value `mx` that can be multiplied by `n` to get a valid `f(l, r)` value. It then calculates the target value `tar` as `n // k * mx` and iteratively decreases `tar` by `mx` until it finds a valid value or reaches 0.

The `func_1` function is used to check if a given `tar` value is valid. It performs a series of queries to find the target value `tar` within the range of 1 to `n`. It iteratively asks for input, updates its search index, and checks if the target has been found. The function returns `True` if the target is found at the `n`th position after `k` iterations, and `False` otherwise.

The program then checks if the `tar` value is valid by calling the `func_1` function. If the `tar` value is valid, it prints the answer as `tar`. If the `tar` value is not valid, it prints the answer as -1.

The program also checks the response from the judge and exits if the response is -1.

Based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the target value and checks the validity of the target value using the `func_1` function. The program also handles the case where the target value is not valid and prints the answer as -1.

Correctness: **True**
