Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search strategy to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`.

The program first finds the maximum possible value of `m` by querying the maximum value of the entire array. Then, it performs a binary search on the range `[1, tar]` to find the largest value `m` that satisfies the condition.

The function `func_1` is used to check if a given value `tar` can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays. It iteratively queries the input to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = tar`, and updates the search index `ind` accordingly. If `ind` reaches `n` and `it` reaches `k`, it means that the value `tar` can be achieved, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program correctly handles the case where no such `m` exists by checking if `tar` is less than or equal to 0. If so, it prints `-1` as the answer.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
