Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program fails is when the maximum value `mx` is not the maximum value in the array, but rather a value that is close to the maximum value. In this case, the program will incorrectly assume that the maximum value is `mx` and will not find the correct solution.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`, `k = 2`, and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The maximum value in the array is `10`, but the program will find `mx = 9` and will not be able to find a solution.

Another case where the program fails is when the array has duplicate maximum values. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct solution because it will not be able to determine which maximum value to use.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`, `k = 2`, and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]`. The maximum value in the array is `9`, but the program will not be able to determine which `9` to use and will not be able to find a solution.

Overall, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and therefore has a correctness of **False**.
