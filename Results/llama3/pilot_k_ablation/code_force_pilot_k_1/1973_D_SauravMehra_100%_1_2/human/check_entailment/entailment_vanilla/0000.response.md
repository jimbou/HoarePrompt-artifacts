Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the hidden array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`.

3. It then enters a loop where it keeps increasing the maximum value `mx` until it finds a value such that the product of `n` and `mx` is equal to the maximum value that can be obtained from the array.

4. Once it finds this maximum value, it calculates the target value `tar` by dividing `n` by `k` and multiplying it with `mx`.

5. It then enters another loop where it keeps decreasing the target value `tar` by `mx` until it finds a value such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the product of their length and maximum equal to `tar`.

6. If it finds such a value, it prints the value and reads the response from the input. If the response is `-1`, it exits the program.

7. If it cannot find such a value, it prints `-1` as the answer.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the product of their length and maximum equal to the target value `tar`. This function works by iterating over the array and checking if the product of the length of each subarray and its maximum is equal to `tar`. If it finds a subarray that does not satisfy this condition, it returns `False`. If it successfully splits the array into `k` subarrays, it returns `True`.

Overall, the program's logic is correct and it should be able to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
