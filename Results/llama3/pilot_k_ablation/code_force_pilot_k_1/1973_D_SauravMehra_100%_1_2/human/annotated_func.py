#State of the program right berfore the function call: tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n.
    it = 0
    ind = 0
    while ind < n and it < k:
        print(f'? {ind + 1} {tar}')
        
        x = int(input())
        
        if x == n + 1:
            return False
        
        ind = x
        
        it += 1
        
    #State: `tar` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, `it` is equal to the minimum of `k` and `n`, `ind` is equal to the value of `x` in the last iteration of the loop, `x` is an integer such that `x != n + 1`, and stdin contains no input.
    return ind == n and it == k
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the value of `ind` is equal to `n` and the value of `it` is equal to `k`, where `ind` is the value of `x` in the last iteration of the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `it` is the minimum of `k` and `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a series of queries, up to a maximum of k, to find a target value tar within a range of 1 to n. It iteratively asks for input, updates its search index, and checks if the target has been found. The function returns True if the target is found at the nth position after k iterations, and False otherwise.
