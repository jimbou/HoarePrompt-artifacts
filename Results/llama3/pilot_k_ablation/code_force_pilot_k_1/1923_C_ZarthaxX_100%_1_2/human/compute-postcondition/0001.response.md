To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 1, as specified in the loop head.


State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of pairs of integers, `i` is 1**
