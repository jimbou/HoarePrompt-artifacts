Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, `i` is n, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are a pair of integers from the input, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers minus one pair.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values of a pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one less pair of integers.
