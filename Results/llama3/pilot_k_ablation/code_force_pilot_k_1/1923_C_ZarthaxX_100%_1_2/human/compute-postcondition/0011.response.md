Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, i is n, _ is 0, l and r are a pair of integers from the input, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers minus one pair, onesInRange is the count of 1's in the range of nums from index l-1 to r, sumInRange is the sum of the elements in the range of nums from index l-1 to r.**

The code snippet calculates the count of 1's and the sum of elements in a specific range of the list `nums`. The range is defined by the pair of integers `l` and `r` from the input. The variables `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are assigned the count of 1's and the sum of elements in the range of `nums` from index `l-1` to `r`, respectively. The values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one pair of integers has been consumed.
