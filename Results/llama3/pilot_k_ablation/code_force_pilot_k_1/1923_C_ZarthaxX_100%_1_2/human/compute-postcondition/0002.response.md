The code snippet consists of two lines that update the values of `ones` and `sum` lists based on the values of `nums` list and the current index `i`.

The first line updates the value of `ones` at index `i` by adding 1 to the value of `ones` at index `i-1` if the value of `nums` at index `i-1` is 1, otherwise it adds 0. This means that `ones` will keep track of the cumulative count of 1's in the `nums` list up to the current index.

The second line updates the value of `sum` at index `i` by adding the value of `nums` at index `i-1` to the value of `sum` at index `i-1`. This means that `sum` will keep track of the cumulative sum of the values in the `nums` list up to the current index.

Since `i` is 1, the code will update the values of `ones` and `sum` at index 1.

Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise ones[1] is 0, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0], stdin contains a series of pairs of integers, i is 1**
