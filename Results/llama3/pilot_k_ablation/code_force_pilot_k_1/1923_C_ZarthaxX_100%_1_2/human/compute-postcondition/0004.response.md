To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers, `i` is n, `_` is 0**
