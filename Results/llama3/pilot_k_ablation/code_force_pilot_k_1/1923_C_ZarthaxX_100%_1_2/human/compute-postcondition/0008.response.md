Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, `i` is n, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are a pair of integers from the input, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers minus one pair. The current value of `l` equals the current value of `r`, and 'NO' is being printed**
