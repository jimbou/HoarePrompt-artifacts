Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1's in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums, i is n, _ is 0, l and r are a pair of integers from the input, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers minus one pair, onesInRange is the count of 1's in the range of nums from index l-1 to r, sumInRange is the sum of the elements in the range of nums from index l-1 to r. If 2 times onesInRange plus the length of the range minus onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
