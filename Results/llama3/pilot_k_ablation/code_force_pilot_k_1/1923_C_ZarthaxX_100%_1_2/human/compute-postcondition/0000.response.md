Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `n` and the integer value of the second input to `q`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `q` is also a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `nums`. Since the list of integers is a list of positive integers, `nums` is a list of positive integers. The third and fourth lines initialize `ones` and `sum` as lists of `n+1` zeros. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains a series of pairs of integers.
