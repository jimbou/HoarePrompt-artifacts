This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of queries, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on a condition involving the count of 1's and the sum of elements in a subarray. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but it modifies the state of the program by consuming input from stdin and printing output to the console. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given condition is met for each query, and it performs this action by iterating over the queries, calculating the count of 1's and the sum of elements in the specified subarray, and printing the result.
