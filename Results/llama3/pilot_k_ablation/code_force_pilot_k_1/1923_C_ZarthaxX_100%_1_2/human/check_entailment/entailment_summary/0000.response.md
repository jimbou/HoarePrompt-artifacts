Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the count of 1's and the sum of elements in the subarray, respectively. This is done efficiently using prefix sum arrays.

2. For each query, the program calculates the count of 1's and the sum of elements in the specified subarray using the prefix sum arrays. This is done in constant time, making the program efficient for large inputs.

3. The program then checks the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` to determine whether the subarray is good or not. This condition is derived from the given conditions in the problem statement and is correct.

4. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This is consistent with the problem statement.

5. The program handles the edge case where `l == r` correctly by printing 'NO' immediately.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
