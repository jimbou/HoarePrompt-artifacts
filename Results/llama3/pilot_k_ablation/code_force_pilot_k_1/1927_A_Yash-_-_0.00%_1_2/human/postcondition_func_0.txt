This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each test case, it calculates and prints the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string, or 0 if the string contains only 'W' characters. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
