The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple inputs, after this line, stdin will contain t-1 inputs. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `x`. Since stdin contains t-1 inputs, after this line, stdin will contain t-2 inputs.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 inputs.**
