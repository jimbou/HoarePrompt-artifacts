Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), then for each test case, first a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, which is assigned from the input. The stdin still contains multiple inputs, but the first input (integer t) has been consumed, so now it contains t-1 integers, and for each test case, the first input (integer n) has also been consumed, so now it contains a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
