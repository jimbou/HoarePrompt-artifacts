Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 inputs. If 'B' is present in x, the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in x is printed. Otherwise, if x consists only of 'W' characters, 0 is printed.***
