Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 inputs, start is the index of the first 'B' in x, end is the index of the last 'B' in x.**

The code snippet assigns the index of the first 'B' in the string `x` to the variable `start`, and the index of the last 'B' in the string `x` to the variable `end`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `x`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
