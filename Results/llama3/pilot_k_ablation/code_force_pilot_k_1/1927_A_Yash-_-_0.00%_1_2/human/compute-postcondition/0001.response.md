The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), then for each test case, first a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters**
