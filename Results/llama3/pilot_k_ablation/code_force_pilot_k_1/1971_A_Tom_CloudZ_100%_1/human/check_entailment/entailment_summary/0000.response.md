Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers for a specified number of test cases. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly using `int(input())`.
2. It then iterates `t` times using a `for` loop, which is correct.
3. Inside the loop, it reads two integers `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is correct.
4. It then prints the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b` using `print(min(a, b), max(a, b))`, which is correct.

The program's logic is straightforward and aligns with the problem description. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
