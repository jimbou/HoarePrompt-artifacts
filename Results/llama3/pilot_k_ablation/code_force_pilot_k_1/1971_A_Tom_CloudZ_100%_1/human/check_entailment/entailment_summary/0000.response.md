Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers (a and b) and prints the minimum and maximum of these two integers using the built-in min() and max() functions in Python.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program. It reads the specified number of pairs of integers, prints the minimum and maximum of each pair, and does not return any value.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
