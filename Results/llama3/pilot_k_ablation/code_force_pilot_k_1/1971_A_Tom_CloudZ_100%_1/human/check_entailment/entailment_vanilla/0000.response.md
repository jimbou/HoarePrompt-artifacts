Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterating through each test case.
2. In each test case, two integers (x and y) are read, and the minimum and maximum of these two integers need to be printed.
3. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates through each test case using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, it reads two integers (a and b) using the `map()` function and the `split()` method, which is correct.
5. It then prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions, which is also correct.
6. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
