Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y, and output them in that order.

2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.

3. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

4. Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from the input using the `map()` function, which applies the `int()` function to each input value.

5. It then prints the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b` using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

6. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output for the given problem.

7. The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem, such as the range of input values (0 <= x, y <= 9) and the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 100).

8. The program produces the correct output for the example input provided in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
