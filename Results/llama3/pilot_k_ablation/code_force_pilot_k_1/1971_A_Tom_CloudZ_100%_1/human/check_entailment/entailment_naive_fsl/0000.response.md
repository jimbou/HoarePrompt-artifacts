Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum and maximum of the two numbers. The program uses the built-in min() and max() functions in Python, which correctly handle all possible cases, including when x and y are equal, when x is less than y, and when x is greater than y. The program also correctly handles the case when x and y are both 0. The program does not have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
