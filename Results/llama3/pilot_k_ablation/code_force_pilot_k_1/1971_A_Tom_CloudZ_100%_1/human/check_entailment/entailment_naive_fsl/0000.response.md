Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. The program takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses the built-in min() and max() functions in Python, which correctly determine the minimum and maximum of two numbers.

The program also handles all possible cases, including when x and y are equal, when x is less than y, and when x is greater than y. The program also handles the case when x and y are both 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it does not contain any errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct.
