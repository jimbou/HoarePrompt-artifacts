Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input integer. It then prints the minimum and maximum of each pair.

The program first reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration of the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from the input.

The program then uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b`, respectively, and prints these values.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly reads the number of test cases, reads each pair of integers, finds the minimum and maximum of each pair, and prints these values.

Correctness: **True**
