Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains at least t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first two space-separated integers from the input, which are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The stdin now contains at least `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
