Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100, but since one line of input has been consumed, it is now between 1 and 99. The value of `_` remains 0. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two space-separated integers from the first line of input, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 9.
