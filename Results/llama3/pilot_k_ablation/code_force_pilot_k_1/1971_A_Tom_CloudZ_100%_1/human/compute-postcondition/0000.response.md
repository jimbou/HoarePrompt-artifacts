The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines, each containing two space-separated integers (0 <= x, y <= 9). So, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and stdin now contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers (0 <= x, y <= 9).**
