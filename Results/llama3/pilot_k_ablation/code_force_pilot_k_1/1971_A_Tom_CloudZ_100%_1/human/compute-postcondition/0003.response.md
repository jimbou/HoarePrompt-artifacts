The code prints the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b`. Where `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
Output: **min(a, b) (where min(a, b) is the minimum value between a and b), max(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the maximum value between a and b)**
