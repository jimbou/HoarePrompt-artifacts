Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Function 1 (func_1) takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the array itself (arr).

The function initializes two dictionaries, mod_x and mod_y, to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y, respectively. It also initializes a count variable to store the number of beautiful pairs.

The function then iterates over the array elements. For each element, it calculates the remainder when divided by x (rem_x) and the remainder when divided by y (rem_y). It then checks if the negative of rem_x is present in mod_x and rem_y is present in mod_y. If both conditions are true, it increments the count by the product of the values in mod_x and mod_y.

After that, it updates the mod_x and mod_y dictionaries with the current element's remainder when divided by x and y, respectively.

Finally, the function appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the results list and returns it.

Function 2 (func_2) reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls Function 1 to calculate the results. It then prints the results.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It uses dictionaries to efficiently store and look up the remainders of the array elements, which allows it to calculate the count of beautiful pairs in O(n) time complexity.

Correctness: **True**
