Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Function 1 (func_1) takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It calculates the sum of the products of the counts of remainders when the elements of arr are divided by x and y. This is done by maintaining two dictionaries, mod_x and mod_y, to store the counts of remainders when the elements of arr are divided by x and y, respectively. The function returns a list of these sums, one for each test case.

Function 2 (func_2) reads input from the standard input, processes the input data, and calls Function 1 to calculate the results. It then prints each result in the list.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array by considering all possible pairs of indices and checking if the sum and difference of the corresponding elements are divisible by x and y, respectively. The use of dictionaries to store the counts of remainders when the elements of arr are divided by x and y is an efficient approach to solve the problem.
