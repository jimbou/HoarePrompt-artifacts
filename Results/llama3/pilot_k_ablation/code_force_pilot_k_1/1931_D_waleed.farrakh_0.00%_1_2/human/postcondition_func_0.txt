This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the products of the counts of remainders when the elements of arr are divided by x and y. The function returns a list of these sums, one for each test case. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
