To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `results` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `results` to be a non-empty list.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list of values returned by `func_1` for each tuple in `test_cases`, `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is a non-negative integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**
