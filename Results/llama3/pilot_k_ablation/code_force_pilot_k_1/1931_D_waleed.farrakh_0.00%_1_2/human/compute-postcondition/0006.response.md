The code prints the value of `result` which is a list of values returned by `func_1` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Since the exact `test_cases` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list of results returned by `func_1` for each tuple in `test_cases`.

Output: **[result] (where result is a list of values returned by func_1 for each tuple in test_cases)**
