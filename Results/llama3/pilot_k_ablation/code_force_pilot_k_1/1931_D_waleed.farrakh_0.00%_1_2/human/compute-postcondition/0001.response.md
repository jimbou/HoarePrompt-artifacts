To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not important, but for the loop to start, `_` can be considered as 0 (the first value in the range).

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer that must be at least 1, data is a list of strings, idx is 1, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin, _ is 0**
