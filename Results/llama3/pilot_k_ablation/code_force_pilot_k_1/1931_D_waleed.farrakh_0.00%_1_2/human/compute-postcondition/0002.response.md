Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer that must be at least 1, data is a list of strings, idx is 3, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin, _ is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code has added a new tuple to the `test_cases` list, containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` extracted from the `data` list. The `idx` variable has been incremented by 2, moving to the next pair of lines in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
