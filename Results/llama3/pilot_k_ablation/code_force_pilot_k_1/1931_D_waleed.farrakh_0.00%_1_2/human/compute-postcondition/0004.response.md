Output State: **`results` is a list of values returned by `func_1` for each tuple in `test_cases`, `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is a non-negative integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**

In this output state, the function `func_1` has been applied to each tuple in `test_cases`, and the returned values are stored in the `results` list. The other variables, `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, `idx`, and `input`, remain unchanged.
