Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `a` is 0, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
