The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains `t+1` inputs, where the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), and the remaining `t` sets of inputs contain an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'.

Since the first input is consumed by the `input()` function, the stdin now contains `t` sets of inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'.**
