The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
