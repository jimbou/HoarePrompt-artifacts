Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 1 and 100, `i` is still 0, `n` is still between 2 and 10, `a` is still 0, `b` is still an empty string, and `j` is still 0. The variable `s` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from `stdin`, which is between 2 and 10. The `stdin` now contains `t-2` sets of inputs, each set containing an integer `n` and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'.
