Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and currently contains a string with exactly one '1' character, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-2` sets of inputs, each set consisting of an integer `n` and `n` strings of length `n` with characters '0' or '1'.
