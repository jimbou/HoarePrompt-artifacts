Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1-n` sets of inputs: each set contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) and `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The current value of `a` is not 0, meaning that at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1', making `a` 'Triangle'. The value of `b` is either 'Square' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', or an empty string if no string `s` contains more than one '1'.**
