Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It only checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' (in which case it prints "Triangle") or a row with more than one '1' (in which case it prints "Square"). However, this is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
001
010
100
```

This grid forms a triangle, but the program will print "Square" because it only checks the number of '1's in each row, not their position.

A correct solution would need to check the position of the '1's in each row to determine the shape of the grid.
