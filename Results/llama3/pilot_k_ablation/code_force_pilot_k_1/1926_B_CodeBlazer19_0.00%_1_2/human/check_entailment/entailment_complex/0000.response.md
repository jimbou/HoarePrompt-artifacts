Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks each row of the grid separately and prints "Triangle" if it finds a row with exactly one '1', and "Square" if it finds a row with more than one '1'. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.

A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, and a square can have exactly one '1' in a row. The program does not consider the overall structure of the grid, it only checks each row individually.

For example, if the input is:

3
000
011
011

The program will print "Square" because it finds two rows with more than one '1'. However, the correct output should be "Triangle" because the grid forms a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
