Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks each row of the grid separately and prints 'Triangle' if exactly one '1' is found in a row, and 'Square' if more than one '1' is found in a row. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.

A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, and a square can have exactly one '1' in a row. The program does not consider the position of the '1' characters in the grid, which is crucial in determining the shape.

For example, the grid:

000
011
011

is a square, but the program will print 'Triangle' because it finds exactly one '1' in the first row.

Similarly, the grid:

00111
00010
00000
00000
00000

is a triangle, but the program will print 'Square' because it finds more than one '1' in the first row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
