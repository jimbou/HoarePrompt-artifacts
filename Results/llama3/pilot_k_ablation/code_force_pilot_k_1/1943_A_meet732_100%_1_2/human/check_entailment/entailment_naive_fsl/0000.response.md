Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize it. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and stores them in the `cntl` list. Then, it checks if the number 0 is present in the array. If not, the program prints 0 as the score. If 0 is present, the program sets the initial score to 2 (or the count of 0 if it's less than 2) and iterates through the `cntl` list. For each number `j` in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive), if the count of `j` is less than 2, the program checks if `j` is present in the array. If not, it prints `j` as the score. If `j` is present, the program decrements the score by 1. If the score becomes 0, it prints `j` as the score.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the array `a` contains only one element, when the array `a` contains multiple elements, and when the array `a` contains duplicate elements. The program also correctly handles the case when the number 0 is not present in the array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs.
