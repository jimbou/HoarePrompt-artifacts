To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

Additionally, since `j` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables `a`, `cntl`, and `c` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers, `c` is either 1 or 2**
