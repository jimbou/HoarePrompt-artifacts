Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers, `c` is either 0 or 1. If there exists an integer `j` in the range [1, n+1] such that `cntl[j]` is 0, then `c` is 0 and the loop has printed `j`. If no such `j` exists, then if `c` was initially 2, it is now 0, otherwise it remains 1.**
