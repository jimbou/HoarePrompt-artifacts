Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n non-negative integers. It then finds the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list or is present but has a count less than 2, and prints this integer. If no such integer is found, it prints 0. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty.**
