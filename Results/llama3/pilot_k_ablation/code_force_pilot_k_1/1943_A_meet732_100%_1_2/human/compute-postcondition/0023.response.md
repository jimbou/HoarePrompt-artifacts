Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers, `c` is either 1 or 2. If the current value of `cntl` at index `j` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current value of `cntl` at index `j` is not 0, then if `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 1 has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is 1, no action is taken.***
