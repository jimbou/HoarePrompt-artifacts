The value of `c` is decremented by 1. The value of `c` can be 1 or 2, so the value of `c` is now 0 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers, `c` is either 0 or 1. The current value of `cntl` at index `j` is not equal to 0**
