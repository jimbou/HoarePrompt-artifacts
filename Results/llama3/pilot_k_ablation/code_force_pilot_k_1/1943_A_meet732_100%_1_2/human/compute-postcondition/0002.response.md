To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the two that were just read, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.**
