Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers, `c` is either 1 or 2, the current value of `cntl` at index `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `j`, `a`, `cntl`, and `c` remain unchanged. The current value of `cntl` at index `j` is still 0, and the value of `j` which is 1 has been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
