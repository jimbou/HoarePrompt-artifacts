The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus the two that were just read. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element of `a` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the two that were just read, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element of `a` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the two that were just read, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.**
