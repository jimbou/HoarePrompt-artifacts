Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of `i` in list `a`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the two that were just read. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if there exists an integer `j` in the range [1, n+1] such that `cntl[j]` is 0, then `j` is printed and `c` is 0. If no such `j` exists, then if `c` was initially 2, it is now 0, otherwise it remains 1.***
