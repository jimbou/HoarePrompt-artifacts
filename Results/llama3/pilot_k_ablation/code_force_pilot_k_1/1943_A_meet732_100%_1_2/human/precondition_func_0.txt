stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a space-separated list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The list of integers contains n non-negative integers (0 <= a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
