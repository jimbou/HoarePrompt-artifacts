Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from b and the ith element from l, ans2 is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from c and the ith element from l, l is a list containing the remaining elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 0 elements, i is 0, and either k is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or k is an even integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.**

The code adds the ith element from list `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2`. As a result, `ans1` and `ans2` now contain the ith element from `l` in addition to the pairs of equal consecutive elements from `b` and `c`, respectively. The list `l` still contains the remaining elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, but its size has decreased by 1. The value of `i` remains 0, and the value of `k` is either 0 or an even integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, depending on whether we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged.
