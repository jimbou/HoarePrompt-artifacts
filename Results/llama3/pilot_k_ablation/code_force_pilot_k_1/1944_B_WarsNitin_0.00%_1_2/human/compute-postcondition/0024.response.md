Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from b, ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i], l is a list containing the remaining elements from b that are not in ans1, i is 1, k is an even integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.**

In this output state, the code has appended two copies of `c[i]` to `ans2`, and reduced `k` by 2. The value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
