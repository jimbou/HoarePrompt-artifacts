Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the remaining elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `k` is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
