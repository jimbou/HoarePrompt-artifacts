Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from `c`, `l` is a list containing the remaining elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that the break statement is directly inside.
