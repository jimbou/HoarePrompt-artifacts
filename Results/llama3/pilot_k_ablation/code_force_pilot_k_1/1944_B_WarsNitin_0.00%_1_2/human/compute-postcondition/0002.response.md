Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, l is an empty list.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The first line assigns the values of n and k to the corresponding variables. The second line assigns the list of 2n integers to a. The third and fourth lines assign the first and second halves of a to b and c, respectively, and sort them in ascending order. The fifth and sixth lines initialize ans1 and ans2 as empty lists. The seventh line multiplies k by 2 and assigns the result to req. The eighth line initializes l as an empty list.
