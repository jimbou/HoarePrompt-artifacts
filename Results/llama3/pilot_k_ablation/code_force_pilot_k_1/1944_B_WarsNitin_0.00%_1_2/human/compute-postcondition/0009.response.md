Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be greater than 1, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, l is an empty list, i is 1. b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1]. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
