Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, ans1 is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from b, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the remaining elements from b that are not in ans1, k is 0 or reduced by an even number, i is n-1 or the index where the loop broke. If the last element of b is not in ans1, then l contains the last element of b which is not in ans1.***
