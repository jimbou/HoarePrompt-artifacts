Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, selecting pairs of identical numbers from the first n integers and the last n integers, and prints out two lists of selected numbers. The function repeats this process for all test cases, emptying the standard input in the process.**
