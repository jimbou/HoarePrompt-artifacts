Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`, `i` is 1. `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b[i - 1]` is appended to the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged. The program continues to execute unless `k` is 0, in which case it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
