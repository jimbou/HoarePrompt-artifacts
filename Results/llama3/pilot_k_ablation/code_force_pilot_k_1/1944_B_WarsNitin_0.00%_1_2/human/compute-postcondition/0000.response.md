Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is between 2 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), and k is between 1 and floor(n/2) (inclusive). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n, where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
