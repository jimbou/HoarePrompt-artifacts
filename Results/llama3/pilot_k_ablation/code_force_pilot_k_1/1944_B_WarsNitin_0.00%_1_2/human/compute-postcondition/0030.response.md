Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from `c`, `l` is a list containing the remaining elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and either `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `k` is an even integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.**
