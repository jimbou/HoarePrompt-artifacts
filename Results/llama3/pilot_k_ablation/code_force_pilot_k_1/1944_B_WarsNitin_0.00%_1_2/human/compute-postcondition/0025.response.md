Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of equal consecutive elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the remaining elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `i` is 1, `k` is an even integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.***
