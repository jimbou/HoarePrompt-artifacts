Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be greater than 1, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, l is an empty list, i is 1, k is reduced by 2.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1`, which was initially an empty list. Since `b` is a sorted list and `i` is 1, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`. Therefore, `ans1` now contains two copies of the same value.
- The second line appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` again, resulting in `ans1` containing two copies of the same value.
- The third line decrements `k` by 2. The initial value of `k` is not specified, but it is reduced by 2 after the execution of the code.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
