To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer input from `stdin`. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains two inputs: the first is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then `t` space-separated integers (3 <= n <= 10^5). For the loop to execute, `stdin` must have at least one integer input, which means `t` must be greater than 0. Also, `i` is 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`stdin` contains two inputs: the first is an integer `t` that must be greater than 0 and then `t` space-separated integers (3 <= n <= 10^5), `i` is 0**
