To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and increments by 2). 

State: **`i` is equal to `a` if `a` is even and greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is odd and greater than or equal to 3, `a` is greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) if `a` is even, `p` is a list of even integers from 2 to `a - 1` (inclusive) if `a` is odd, stdin contains t space-separated integers**
