Output State: **`i` is equal to `a` if `a` is even and greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is odd and greater than or equal to 3, `a` is greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) if `a` is even, `p` is a list of even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) if `a` is odd, stdin contains t space-separated integers**

In this output state, the value of `i` is still dependent on the value of `a`, and `a` is still greater than or equal to 3. The list `p` now includes the value of `i`, which is either `a` or `a + 1`, depending on whether `a` is even or odd. The stdin still contains t space-separated integers.
