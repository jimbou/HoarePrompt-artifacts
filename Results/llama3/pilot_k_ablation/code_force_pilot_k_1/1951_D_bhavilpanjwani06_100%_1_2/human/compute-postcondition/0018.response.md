The code prints the difference between the number of coins Alice has (`n`) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end (`k`), plus 1, and the number 1.

Since `n` is larger than or equal to `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`, the expression `n - k + 1` will always be greater than 1.

The value of `n - k + 1` is the number of coins Alice has minus the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end, plus 1.

Output: **[n - k + 1] (where n - k + 1 is the number of coins Alice has minus the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end, plus 1), 1**
