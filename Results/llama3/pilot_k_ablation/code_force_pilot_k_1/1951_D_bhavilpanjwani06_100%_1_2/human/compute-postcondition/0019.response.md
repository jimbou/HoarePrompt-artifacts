The code prints the value of `n - k + 1` and the value `1`. Based on the precondition, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), and the current value of `k - 1` is less than the current value of `n - k + 1`. This implies that `n - k + 1` is greater than `k - 1`, which means `n - k + 1` is at least `k`. Since `n` is larger than or equal to `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n - k + 1` is at least `2`.

Output: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) — the number of test cases, each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. n is larger than or equal to k and n is not equal to k. The current value of k minus 1 is less than the current value of n minus k plus 1., 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and this is printed: n - k + 1 (which is at least 2) and 1**
