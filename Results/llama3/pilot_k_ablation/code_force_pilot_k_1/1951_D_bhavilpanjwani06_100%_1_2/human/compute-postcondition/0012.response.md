Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) — the number of test cases, each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. n is larger than or equal to k and n is not equal to k***
