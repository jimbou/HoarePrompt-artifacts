Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) — the number of test cases, each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are assigned the two positive integers from the first line of input, which are the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end, respectively. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed, leaving t-1 lines of input remaining.
