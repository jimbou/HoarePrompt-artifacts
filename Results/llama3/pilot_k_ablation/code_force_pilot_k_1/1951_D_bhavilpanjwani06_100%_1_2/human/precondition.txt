stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.
