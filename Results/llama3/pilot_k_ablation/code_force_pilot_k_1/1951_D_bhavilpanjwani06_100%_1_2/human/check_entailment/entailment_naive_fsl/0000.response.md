Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 255 and k = 8, the program should print "YES" and the prices for the stalls, but it prints "NO" instead.

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when k - 1 >= n - k + 1. In this case, the program should print "YES" and the prices for the stalls, but it prints "NO" instead.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle this case correctly. For example, it could print "YES" and the prices for the stalls, where the prices are calculated based on the values of n and k.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle this case correctly:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        prices = [n // k] * k
        remainder = n % k
        for i in range(remainder):
            prices[i] += 1
        print(*prices)
```
This modified program correctly handles the case when k - 1 >= n - k + 1, and prints the correct prices for the stalls.
