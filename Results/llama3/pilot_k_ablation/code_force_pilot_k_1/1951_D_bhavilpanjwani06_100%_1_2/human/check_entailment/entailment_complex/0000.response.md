Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Alice can buy the number of jewels Bob wants her to have, given the number of coins she has. The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and 1 because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1 because Alice can buy `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting the price of the first stall to `n - k + 1` and the price of the second stall to 1.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with `n` coins.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
