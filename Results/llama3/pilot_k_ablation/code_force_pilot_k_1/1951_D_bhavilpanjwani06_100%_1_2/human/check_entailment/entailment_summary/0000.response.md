Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where Alice has less coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (in which case it prints 'NO'), where Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (in which case it prints 'YES', 1, and 1), and where Alice has more coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy but can still buy the exact number of jewels by setting up two stalls (in which case it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1). 

In the last case, the program sets the price of the first stall to `n - k + 1` and the price of the second stall to 1. This ensures that Alice buys `k - 1` jewels from the first stall (leaving her with `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins) and then buys 1 jewel from the second stall (leaving her with `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) - 1` coins). Since `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, we have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) - 1 < n - k + 1`, which means Alice cannot buy any more jewels from the first stall. Therefore, Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
