This function determines whether Alice can buy the number of jewels Bob wants her to have, given the number of coins she has. It takes two positive integers `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have) as input. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and 1. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
