#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))

        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                leftOnes += 1
            elif i in a:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < leftOnes:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:

    #State: `stdin` is empty, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last values read from `stdin` (or remain undefined if `t` is 0), `a` and `b` are the last frozensets of integers read from `stdin` (or remain undefined if `t` is 0), `newk` is the last value of `k` divided by 2 rounded down (or remains undefined if `t` is 0), `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are the last values calculated in the loop (or remain 0 if `t` is 0), and either 'yes' or 'no' has been printed to the console for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) followed by two sets of integers (a and b). It then checks if it's possible to make the two sets equal by removing elements from both sets, with the constraint that the total number of removed elements is less than or equal to k. The function prints 'yes' if it's possible and 'no' otherwise, for each test case.
