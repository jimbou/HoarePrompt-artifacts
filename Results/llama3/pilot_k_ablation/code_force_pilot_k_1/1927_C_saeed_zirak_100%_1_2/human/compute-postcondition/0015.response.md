Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is only in `a`, then `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is only in `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `b`, then either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0.***
