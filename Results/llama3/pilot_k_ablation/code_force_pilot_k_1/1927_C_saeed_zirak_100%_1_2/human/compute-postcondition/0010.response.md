Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is not in `a`, and `i` is in `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still 1, `n` and `m` are still integers, `k` is still greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are still frozensets of integers, `leftOnes` and `aOnes` are still 0, `newk` is still `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is still 1, `stdin` is still empty, and `i` is still not in `a` and in `b`.
