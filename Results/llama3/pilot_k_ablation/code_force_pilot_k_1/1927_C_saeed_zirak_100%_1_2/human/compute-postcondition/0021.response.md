Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one common integer with `b`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one common integer with `a`, `newk` is `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `leftOnes` is greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b` and is equal to `aOnes` + 1, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a` and is equal to `bOnes` - 1 and is greater than or equal to `aOnes`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still 1, `n` and `m` are still integers, `k` is still greater than 0, `a` and `b` are still frozensets of integers with at least one common integer, `newk` is still `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is still 0, `stdin` is still empty, `leftOnes` is still greater than 0. The value of `aOnes` has increased by 1, and the value of `bOnes` is still greater than or equal to `aOnes`.
