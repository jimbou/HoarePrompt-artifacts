According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and it is now 1.
State: **stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) that must be greater than 0, `t` is 1**
