Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b` or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i` is not in `b`.***
