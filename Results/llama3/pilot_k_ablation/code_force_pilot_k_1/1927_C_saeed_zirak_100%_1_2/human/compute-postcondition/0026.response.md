Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is equal to the initial value of `leftOnes`, `stdin` is empty, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `k` is 0, then `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are all 0. If `k` is greater than 0, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or `aOnes` is one more than `bOnes` if `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes` and `leftOnes` is odd.**
