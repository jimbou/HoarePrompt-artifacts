Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) followed by two sets of integers (a and b). It then checks if it's possible to make the two sets equal by removing elements from both sets, with the constraint that the total number of removed elements is less than or equal to k. The function prints 'yes' if it's possible and 'no' otherwise, for each test case.**
