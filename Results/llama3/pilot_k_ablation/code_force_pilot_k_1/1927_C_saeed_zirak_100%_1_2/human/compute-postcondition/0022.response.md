Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one common integer with `b`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one common integer with `a`, `newk` is `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `leftOnes` is greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`***
