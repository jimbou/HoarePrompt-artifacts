Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer equal to the first input integer `t`, `a` is a list of integers containing the first test case integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0. Either `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0***
