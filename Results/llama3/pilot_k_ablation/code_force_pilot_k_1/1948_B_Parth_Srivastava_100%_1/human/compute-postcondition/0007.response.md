Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input integer t, a is a list of integers containing the first test case integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the i-th element of a, y is the first digit of the i-th element of a, n is greater than 0, c is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is such that the i-th element of a is greater than 10, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the last element of c. Additionally, y is strictly greater than x***
