Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first input integer t, a is a list of integers containing the first test case integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x is an integer, y is an integer, n is the number of elements in c, c is a list of integers where each element is either a single digit from the original list a or a pair of digits from the original list a, d is a sorted list of integers where each element is either a single digit from the original list a or a pair of digits from the original list a, b is a list of integers containing at least one element which is 1, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a list a is empty, then n is 0, c is an empty list, x is 0, and y is 0. If a list a is not empty, then n is at least 1, c contains at least one element, x is the last digit of the last element of a that is greater than 10, and y is the first digit of the last element of a that is greater than 10. The current value of c is equal to the current value of d.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new list `b` that contains at least one element, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
