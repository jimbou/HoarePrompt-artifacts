Postcondition: **k is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is greater than 0 and is either incremented by 1 or 2 more than its original value, c is a list with at least one element where if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements are y and x respectively, otherwise the last element is now equal to a[i], i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is the index of an element in a that is greater than 10, and either the first digit of the element in a at index i is less than or equal to the last digit of the element in a at index i or y is greater than x.**
