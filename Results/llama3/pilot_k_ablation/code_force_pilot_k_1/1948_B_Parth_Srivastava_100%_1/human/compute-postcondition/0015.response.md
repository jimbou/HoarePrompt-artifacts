The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `x` and `y` based on the current element of the list `a` at index `i`. 

The first line assigns the remainder of the current element of `a` divided by 10 to `x`. Since the current element of `a` is greater than 10, the remainder will be a single digit between 0 and 9.

The second line assigns the integer division of the current element of `a` by 10 to `y`. This will result in the tens digit of the current element of `a`, which is at least 1 since the current element is greater than 10.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `k`, `a`, `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 that must have at least 1 integer, x is a single digit between 0 and 9, y is at least 1, n is greater than 0, c is an empty list, and i is 0.**
