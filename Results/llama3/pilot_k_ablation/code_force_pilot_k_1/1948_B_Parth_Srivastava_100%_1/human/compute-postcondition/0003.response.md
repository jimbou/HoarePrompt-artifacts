Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first input integer t, a is a list of integers containing the first test case integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the i-th element of a, y is the first digit of the i-th element of a, n is 0, c is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is such that the i-th element of a is greater than 10.**

The code assigns the last digit of the i-th element of `a` to `x` and the first digit of the i-th element of `a` to `y`. Since `i` is greater than 0 and the i-th element of `a` is greater than 10, `x` and `y` are both integers. The values of `k`, `a`, `n`, `c`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
