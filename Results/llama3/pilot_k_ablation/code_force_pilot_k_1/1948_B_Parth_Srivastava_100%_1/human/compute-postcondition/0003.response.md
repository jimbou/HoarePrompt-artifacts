Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is greater than 0, c is an empty list, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is the index of an element in a that is greater than 10.**

In this output state, the values of k, a, n, c, and i remain unchanged. The value of x is now the last digit of the element in a at index i, and the value of y is now the first digit of the element in a at index i.
