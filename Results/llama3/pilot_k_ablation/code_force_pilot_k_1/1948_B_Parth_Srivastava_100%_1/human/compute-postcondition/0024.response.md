Postcondition: **k is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 that must have at least 1 integer, n is greater than 0 and is either incremented by 1 or 2 more than its original value, c is a list. If the current element of a is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, and if y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1], then if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements of c are y and x respectively, otherwise the last element of c is now equal to a[i]. If y is less than c[n - 1], then c contains the element from a at index i. If the current element of a is greater than 10 and i is 0, then x is a single digit between 0 and 9, y is at least 1, and if y is less than or equal to x, c contains y and x. Otherwise, c contains the first element of the original list a. If the current element of a is less than or equal to 10 or i is not 0, then x is 0, y is 0, and c contains the first element of a. i is either greater than 0 or 0.**
