Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 that must have at least 1 integer, n is greater than 0 and is 1 or 2 more than its original value, c is a list. If the current element of a is greater than 10 and i is 0, then x is a single digit between 0 and 9, y is at least 1, and if y is less than or equal to x, c contains y and x. Otherwise, c contains the first element of the original list a. If the current element of a is less than or equal to 10 or i is not 0, then x is 0, y is 0, and c contains the first element of a. i is 0.***
