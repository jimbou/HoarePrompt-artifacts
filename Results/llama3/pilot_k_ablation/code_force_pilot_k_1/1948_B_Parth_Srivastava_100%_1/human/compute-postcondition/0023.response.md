Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input integer t, a is a list of integers containing the first test case integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 element, x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, c is a list containing a single integer which is the first element of a, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. If i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i]. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c is a list containing the first digit of the current value of a[i] and the last digit of the current value of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is 1 and c is a list containing the first element of a. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then either a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is not 0.***
