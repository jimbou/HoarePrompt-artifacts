Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first input integer t, a is a list of integers containing the first test case integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the i-th element of a, y is the first digit of the i-th element of a, n is 1, c is a list containing the i-th element of a, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is such that the i-th element of a is greater than 10, and y is less than c[0].**

The code appends the i-th element of list `a` to list `c` and increments the value of `n` by 1. The value of `n` is now 1, and list `c` contains the i-th element of `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
