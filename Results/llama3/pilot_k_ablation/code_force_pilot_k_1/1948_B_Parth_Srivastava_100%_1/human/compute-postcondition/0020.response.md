Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input integer t, a is a list of integers containing the first test case integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c is a list containing the first digit of the current value of a[i] and the last digit of the current value of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is 1 and c is a list containing the first element of a.***
