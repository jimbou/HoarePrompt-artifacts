Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of list `c`, `c` is a list that contains the elements from list `a` with the numbers greater than 10 split into two digits if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c`, otherwise the number is appended as is, `d` is a sorted list of the elements in `c`, `c` is not equal to `d`, and `b` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `b` now has an additional element 0 appended to it.
