Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, storing the number of test cases in `m` and the test cases in `a`.

2. The `func_1` function is not defined in the given code, but based on the context, it seems to be a placeholder for the actual function that performs the operation. Assuming `func_1` is correctly implemented, the program calls it `m` times to process each test case.

3. Inside the loop, the program checks if the current element `a[i]` is greater than 10. If it is, the program splits the element into two digits `x` and `y` and checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the previous element in the sorted list `c`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the previous element, the program appends `y` and `x` to the list `c`. If `y` is less than the previous element, the program appends the original element `a[i]` to the list `c`.

4. After processing all elements in the test case, the program checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with the sorted list `d`. If `c` is sorted, the program appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.

5. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in `b` is 1; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
