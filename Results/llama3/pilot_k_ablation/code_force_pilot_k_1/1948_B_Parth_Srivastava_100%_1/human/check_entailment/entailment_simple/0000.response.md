Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero).

The program works by iterating through each element in the input array. If an element is greater than 10, it checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit and greater than or equal to the last element in the list c. If this condition is met, it splits the element into two digits and appends them to the list c. Otherwise, it appends the element as is.

After processing all elements, the program checks if the list c is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version. If they are equal, it means the list c is sorted, and the program appends 1 to the list b. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list b.

The program then prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in the list b is 1, indicating that it is possible to make a sorted array. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
