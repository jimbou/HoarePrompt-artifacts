Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the described operation and checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program handles all possible cases, including when the first element is greater than 10, when the first element is not greater than 10, and when the array is already sorted. The program also correctly appends 1 to the output list if the array is sorted and 0 if it is not.

Correctness: **True**
