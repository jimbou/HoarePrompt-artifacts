Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array has less than 2 elements. In the problem description, it is stated that the array has a length of at least 2. However, the program does not check for this condition and will throw an error when trying to access the second element of the array (index 1) when the array has only one element.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will throw an error when trying to access a[1] in the line "if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:". This is because the array a has only one element, and there is no second element to access.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this edge case.
