Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the input array contains a number that is greater than 99. In this case, the program will not correctly split the number into its digits and will not check if the resulting array is sorted.

For example, if the input array is [100, 2, 3], the program will not correctly split the number 100 into its digits 1, 0, and 0, and will not check if the resulting array [1, 0, 0, 2, 3] is sorted. The program will incorrectly print "NO" for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
