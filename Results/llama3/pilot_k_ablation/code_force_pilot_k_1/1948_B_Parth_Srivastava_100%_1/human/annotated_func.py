#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

If c is equal to d, meaning that the list c is sorted, then b is a list with an additional element 1 appended to it. If c is not equal to d, meaning that the list c is not sorted, then b is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It processes each list by splitting numbers greater than 10 into two digits if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit and greater than or equal to the last element in the processed list, otherwise keeping the number as is. The function then checks if the processed list is sorted and appends 1 to the output list if it is, or 0 if it is not. The function returns a list of these results, one for each test case.
