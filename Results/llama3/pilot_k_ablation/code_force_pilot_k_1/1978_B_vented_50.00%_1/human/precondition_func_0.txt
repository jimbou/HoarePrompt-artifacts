stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
