The code prints the integer value of the profit.
The profit is calculated as n times a plus (b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) minus (min(n - 1, b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) divided by 2, where n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, and a is less than b.
Output: **n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) // 2 (where n, a, and b are the values of n, a, and b respectively)**
