The code prints the value of `profit`, which is the product of `n` and `a`. Since `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the value of `profit` will be at least as large as the product of `n` and `b`.

Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a, and the value of profit which is the product of n and a is being printed**
