Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a.**

The code first reads a line of input from stdin and splits it into three integers, which are stored in the list x. The first element of x is assigned to n, the second element to a, and the third element to b. The variable profit is then calculated as the product of n and a. The value of t remains unchanged, but stdin now contains one less line of input.
