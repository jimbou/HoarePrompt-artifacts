The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers: n, a, and b. These values are assigned to the variables n, a, and b, respectively. The variable profit is then calculated as the product of n and a.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one (each containing three integers: n, a, and b), n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is an integer equal to n times a**
