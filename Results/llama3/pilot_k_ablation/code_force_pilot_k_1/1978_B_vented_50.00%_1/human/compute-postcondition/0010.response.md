Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is greater than or equal to b, the value of profit which is the product of n and a is being printed. If a is less than b, the profit is calculated as the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the profit is printed.***
