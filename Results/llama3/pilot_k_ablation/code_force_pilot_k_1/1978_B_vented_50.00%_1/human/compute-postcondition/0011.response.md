Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one (each containing three integers: n, a, and b), n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n times a is printed. If a is less than b, the profit which is equal to n times a plus (b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) minus (min(n - 1, b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) divided by 2 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing three integers: n, a, and b. The values of n, a, and b are still integers. The conditions for printing the profit remain the same.
