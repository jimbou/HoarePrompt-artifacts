Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is greater than or equal to b, the value of profit which is the product of n and a is being printed. If a is less than b, the profit is calculated as the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the profit is printed.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t lines of input, each containing three integers. The conditions for printing the profit are still the same.
