The code calculates the value of `k` as the minimum between `b - a` and `n - 1`, then updates the `profit` by adding the product of `b - a` and `k + 1`, and subtracting the sum of the first `k` positive integers.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and a is less than b**
