The code snippet calculates the maximum possible profit by considering the difference between the selling price `b` and the buying price `a`, and the number of items `n`. The first line calculates the difference between `b` and `a` and assigns it to `k`. The second line ensures that `k` is not greater than `n - 1`, which means we cannot sell more items than we have. The third line updates the profit by adding the profit from selling `k + 1` items at price `b`, and subtracting the cost of buying `k` items at price `a`, which is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one (each containing three integers: n, a, and b), n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is an integer equal to n times a plus (b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) minus (min(n - 1, b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) divided by 2, and a is less than b**
