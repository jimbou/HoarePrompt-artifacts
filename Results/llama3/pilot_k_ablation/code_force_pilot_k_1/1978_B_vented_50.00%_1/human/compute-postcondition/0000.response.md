The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains three integers, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (the number of test cases), stdin contains multiple test cases (each containing three integers: n, a, and b)**
