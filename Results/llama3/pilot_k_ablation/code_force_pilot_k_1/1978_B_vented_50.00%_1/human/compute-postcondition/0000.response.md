The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The input is consumed, so the remaining input will be the `t` lines containing three integers each.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing three integers.**
