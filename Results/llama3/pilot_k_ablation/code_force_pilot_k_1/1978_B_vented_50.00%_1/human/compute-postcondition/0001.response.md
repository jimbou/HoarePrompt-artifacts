According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which means `t` is not equal to 0. Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing three integers.**
