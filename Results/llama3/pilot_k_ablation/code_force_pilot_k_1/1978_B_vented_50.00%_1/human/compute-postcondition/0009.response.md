Output: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one (each containing three integers: n, a, and b), n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, profit is an integer equal to n times a plus (b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) minus (min(n - 1, b - a) times (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) divided by 2, and a is less than b, and the integer profit is printed**
