Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. It first calculates the profit if all buns are sold at the usual price. Then, it checks if the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price is greater than the usual price. If it is, it calculates the profit by selling the first k buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, in which case it simply sells all buns at the usual price. It also correctly handles the case where the number of buns is 1, in which case it sells the single bun at the modified price.

The program uses the correct formula to calculate the profit when selling the first k buns at the modified price, which is the sum of the arithmetic series (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.
