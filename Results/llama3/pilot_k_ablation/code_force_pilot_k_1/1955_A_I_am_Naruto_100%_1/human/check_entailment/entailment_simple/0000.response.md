Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over it using a `for` loop.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` representing the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
3. It calculates the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a` and stores it in `s1`.
4. It calculates the total cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price `b` and stores it in `s2`. The calculation is done by multiplying `b` by the integer division of `n` by 2 (i.e., the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price) and adding the cost of buying the remaining yogurt(s) at the regular price `a`.
5. It prints the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying yogurts based on the problem description. The use of integer division and modulo operations ensures that the program handles cases where `n` is odd or even correctly.

Correctness: **True**
