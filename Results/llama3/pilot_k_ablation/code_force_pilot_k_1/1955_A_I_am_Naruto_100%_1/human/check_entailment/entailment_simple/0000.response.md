Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes the number of test cases t as input, followed by t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b.

The program calculates two possible costs:

1. s1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price a.
2. s2: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price b, where the number of pairs of yogurts is calculated using integer division (n // 2), and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price a.

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using the min() function.

The program's logic is correct, as it considers both possible ways of buying yogurts and chooses the one with the minimum cost. The use of integer division (n // 2) ensures that the number of pairs of yogurts is correctly calculated, and the remainder (n % 2) is used to account for any remaining yogurt.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will match the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
