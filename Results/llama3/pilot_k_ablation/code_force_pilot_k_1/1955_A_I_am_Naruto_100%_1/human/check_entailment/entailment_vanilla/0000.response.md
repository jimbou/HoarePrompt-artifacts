Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that contains the main logic.
2. The function iterates over a range of test cases, where the number of test cases is provided as input.
3. For each test case, the program reads three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price of one yogurt), and `b` (the price of two yogurts on promotion).
4. The program calculates two possible costs:
   - `s1`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`).
   - `s2`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price (`b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`). This calculation takes into account the fact that buying two yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous when `n` is even.
5. The program prints the minimum cost between `s1` and `s2` using the `min()` function.

Based on the problem description and the provided example inputs and outputs, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
