Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka" store, where the price of one yogurt is a burles, and there is a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

2. The given Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

3. The program calculates two possible costs:
   - s1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
   - s2: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion (b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a). This calculation takes into account the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (n // 2), and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price (n % 2 * a).

4. The program then prints the minimum cost between s1 and s2 for each test case.

5. The program correctly handles the cases where n is even or odd, and it correctly calculates the minimum cost in both scenarios.

6. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
