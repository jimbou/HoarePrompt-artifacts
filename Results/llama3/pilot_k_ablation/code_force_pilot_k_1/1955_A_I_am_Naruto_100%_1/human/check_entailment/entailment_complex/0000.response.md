Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes the number of test cases (t) as input, followed by t lines of input, each containing three integers (n, a, b).

The program calculates two values, s1 and s2, for each test case. s1 represents the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a), while s2 represents the total cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price (b) for as many pairs of yogurts as possible, and the regular price (a) for any remaining yogurts.

The program then prints the minimum of s1 and s2 for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it considers both possible scenarios for buying yogurts (regular price and promotion price) and chooses the one that results in the minimum total cost.

Correctness: **True**
