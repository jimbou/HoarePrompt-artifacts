Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the three integers n, a, and b, which represent the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
3. It calculates two sums: s1, the product of n and a (representing the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price), and s2, the sum of the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 (representing the cost of buying n/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price) and the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2 (representing the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price).
4. It prints the minimum of these two sums, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the different cases where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous than buying them at the regular price, and vice versa.

Correctness: **True**
