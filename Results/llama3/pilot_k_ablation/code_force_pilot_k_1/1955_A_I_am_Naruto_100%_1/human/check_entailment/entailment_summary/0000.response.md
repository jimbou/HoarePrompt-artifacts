Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program calculates two possible costs: s1, which is the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (n * a), and s2, which is the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (b * (n // 2)) plus the cost of any remaining yogurt at the regular price (n % 2 * a). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is even or odd, and it correctly calculates the minimum cost in both scenarios. The use of the min function ensures that the program always prints the minimum cost, regardless of whether buying in pairs or individually is more advantageous.

Correctness: **True**
