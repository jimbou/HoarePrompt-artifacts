Output State: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, s1 is an integer equal to n times a, s2 is an integer equal to b times the integer division of n by 2 plus a times the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains at least 1 line of input**

The code first reads three integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. Then, it calculates `s1` as the product of `n` and `a`, and `s2` as the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2, plus the product of `a` and the remainder of `n` divided by 2. The remaining lines in stdin are not affected by the code.
