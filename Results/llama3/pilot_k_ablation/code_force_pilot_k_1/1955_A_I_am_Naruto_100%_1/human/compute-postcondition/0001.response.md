The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the values of three inputs from stdin to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since stdin contains at least 1 input, after this line, stdin will be empty. The second line assigns the value of `n * a` to `s1`. The third line assigns the value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` to `s2`. The fourth line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the sum of the product of b and the integer division of n by 2, and the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, _ is 0, t is at least 1, stdin is empty**
