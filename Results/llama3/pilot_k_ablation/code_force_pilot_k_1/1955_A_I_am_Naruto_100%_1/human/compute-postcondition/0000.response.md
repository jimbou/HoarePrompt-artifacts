To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least one input, the loop can execute. Since `stdin` contains `t+1` inputs, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 input, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1**
