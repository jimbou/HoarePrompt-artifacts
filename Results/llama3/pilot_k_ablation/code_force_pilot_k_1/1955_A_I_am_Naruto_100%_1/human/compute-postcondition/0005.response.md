Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t), and each subsequent line contains three integers (n, a, b). For each test case, it calculates two values (s1 and s2) based on the input integers and prints the minimum of these two values. The function repeats this process t times, printing the minimum value for each test case.**
