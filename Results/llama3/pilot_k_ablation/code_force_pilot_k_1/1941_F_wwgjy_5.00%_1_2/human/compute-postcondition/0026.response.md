Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last values read from `stdin`, `a` is the last list of integers read from `stdin`, `b` is the last sorted list of integers read from `stdin`, `f` is the last sorted list of integers read from `stdin`, `gap` is the last sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` and `end` are the last integers representing the start and end of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the last integer representing the middle of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the last integer representing the second-largest gap in `a` (or 0 if there is only one gap), `res` is the last minimum of its initial value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all `s` that are within the range of `start` and `end`, `remain` is the last integer equal to `mid` minus the last element of `b`, `j` is the last integer representing the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `i` is the last value of `m-1`.**
