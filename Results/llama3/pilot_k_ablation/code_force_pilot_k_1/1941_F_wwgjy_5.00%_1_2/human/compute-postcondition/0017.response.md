Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` and `end` are integers representing the start and end of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is an integer representing the middle of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is an integer representing the second-largest gap in `a` (or 0 if there is only one gap), `res` is either still infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is an integer representing the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four lines of input, and if `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration, otherwise `j` is not equal to `k` and `s` is an integer equal to the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is updated to be within the range of `start` and `end` if `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.***
