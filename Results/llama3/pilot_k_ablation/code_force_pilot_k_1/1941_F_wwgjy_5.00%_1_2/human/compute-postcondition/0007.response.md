Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start and end are integers representing the start and end of the largest gap in a, mid is an integer representing the middle of the largest gap in a, nd is an integer representing the second-largest gap in a (or 0 if there is only one gap), res is still infinity, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the ith element of b, j is an integer representing the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four lines of input, j is not equal to k, and s is an integer equal to the sum of the jth element of f and the ith element of b.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable s, which is the sum of the jth element of the sorted list f and the ith element of the sorted list b. All other variables remain unchanged.
