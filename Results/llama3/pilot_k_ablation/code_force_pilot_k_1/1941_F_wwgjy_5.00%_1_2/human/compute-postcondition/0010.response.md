Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` and `end` are integers representing the start and end of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is an integer representing the middle of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is an integer representing the second-largest gap in `a` (or 0 if there is only one gap), `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is an integer representing the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four lines of input, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is an integer equal to the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`.***
