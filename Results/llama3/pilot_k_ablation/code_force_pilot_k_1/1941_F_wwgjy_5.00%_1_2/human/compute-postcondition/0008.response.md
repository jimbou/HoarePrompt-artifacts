Postcondition: **n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start and end are integers representing the start and end of the largest gap in a, mid is an integer representing the middle of the largest gap in a, nd is an integer representing the second-largest gap in a (or 0 if there is only one gap), res is still infinity, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the ith element of b, j is an integer representing the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four lines of input, j is not equal to k, and s is an integer equal to the sum of the jth element of f and the ith element of b. The current value of s is greater than start and less than end.**
