Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` and `end` are integers representing the start and end of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is an integer representing the middle of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is an integer representing the second-largest gap in `a` (or 0 if there is only one gap), `res` is the minimum of its initial value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all `s` that are within the range of `start` and `end`, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the last element of `b`, `j` is an integer representing the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `i` is `m-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m` lines of input. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the `gap` list which is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `res` which is the minimum of its initial value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all `s` that are within the range of `start` and `end` is being printed.***
