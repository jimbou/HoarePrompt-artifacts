Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines. It then processes each test case by finding the largest gap in the first list of integers, sorting the second and third lists, and calculating the minimum distance between the middle of the largest gap and the sum of an element from the second list and an element from the third list that falls within the largest gap. If no such sum exists, it prints the size of the largest gap. The function repeats this process for all test cases, emptying the standard input in the process.**
