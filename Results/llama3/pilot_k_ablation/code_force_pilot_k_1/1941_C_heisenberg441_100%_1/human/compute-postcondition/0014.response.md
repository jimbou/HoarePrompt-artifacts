Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `s`. If the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 5 is 'mapie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 5 is not 'mapie', then one of the following cases occurs: if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is 'map', then `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, and the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 2 is 'ie'. If the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. If the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
