The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1 and then increments the value of `i` by 5. Since `ans` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The value of `i` was initially 0, so it becomes 5. The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The value of `s` from index `i` to `i+5` is no longer 'mapie' because `i` has changed.

Output State: **ans is 1, i is 5, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length is greater than 0, n is the length of s.**
