Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `s`. If the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. In both cases, the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie', and the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'map'.***
