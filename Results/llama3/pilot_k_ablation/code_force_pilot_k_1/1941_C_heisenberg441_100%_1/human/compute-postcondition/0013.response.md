Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s`, and the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+5` is not equal to 'mapie'. If the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is 'map', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. If the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
