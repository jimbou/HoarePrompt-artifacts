Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+5` is not equal to 'mapie', the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is not equal to 'map', and the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is not equal to 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the substrings of `s` are still valid, as the increment of `i` does not affect the substrings that were previously checked.
