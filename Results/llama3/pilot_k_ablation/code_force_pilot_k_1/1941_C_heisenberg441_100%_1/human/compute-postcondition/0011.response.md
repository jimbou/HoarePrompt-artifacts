Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`. The substring of `s` starting from index `i-1` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie'. The substring of `s` starting from index `i-1` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'map'. The substring of `s` starting from index `i-1` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'pie'**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The other variables are not affected by the code. The conditions about the substrings of `s` starting from index `i` are still valid, but now they refer to the index `i-1` because `i` has been incremented.
