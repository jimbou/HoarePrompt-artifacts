According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is at least 1. Therefore, `n` is at least 1, which ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

No adjustments are needed to the states of `s`, `ans`, `i`, or `n` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`**
