Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length is greater than 0, ans is 1, i is 3, n is the length of s. The substring of s starting from index i and having a length of 2 is 'ie'.**

Explanation:
The first line increments the value of `ans` by 1, making it 1. The second line increments the value of `i` by 3, making it 3. Since `i` was initially 0, the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 was 'map'. After incrementing `i` by 3, the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 2 is 'ie'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `s`, which is not modified by the code.
