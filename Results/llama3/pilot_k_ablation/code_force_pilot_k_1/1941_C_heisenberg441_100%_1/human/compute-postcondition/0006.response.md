Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, ans is 1, i is 3, n is the length of s, the substring of s from index i to i+5 is not equal to 'mapie', and the current value of the substring of s from index i to i+3 is not 'map' but the substring of s from index i-3 to i was 'map'.**

The first line increments `ans` by 1, making it 1. The second line increments `i` by 3, making it 3. Since `i` was initially 0, the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` was 'map', but after incrementing `i` by 3, this substring is no longer 'map'. The substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+5` is still not equal to 'mapie'. The length of `s`, `n`, remains unchanged.
