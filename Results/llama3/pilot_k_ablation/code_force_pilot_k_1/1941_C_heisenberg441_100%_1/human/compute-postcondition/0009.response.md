Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `s`. The substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie'. The substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'map'. The current value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The substring of `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is no longer defined because `i` has been incremented.
