Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `s`, the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+5` is not equal to 'mapie', the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is not equal to 'map', and the current value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is not defined.**

The code increments `ans` by 1, making it 1, and increments `i` by 3, making it 3. The value of `s` and `n` remains unchanged. The substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+5` is still not equal to 'mapie', and the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is still not equal to 'map'. However, the current value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to `i+3` is no longer defined, as the index `i` has moved 3 positions forward.
