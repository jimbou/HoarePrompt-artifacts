Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string `s` beautiful. It does this by iterating over the string and checking for non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie'. For each occurrence, it increments the count `ans` by 1 and moves the index `i` to the end of the occurrence. If no occurrence is found, it simply moves the index `i` to the next character.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie') by returning 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where the string contains overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie'. For example, in the string "mapmap", the program will correctly count 2 occurrences of 'map' and return 2.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because it only needs to iterate over the string once.

Correctness: **True**
