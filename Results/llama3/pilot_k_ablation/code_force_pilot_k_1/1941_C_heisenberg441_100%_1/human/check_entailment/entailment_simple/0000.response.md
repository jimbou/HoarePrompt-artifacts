Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function uses a while loop to iterate over the characters in the string `s`. It checks for the presence of the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" in the string and increments the `ans` variable by 1 for each occurrence. The loop also increments the index `i` by the length of the matched substring.

After the loop, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct. The function correctly identifies the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" in the input string and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The program does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings correctly. For example, if the input string is "mapiepie", the program will count the "mapie" and "pie" substrings separately, resulting in an incorrect count.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings correctly. One possible solution is to use a sliding window approach to iterate over the characters in the string and check for the presence of the substrings.

Correctness: **False**
