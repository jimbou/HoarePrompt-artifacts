Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program checks for non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in the string and increments the count accordingly. The count is then returned as the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain any of the substrings 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie'). In this case, the program returns 0, which is the correct output.

The execution summary also confirms that the program works as expected, counting the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in the given string.

Correctness: **True**
