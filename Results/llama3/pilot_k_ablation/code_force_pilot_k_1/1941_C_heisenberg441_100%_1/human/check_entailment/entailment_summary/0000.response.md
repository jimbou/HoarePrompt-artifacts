Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program checks for non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in the string and increments the count whenever it finds any of these substrings. This is in line with the problem description, which requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
