Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly identifies the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" as the ones that make a string ugly.
2. The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string, checking for these substrings.
3. If a substring is found, the program increments the count `ans` and moves the index `i` to the end of the found substring. This ensures that the program doesn't count overlapping occurrences.
4. If no substring is found, the program simply moves the index `i` to the next character.
5. The program returns the count `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of a while loop and the careful handling of the index `i` ensure that the program doesn't miss any occurrences of the substrings or count overlapping occurrences.

Correctness: **True**
