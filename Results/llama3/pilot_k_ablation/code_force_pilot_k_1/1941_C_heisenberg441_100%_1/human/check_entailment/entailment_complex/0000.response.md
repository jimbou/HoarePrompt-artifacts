Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in a given string of lowercase Latin letters. The program iterates through the string, checking for the presence of these substrings and incrementing the count whenever it finds one. The program also correctly handles overlapping substrings by moving the index `i` forward by the length of the matched substring.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. The problem statement requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful, which is equivalent to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in the string. The program correctly calculates this count and returns it.

Correctness: **True**
