Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the substrings "pie" and "map" in the input string and counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program uses a while loop to iterate through the input string, checking for the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" at each position. If any of these substrings are found, the program increments the count of characters to be deleted and moves the index forward by the length of the substring. If none of these substrings are found, the program simply moves the index forward by 1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings that contain the substring "mapie"
* Strings that contain the substring "map"
* Strings that contain the substring "pie"
* Strings that do not contain any of these substrings
* Strings that contain multiple occurrences of these substrings
* Strings of length 1 (as shown in the example input)

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as strings that start or end with the substrings "map" or "pie".

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible input strings.
