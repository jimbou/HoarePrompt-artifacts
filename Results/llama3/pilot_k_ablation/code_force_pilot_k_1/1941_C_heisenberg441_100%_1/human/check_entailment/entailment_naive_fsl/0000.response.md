Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program checks for the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" and increments the count whenever it finds any of these substrings. The program also handles the case where the string does not contain any of these substrings by returning 0.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over the string, and it correctly updates the index `i` based on the length of the substring found. This ensures that the program does not miss any substrings or count any substring multiple times.

The program also handles the edge case where the string is already beautiful by returning 0.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
