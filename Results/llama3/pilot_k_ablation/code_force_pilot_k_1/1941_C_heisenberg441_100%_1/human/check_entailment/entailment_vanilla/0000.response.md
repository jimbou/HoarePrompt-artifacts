Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function uses a while loop to iterate over the characters in the string. It checks for the presence of the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" at the current position `i` in the string. If any of these substrings are found, it increments the count `ans` by 1 and moves the position `i` to the end of the matched substring. If none of these substrings are found, it simply moves the position `i` to the next character.

The function returns the count `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the returned value.

Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the substrings "pie" and "map" and increments the count accordingly. It also handles the case where the string does not contain these substrings.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1(s)` does not handle the case where the string contains overlapping substrings. For example, if the string is "mapiepie", the function will count the "mapie" substring twice, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the function can be modified to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a sliding window or a dynamic programming approach, to handle overlapping substrings correctly.

Correctness: **False**
