Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program uses a function `func_1(s)` that iterates over the input string `s`. It checks for the presence of the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" at each position `i` in the string. If any of these substrings are found, it increments the count `ans` by 1 and moves the index `i` forward by the length of the matched substring. If none of these substrings are found, it simply moves the index `i` forward by 1.

The program then prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program correctly handles the cases where the string contains multiple occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map", and it also correctly handles the case where the string does not contain any of these substrings.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
