Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k, d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 1, h is 0, p is equal to i, g is the sum of the first i terms of the sequence ((n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 4, (n + 1) // 8, ...), f is k - g, y is 2, and 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 times k minus 1 is being printed.**
