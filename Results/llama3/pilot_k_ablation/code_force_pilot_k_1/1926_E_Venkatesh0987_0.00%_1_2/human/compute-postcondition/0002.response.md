Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). The current value of k is greater than half of n plus one divided by two.**
