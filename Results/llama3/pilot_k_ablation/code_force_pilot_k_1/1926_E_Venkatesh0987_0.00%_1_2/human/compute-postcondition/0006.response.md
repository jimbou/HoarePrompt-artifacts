To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `s` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `d` is 0
- `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to be greater than or equal to `k`
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `_` is 0
- stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^9)

The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the condition `p <= i - 1`.

Since `p` is 1, for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. This is because if `i` were 1, `i - 1` would be 0, and `p` (being 1) would not be less than or equal to 0, thus not satisfying the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `i` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^9)**
