Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is (d + 1) // 2, i is 1, d is (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `d + 1` by 2. The value of `d` has been updated to `(d + 1) // 2`, effectively reducing its value by half. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
