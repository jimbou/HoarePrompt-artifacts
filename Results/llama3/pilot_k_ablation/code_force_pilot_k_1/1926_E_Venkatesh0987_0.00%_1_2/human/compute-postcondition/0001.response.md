Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The values of `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges. The code then initializes several variables: `s` is set to 0, `i` is set to 0, `d` is set to the value of `n`, `h` is set to the value of `n`, `p` is set to 1, and `g` is set to 0. The variable `_` is not modified and remains 0. After executing the code, the input stream `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, as one line has been read.
