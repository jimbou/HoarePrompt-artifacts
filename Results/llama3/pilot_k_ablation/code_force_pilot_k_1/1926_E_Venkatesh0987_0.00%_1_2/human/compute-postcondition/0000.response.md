The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed, `int(input())` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
