Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It lays down the cards in the specified order, first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then the cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

The program uses a while loop to calculate the number of cards in each group and then calculates the k-th card based on the group it belongs to. The program handles the case where k is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards correctly by subtracting the number of odd-numbered cards from k and then calculating the k-th card in the next group.

The program also handles the case where k is less than or equal to the number of odd-numbered cards correctly by simply printing 2*k - 1, which is the k-th odd-numbered card.

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It correctly handles the cases where n and k are large, and it correctly handles the cases where k is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
