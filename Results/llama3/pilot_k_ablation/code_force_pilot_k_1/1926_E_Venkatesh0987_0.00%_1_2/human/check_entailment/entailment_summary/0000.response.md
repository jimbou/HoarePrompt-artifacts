Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

The program first checks if k is greater than half of n. If it is, it calculates the number of iterations required to reach k by repeatedly subtracting half of the remaining numbers from the total count. It then calculates the actual value of the k-th card by multiplying the result of the last iteration by 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations minus 1.

If k is less than or equal to half of n, the program directly calculates the k-th card by multiplying 2 by k and subtracting 1.

The program handles all test cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
