This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to reach a target value k, either by performing a series of operations that reduce n by half or by directly calculating the result if k is less than or equal to half of n. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.
