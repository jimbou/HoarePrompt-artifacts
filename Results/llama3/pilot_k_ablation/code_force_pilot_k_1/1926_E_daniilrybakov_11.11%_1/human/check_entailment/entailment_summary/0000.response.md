Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the position of the card `k`.
3.  It initializes `n_back` to `n`, `s` to `(n + 1) // 2` (the number of odd numbers in the range `[1, n]`), and `n` to `(n + 1) // 2` (the number of odd numbers in the range `[1, n]`).
4.  It initializes `m` to 1, which represents the multiplier for the current sequence of numbers (initially, it's the sequence of odd numbers).
5.  The program then enters a while loop that continues until `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.
6.  Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is 0. If `n` is 0, it means that the current sequence of numbers has been exhausted, and it resets `s` to `n_back` and `n` to 1.
7.  If `n` is not 0, it updates `m` by multiplying it by 2 (since the next sequence of numbers will be twice the previous sequence), and it updates `n` by dividing it by 2 (since the next sequence of numbers will have half the number of elements as the previous sequence).
8.  It then updates `s` by adding `n` to it (since the next sequence of numbers will add `n` elements to the total count).
9.  Once the loop exits, it calculates the `k`-th card by using the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`. This formula works by first calculating the position of the `k`-th card within the current sequence of numbers, and then multiplying it by the current multiplier `m` to get the actual value of the `k`-th card.
10. Finally, it prints the calculated result.
