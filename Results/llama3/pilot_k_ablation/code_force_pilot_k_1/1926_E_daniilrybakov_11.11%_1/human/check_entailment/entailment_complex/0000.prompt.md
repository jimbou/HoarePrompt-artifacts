Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        n_back = n
        
        s = (n + 1) // 2
        
        n = (n + 1) // 2
        
        m = 1
        
        while s < k:
            if n == 0:
                s = n_back
                n = 1
                break
            m *= 2
            n //= 2
            s += n
        
        print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n_back` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `s` is equal to `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive) divided by 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, `m` is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, stdin is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). It then performs calculations based on these inputs and prints the results. The function iteratively updates the values of n, s, and m until s is equal to k, and then prints the calculated result. The function does not modify the input variables and leaves stdin empty after execution.
