Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the number of odd-numbered cards (`n`) and the total number of cards laid down so far (`s`).
2. The while loop correctly updates `n` and `s` based on the number of cards that are twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on.
3. The loop breaks when `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, which means we have found the correct group of cards that contains the `k`-th card.
4. The final calculation `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` correctly calculates the `k`-th card. Here's why:
	* `k - (s - n)` gives the position of the `k`-th card within the current group of cards.
	* `2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1` gives the actual value of the `k`-th card, since the cards are laid down in the order of odd numbers, twice odd numbers, three times odd numbers, and so on.
	* Multiplying by `m` (which is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed) gives the correct value of the `k`-th card, since the cards are laid down in the order of odd numbers, twice odd numbers, three times odd numbers, and so on.

Correctness: **True**
