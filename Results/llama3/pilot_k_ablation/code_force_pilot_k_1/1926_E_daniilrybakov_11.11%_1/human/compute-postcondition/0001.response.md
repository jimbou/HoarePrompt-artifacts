To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop executes.

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`**
