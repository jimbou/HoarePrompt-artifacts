To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution) and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
