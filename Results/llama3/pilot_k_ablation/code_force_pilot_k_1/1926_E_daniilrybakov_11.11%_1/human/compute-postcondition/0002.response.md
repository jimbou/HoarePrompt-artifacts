Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n_back is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), s is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive), m is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing one integer k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**

The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the first line of stdin, assigns `n` to `n_back`, calculates `s` as the ceiling of `n` divided by 2, updates `n` to be the ceiling of `n` divided by 2, and sets `m` to 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is not stored in any variable, so it is not included in the output state. The remaining lines in stdin are not affected by the code and still contain one integer `k` each.
