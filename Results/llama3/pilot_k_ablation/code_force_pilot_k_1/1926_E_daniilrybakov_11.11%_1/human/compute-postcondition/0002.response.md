Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), n_back is an integer, s is an integer, n is an integer, m is 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k**

The code snippet reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from stdin and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. It then calculates the value of `s` as the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The value of `n` is also updated to be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. Finally, the variable `m` is assigned the value 1.

The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n_back` is set to the original value of `n` before it is updated. The values of `s` and `n` are calculated based on the original value of `n`. The value of `m` is set to 1. The stdin now contains `t-1` pairs of integers `n` and `k`, as one pair has been read and processed.
