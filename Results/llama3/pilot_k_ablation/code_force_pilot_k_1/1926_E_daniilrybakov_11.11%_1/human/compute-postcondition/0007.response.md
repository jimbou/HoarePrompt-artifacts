Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n_back is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), s is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive) plus n divided by 2, n is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive) divided by 2, m is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing one integer k (1 <= k <= 10^9 and k is greater than s). If n is 0, then s is equal to n_back, n is 1, and m is 1. Otherwise, the values of t, n_back, s, n, and m remain unchanged.**
