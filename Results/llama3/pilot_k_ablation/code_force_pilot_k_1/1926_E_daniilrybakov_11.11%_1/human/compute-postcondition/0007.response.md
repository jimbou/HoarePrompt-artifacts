Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), n_back is an integer, s is an integer and s is less than k, n is an integer, m is 2, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k. If n is 0, then s is equal to n_back, n is 0, and stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k. Otherwise, s is equal to s + n/2, n is n/2, and stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k.**

In this output state, the value of m has been doubled to 2. The value of n has been halved. The value of s has been incremented by the new value of n. The values of t, n_back, and stdin remain unchanged. If n was initially 0, then s is now equal to n_back, and n is still 0. Otherwise, s has been incremented by half of its original value, and n has been halved.
