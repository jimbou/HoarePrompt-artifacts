Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n_back` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `s` is equal to `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive) divided by 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, `m` is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing one integer `k` (1 <= k <= 10^9 and k is greater than or equal to `s`). If `n` is 0, then `s` is equal to `n_back`, `n` is 1, and `m` is 1.**
