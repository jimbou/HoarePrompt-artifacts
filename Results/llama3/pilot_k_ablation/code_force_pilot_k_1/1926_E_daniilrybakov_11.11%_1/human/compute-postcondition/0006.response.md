Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n_back` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `s` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 (inclusive), `m` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing one integer `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9 and `k` is greater than `s`). If `n` is 0, then `s` is equal to `n_back`, `n` is 1, and `m` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n_back`, `s`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.***
