Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), n_back is an integer, s is an integer and s is less than k, n is an integer, m is 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k. If n is 0, then s is equal to n_back, n is 1, and stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
