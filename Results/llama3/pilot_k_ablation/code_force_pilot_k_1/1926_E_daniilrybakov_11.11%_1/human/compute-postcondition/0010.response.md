Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), n_back is an integer, s is greater than or equal to k, n is an integer, m is a power of 2, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k. If n is 0, then s is equal to n_back, n is 0, and stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is the second integer in the pair, s is greater than or equal to k, n is the first integer in the pair, and m is a power of 2**
