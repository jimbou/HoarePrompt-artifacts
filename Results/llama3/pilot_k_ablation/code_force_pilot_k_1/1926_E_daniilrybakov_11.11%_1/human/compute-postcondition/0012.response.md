Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). It then performs calculations based on these inputs and prints the results. The function iteratively updates the values of n, s, and m until s is equal to k, and then prints the calculated result. The function does not modify the input variables and leaves stdin empty after execution.**
