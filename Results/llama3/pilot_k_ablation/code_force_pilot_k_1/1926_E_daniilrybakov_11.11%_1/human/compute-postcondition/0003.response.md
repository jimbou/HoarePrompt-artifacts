The only variables in the loop head are variables `s` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is an integer, `k` is an integer. `s` and `k` being integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `s` is less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), n_back is an integer, s is an integer and s is less than k, n is an integer, m is 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k**
