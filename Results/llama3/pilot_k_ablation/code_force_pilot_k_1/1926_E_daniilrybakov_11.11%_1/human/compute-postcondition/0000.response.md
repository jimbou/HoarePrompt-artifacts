The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains `t+1` inputs: first an integer `t` and then `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`. Since `t` is assigned the first input, the remaining inputs in the stdin are `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`**
