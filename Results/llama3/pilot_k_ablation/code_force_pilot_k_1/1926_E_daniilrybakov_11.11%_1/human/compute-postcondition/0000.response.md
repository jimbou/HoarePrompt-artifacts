The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first line of the input to the variable `t`, where `input()` accepts a line of input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4). Therefore, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**
