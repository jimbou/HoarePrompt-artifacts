The function reads a series of input pairs from stdin, where each pair consists of two integers, n and k. It then calculates and prints a value for each pair, based on a series of mathematical operations involving n and k. The function continues this process until all input pairs have been processed, at which point stdin is empty and the function has printed a corresponding number of output lines.
