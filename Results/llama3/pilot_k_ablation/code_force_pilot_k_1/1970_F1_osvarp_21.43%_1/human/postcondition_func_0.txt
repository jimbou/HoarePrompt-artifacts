This function simulates a game where two teams, 'B' and 'W', compete to score points by moving players and the ball ('.B') around a grid. The game consists of a series of commands read from standard input, each representing a move or action. The function processes these commands, updating the game state accordingly. It eliminates players who collide with the ball or each other, scores goals when the ball reaches a goal position, and awards points for catching the golden snitch. The game ends after all commands have been processed, and the final score is printed to the console.
