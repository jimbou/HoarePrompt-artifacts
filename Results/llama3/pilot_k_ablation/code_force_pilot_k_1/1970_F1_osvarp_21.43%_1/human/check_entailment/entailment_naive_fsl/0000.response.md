Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the other team wins a point. However, the program does not check for this case and instead awards the point to the team that scored.

For example, if the input is:

3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T

The program will output:

4 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 0

However, according to the problem description, the correct output should be:

4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1

Because the red player scored in their own goal, the blue team should win a point.
