Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, in the program, the points are incremented based on the team of the player who scored, regardless of whether it was the correct or incorrect goal.

For example, if a red player scores in the red goal, the program will increment the red team's score, but according to the problem description, the blue team should win a point in this case.

To fix this, the program should check whether the player scored in the correct or incorrect goal and increment the points accordingly.
