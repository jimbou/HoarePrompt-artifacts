stdin contains multiple inputs: first two integers (n and m) separated by a space, then n lines of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, then an integer t, and then t lines each containing a command. The commands are either a pair of characters (obj and com) or a pair of characters and another pair of characters (obj, com, and el). The pair of characters obj represents an entity on the field, com represents the action to be performed, and el represents another entity on the field. The actions are either 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', 'C', or 'T'. The entities are either players (represented by 'R0' to 'R9' and 'B0' to 'B9'), goals (represented by 'RG' and 'BG'), or the Quaffle (represented by '.Q').
