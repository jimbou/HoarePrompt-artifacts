Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list of n lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, goal is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, points is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, stdin contains at least t-2 lines, i is n-1, t is an integer greater than 0, time is 0, comand is a list of strings read from the second line of stdin, obj is the first element of comand, com is the second element of comand, pos is the value of elements[obj], and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after moving in the direction specified by com.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `i`, `t`, and `time` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` is updated to contain at least `t-2` lines, as two lines have been read from `stdin` to populate the `comand` list. The `comand` list is updated to contain the first two elements of the second line of `stdin`. The `obj` and `com` variables are assigned the first and second elements of `comand`, respectively. The `pos` variable is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, which is the current position of the object `obj` in the grid. The `nxt` variable is assigned a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after moving in the direction specified by `com`, which is calculated by adding the movement values from the `mov` dictionary to the current position `pos`.
