Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lines each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in grid with their respective positions, allPlayers is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in grid with the value False, goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in grid and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in grid, points is a list containing two zeros, t is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing a command, time is 0, obj is a string representing an object, com is a string representing a command, pos is a tuple representing the position of obj, and nxt is a tuple representing the next position of obj.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `t`, and `time` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `stdin` now contains `t-3` lines as the first line has been read and processed. The `obj` and `com` variables are assigned the values from the first line of `stdin`, which is a command. The `pos` variable is assigned the position of the object `obj` from the `elements` dictionary. The `nxt` variable is calculated by adding the movement values from the `mov` dictionary to the current position `pos`.
