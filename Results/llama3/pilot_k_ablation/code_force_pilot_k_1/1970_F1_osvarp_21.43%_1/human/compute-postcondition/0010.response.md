Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lines each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the key line[ind] with the value (0, 0), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, points is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing a command, line is a line that must have at least 1 character, ind is 0, and the current value of line[ind] is not '..' and is not a player, and the second character of the current value of line[ind] is 'G', goal is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (0, ind).**

The code assigns a value to `tmp` based on the first character of `line[ind]`. If the first character is 'B', `tmp` becomes 0; otherwise, it becomes 1. Then, it appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the `tmp`-th list in `goal`. Since `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` becomes 1, and the tuple `(0, ind)` is appended to the second list in `goal`. No other variables are affected.
