Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lines each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value nxt and the keys of all non '..' elements in grid with their respective positions, allPlayers is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in grid with the value False, goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in grid and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in grid, points is a list containing two integers where the integer at index team is either 0 or 1 and the other integer is 0, t is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing a command, time is 0, obj is a string representing an object and is equal to '.B', com is a string representing a command, pos is a tuple representing the position of obj, and nxt is a tuple representing the next position of obj. If nxt is a player position, then player is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, nxt is not a player position. If com is 'T', the value of allPlayers[obj] is now False. If goalIn(pos) is not -1, the time which is 0 and the team name which is either 'B' or 'W' depending on the value of team which is either 0 or 1, followed by the string 'GOAL' is being printed. If com is not 'T', the command com is not equal to 'T'.***
