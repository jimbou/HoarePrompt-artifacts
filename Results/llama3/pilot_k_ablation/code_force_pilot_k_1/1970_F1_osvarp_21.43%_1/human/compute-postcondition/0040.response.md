Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid where the value of `obj` is set to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list of strings read from the second line of stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after moving in the direction specified by `com`, `team` is the value of `goalIn(pos)`, and either `obj` is not '.B' or the cell at the new position `nxt` is not occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player but the cell at the new position `nxt` is not occupied by '.B'.**

In this output state, the value of `team` has been updated to the value returned by the function `goalIn(pos)`, which is not -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
