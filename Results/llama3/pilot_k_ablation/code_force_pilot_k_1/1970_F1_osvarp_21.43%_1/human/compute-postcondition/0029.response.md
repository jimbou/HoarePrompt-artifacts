Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two values, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines each containing a command, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of the command from the first line of `stdin`, `com` is the second element of the command from the first line of `stdin`. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value False except for `obj` which is now True. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value False, and if `el` is '.S', then the current value of `el` is '.S' and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where `time` is 0 and `GoalName[team]` is the name of the team (either 'Blue' or 'White').***
