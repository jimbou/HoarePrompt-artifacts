Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lines each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in grid with their respective positions, allPlayers is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in grid with the value False, goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in grid and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in grid, points is a list containing two integers where the integer at index team is either 0 or 1 and the other integer is 0, t is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing a command, time is 0, obj is a string representing an object, com is a string representing a command, pos is a tuple representing the position of obj, and nxt is a tuple representing the next position of obj. If obj is '.B' and nxt is a player position or obj is a player and elements['.B'] is equal to nxt, then player is either obj if obj is a player or the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] if obj is '.B', and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, either obj is not '.B' or nxt is not a player position, and either obj is not a player or elements['.B'] is not equal to nxt. If com is 'T', the value of allPlayers[obj] is now False. If goalIn(pos) is not -1, the time which is 0 and the team name which is either 'B' or 'W' depending on the value of team which is either 0 or 1, followed by the string 'GOAL' is being printed. If com is not 'T', the command com is not equal to 'T'. If obj is a player, the position of obj is updated to nxt.***
