Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs ('.B': (0, 0), `line[ind]`: (i, ind)), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair (`line[ind]`: False) if `line[ind]` is a player, otherwise it is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is updated to include `line[ind]`: False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `elements` is updated to include 'G': (i, ind) and `goal` is updated to include (i, ind) in its second list. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
