Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the key `line[ind]` with the value (0, 0), `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains `t` lines each containing a command, `line` is a line that must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the key `line[ind]` with the value False. If `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (0, ind). Otherwise, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists and `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary.**
