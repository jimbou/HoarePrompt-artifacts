The code prints a string indicating the final score of the game, where the first value is the score of the first player (points[0]) and the second value is the score of the second player (points[1]). The values of points[0] and points[1] depend on the commands in stdin and the state of the game.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the scores of the first and second players respectively, based on the commands in stdin and the state of the game)**
