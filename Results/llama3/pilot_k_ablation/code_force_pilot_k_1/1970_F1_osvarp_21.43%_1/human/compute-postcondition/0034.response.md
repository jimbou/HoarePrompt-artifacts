The code prints a formatted string indicating the time and the player that has been eliminated. The time is represented by the value of the variable `time`, which is 0. The player is represented by the value of the variable `player`, which is either the current value of `obj` if it is a player or the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is '.B'.

Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is either the current value of obj if it is a player or the value of grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] if obj is '.B')**
