Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value False except for `obj` which is now True, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines each containing a command, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of the command from the first line of `stdin`, `com` is the second element of the command from the first line of `stdin`, and the current value of `el` is '.Q'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `allPlayers[obj]` has been updated to True, indicating that the player represented by `obj` is now active. All other variables remain unchanged, including the grid, elements, goal, points, time, and stdin.
