The code prints a string indicating the final score of the game, where the score of the first player is the first element of the `points` list and the score of the second player is the second element of the `points` list.
Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two values, `t` is an integer, `stdin` is empty, `time` is `t-1`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value True if the player has caught the Golden Snitch, False otherwise. The values of `elements`, `points`, and `allPlayers` depend on the commands in `stdin`, and this is printed: 'FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]'**
