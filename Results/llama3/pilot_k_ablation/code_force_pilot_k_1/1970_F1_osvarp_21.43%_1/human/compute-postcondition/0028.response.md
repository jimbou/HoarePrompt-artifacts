Postcondition: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first string of the second line of stdin, `com` is the second string of the second line of stdin, and `el` is the third string of the second line of stdin. If `el` is '.S', then the first element of `points` is 0 and the second element is 10, and '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed where time is 0 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that caught the golden snitch. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
