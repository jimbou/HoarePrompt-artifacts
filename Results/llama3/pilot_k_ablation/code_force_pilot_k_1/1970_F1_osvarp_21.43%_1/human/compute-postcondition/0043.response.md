Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value False, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two integers where the integer at index `team` is 1 and the other integer is 0, `t` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines each containing a command, time is 0, `obj` is a string representing an object, `com` is a string representing a command and its current value is 'T', `pos` is a tuple representing the position of `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple representing the next position of `obj`, `team` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `pos` is in the first or second list of `goal`, and either `obj` is not '.B' or `nxt` is not a player position, and either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. The value of `allPlayers[obj]` is now False. The time which is 0 and the team name which is either 'B' or 'W' depending on the value of `team` which is either 0 or 1, followed by the string 'GOAL' is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of points for the team that scored a goal has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The team that scored the goal is either 'B' or 'W' depending on the value of `team`, and the time is still 0. The team name followed by 'GOAL' is being printed.
