Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value False, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines each containing a command, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of the command from the first line of `stdin`, `com` is the second element of the command from the first line of `stdin`, and `el` is the third element of the command from the first line of `stdin`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `t`, and `time` remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is updated to contain `t-3` lines each containing a command, as the first line has been processed. The variables `obj`, `com`, and `el` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third elements of the command from the first line of `stdin`, respectively.
