Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first string of the second line of stdin, `com` is the second string of the second line of stdin, and `el` is the third string of the second line of stdin.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `i`, `t`, and `time` remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains at least `t-2` lines, since one line was read to assign values to `obj`, `com`, and `el`. The variables `obj`, `com`, and `el` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third strings of the second line of stdin, respectively.
