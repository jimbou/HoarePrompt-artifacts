Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value `(0, 0)` and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, where the position of `obj` is updated to `nxt`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines each containing a command, `time` is 0, `obj` is a string representing a player, `com` is a string representing a command, `pos` is a tuple representing the position of `obj`, and `nxt` is a tuple representing the next position of `obj`, where either `obj` is not '.B' or `nxt` is not a player position, and either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. The command `com` is not equal to 'T'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The position of the object `obj` in the `elements` dictionary is updated to `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged. The grid, all players, goal positions, points, and other variables are still the same. The only change is the updated position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
