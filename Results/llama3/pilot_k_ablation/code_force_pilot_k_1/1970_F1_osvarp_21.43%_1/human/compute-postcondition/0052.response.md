Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, `stdin` contains at least t-2 lines, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list of strings read from the second line of stdin, `obj` is '.B', `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after moving in the direction specified by `com`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `stdin`, `i`, `t`, `time`, `comand`, `obj`, `com`, and `pos` remain the same. The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, which is the new position of `obj` after moving in the direction specified by `com`.
