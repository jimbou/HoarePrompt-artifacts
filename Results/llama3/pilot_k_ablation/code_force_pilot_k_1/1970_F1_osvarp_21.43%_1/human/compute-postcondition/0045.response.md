Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list of n lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, goal is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, points is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, stdin contains at least t-2 lines, i is n-1, t is an integer greater than 0, time is 0, comand is a list of strings read from the second line of stdin, obj is the first element of comand, com is the second element of comand, pos is the value of elements[obj], and nxt is a tuple containing the new position of obj after moving in the direction specified by com. Either obj is not '.B' or the cell at the new position nxt is not occupied by a player, or obj is a player but the cell at the new position nxt is not occupied by '.B'. The command is not 'T'.***
