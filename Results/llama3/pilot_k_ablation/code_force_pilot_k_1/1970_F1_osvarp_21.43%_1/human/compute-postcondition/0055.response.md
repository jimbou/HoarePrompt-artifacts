Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `time` is t-1, `comand` is a list of strings read from the last line of stdin. If `comand` has exactly 3 elements, then `obj` is the first string of the last line of stdin, `com` is the second string of the last line of stdin, and `el` is the third string of the last line of stdin. If `el` is '.Q', then the value of `obj` is set to True. If `el` is '.S', then the first element of `points` is 0 and the second element is 10, and '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed where time is t-1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that caught the golden snitch. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `comand` does not have exactly 3 elements, then `obj` is either '.B' or a player, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after moving in the direction specified by `com`. If `obj` is '.B' and the cell at the new position `nxt` is occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player and the cell at the new position `nxt` is occupied by '.B', then the player is eliminated and "time is t-1 and player is eliminated" is printed. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', the value of `obj` in `allPlayers` is set to False and if the goal is scored, '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed where time is t-1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal of the team that scored, which is either 'B' or 'W', and the element at index team in points is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T', if `obj` is a player, then the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
