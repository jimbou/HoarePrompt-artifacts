The code prints the current time and the name of the goal that has been scored, depending on the team that scored the goal.

The value of `time` is 0, as specified in the initial state.

The value of `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`, which is either 0 or 1. Since `team` is determined by whether `pos` is in the first or second list of `goal`, we can't determine the exact value of `GoalName[team]` without knowing the contents of `goal`. However, we can describe it as the name of the goal that has been scored by the team that scored the goal.

Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where GoalName[team] is the name of the goal scored by the team that scored the goal)**
