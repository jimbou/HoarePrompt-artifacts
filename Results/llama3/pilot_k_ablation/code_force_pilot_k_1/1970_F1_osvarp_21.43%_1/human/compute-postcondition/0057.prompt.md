You will be given an **initial state** (precondition) and a **Python code snippet** containing a `print` statement. Your task is to calculate the postcondition, by enhancing the precondition with what is being printed.

If a variable or object has a known **explicit value**, use that value in the output.
If a variable or object is defined by a **formula or condition**, describe its value using the given information.
Always provide the most **precise** description possible based on the precondition.
Format the final output as:  Output: **the postcondition including what is being printed**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task:


Example1:
Initial State: `arr` is a list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 'sum' is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`
```
print(arr[2], sum)
```
Example Answer:
The code prints the element at index 2 of the list `arr` which is 3, and the value of `sum` which is the sum of all elements in the list `arr` which is 15.
Output: **`arr` is a list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 'sum' is the sum of all elements in the list `arr` , the 3rd element of the list which is 3 and the sum which is equal to 15 is being printed**

Example2:
Initial State: The points list is a list of points. The `shoelace_sum` is the sum of all terms calculated as \(x_1 * y_2 - y_1 * x_2\) for each consecutive pair of points in the `points` list, the `area` is the absolute value of `shoelace_sum` divided by 2.0, `i` is equal to `len(points) - 2`, and `x1` is the first element of `points[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `points[i]`, while `x2` is the first element of `points[i + 1]`, and `y2` is the second element of `points[i + 1]`.
```
print(area)
```
Example Answer:
The `print(area)` statement will print the calculated area of the polygon formed by the points in the `points` list.
Since the exact `points` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `area`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated area.
Output: ** The points list is a list of points. The `shoelace_sum` is the sum of all terms calculated as \(x_1 * y_2 - y_1 * x_2\) for each consecutive pair of points in the `points` list, the `area` is the absolute value of `shoelace_sum` divided by 2.0, `i` is equal to `len(points) - 2`, and `x1` is the first element of `points[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `points[i]`, while `x2` is the first element of `points[i + 1]`, and `y2` is the second element of `points[i + 1]`, and area is printed ,area (where area is the area of the polygon formed by the points in the `points` list)**

Example3:
Initial State: `balances` is a list of integers, `A` is the first element of the balances list, `B` is the second element of the balances list, and the amount is an integer  less than or equal to A.
```
print(f"The amount amount is less than or equal to A")
```
Example Answer:
The code prints a formatted string indicating whether the amount is less than or equal to A. Where A is the first element of the balances list and amount is an integer less than or equal to A.
Output: ** `balances` is a list of integers, `A` is the first element of the balances list, `B` is the second element of the balances list, and the amount is an integer  less than or equal to A., and this si printed: "The amount [amount] is less than or equal to [A]"**
Your Task:
Initial State: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `time` is t-1, `comand` is a list of strings read from the last line of stdin. If `comand` has exactly 3 elements, then `obj` is the first string of the last line of stdin, `com` is the second string of the last line of stdin, and `el` is the third string of the last line of stdin. If `el` is '.Q', then the value of `obj` is set to True. If `el` is '.S', then the first element of `points` is 0 and the second element is 10, and '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed where time is t-1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that caught the golden snitch. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `comand` does not have exactly 3 elements, then `obj` is either '.B' or a player, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the new position of `obj` after moving in the direction specified by `com`. If `obj` is '.B' and the cell at the new position `nxt` is occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player and the cell at the new position `nxt` is occupied by '.B', then the player is eliminated and "time is t-1 and player is eliminated" is printed. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', the value of `obj` in `allPlayers` is set to False and if the goal is scored, '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed where time is t-1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal of the team that scored, which is either 'B' or 'W', and the element at index team in points is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T', if `obj` is a player, then the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.
```
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

```
Now, please think step by step. Based on the precondition which describes the state of the program, variables , objects etc before the code is executed, calculate what will be the postcondition by adding in the precondition what is being printed. Include the values of the variables, objects etc. that are printed.
Use natural language to describe the output, easily understandable by a human and strictly adhere to the format Output: **the postcondition including what is being printed**.
