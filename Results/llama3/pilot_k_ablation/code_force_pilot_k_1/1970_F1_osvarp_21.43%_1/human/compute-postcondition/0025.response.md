Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, grid is a list of n lines each containing m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in grid with their respective positions, allPlayers is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in grid with the value False, goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in grid and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in grid, points is a list containing two values, the first value is 10 if obj starts with 'B' otherwise it is 0, the second value is 0, t is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing a command, time is 0, obj is the first element of the command from the first line of stdin, com is the second element of the command from the first line of stdin, and the current value of el is '.S'**

The code assigns a value to the variable `team` based on the first character of `obj`. If `obj` starts with 'B', `team` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. Then, it increments the value at the index `team` in the `points` list by 10. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
