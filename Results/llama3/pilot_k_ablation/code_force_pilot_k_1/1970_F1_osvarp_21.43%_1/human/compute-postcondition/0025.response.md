Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list of n lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, goal is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, points is a list with two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 10, stdin contains at least t-2 lines, i is n-1, t is an integer greater than 0, time is 0, obj is the first string of the second line of stdin, com is the second string of the second line of stdin, and el is '.S'.**

In this output state, the value of `points` has been modified. The first line of the code assigns a value to `team` based on the first character of `obj`. Since `obj` is the first string of the second line of stdin, its value is not specified, but it is used to determine the value of `team`. The second line increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since `team` is either 0 or 1, the first or second element of `points` is incremented by 10, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
