Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list of n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each element in the grid that is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each player in the grid, `goal` is a list of two lists containing the positions of 'B.G' and 'W.G' respectively, `points` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 0, `stdin` is not empty, `i` is n-1, `t` is an integer read from the first line of stdin.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n-1`. The value of `t` is now an integer read from the first line of stdin, which means that the first line of stdin has been consumed. The stdin is still not empty, but it now contains one less line.
