Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list of `n` lines each containing `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key '.B' with the value (0, 0) and the keys of all non '..' elements in `grid` with their respective positions, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the keys of all players in `grid` with the value False, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the positions of all 'BG' elements in `grid` and the second list contains the positions of all 'WG' elements in `grid`, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `t` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines each containing a command.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that represents the number of lines in `stdin` minus one, because `stdin.readline()` reads one line from `stdin`. The values of the other variables are not affected by the code. The `stdin` now contains `t-1` lines each containing a command because one line has been read.
