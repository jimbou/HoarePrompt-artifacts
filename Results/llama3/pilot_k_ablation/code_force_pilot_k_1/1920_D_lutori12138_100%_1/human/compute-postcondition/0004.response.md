The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If a is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, x is an integer and is not an element of the list b does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to a is not empty and i is now the first element in a.
State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is not an element of the list `b`, `a` is not empty, `i` is the first element in `a`**
