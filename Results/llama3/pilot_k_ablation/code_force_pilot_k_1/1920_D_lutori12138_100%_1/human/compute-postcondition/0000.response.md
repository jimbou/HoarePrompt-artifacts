The code `x = int(x)` converts the first element of the list `x` to an integer and assigns it back to `x`. The first element of the list `x` is the number of test cases, which is an integer. Therefore, the value of `x` is now an integer representing the number of test cases.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases.**
