Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array. The program iterates through the operations, updating the size of the array and storing the elements in the dictionary. Then, it iterates through the queries, using the function `resolve_query` to find the k-th element of the array.

The function `resolve_query` takes an integer `x` as input, which represents the k-th element of the array. It first checks if `x` is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the corresponding element from `b`. If not, it iterates through the list `a` in reverse order, modifying `x` based on the values in the list, until it finds a value that is present in `b`. If found, it returns the corresponding element from `b`. If not found, it continues modifying `x` until it falls within a certain range defined by the last element in the list `a`. The function returns the modified `x` if it is present in `b`, otherwise, it returns the modified `x` within the specified range.

The program correctly handles the case where the size of the array exceeds 10^18, by skipping the operations that would cause the size to exceed this limit. It also correctly handles the case where the query is out of range, by returning the modified `x` within the specified range.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
