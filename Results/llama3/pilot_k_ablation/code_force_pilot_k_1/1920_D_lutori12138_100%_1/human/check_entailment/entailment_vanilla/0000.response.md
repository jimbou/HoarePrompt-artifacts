Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The operations can either append an integer to the end of the array or append x copies of the array to the end of the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and the number of queries. It then reads the operations and stores them in the list `a`. The list `a` is used to keep track of the size of the array after each operation.

The program also uses a dictionary `b` to store the value of the elements in the array. The keys of the dictionary are the indices of the elements and the values are the values of the elements.

After reading all the operations, the program reverses the list `a` and then reads the queries. For each query, it calls the function `func_1` to determine the k-th element of the array.

The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and returns the value of the x-th element in the array. It first checks if `x` is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the value of `b[x]`. If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates over the list `a` in reverse order and for each `i` in `a`, it calculates the value of `x` modulo `i` and adds 1 to it. This is done to handle the case where the array is appended to itself. If `x` is in `b` after this calculation, it returns the value of `b[x]`.

The program then prints the results of the queries.

Correctness: **True**
