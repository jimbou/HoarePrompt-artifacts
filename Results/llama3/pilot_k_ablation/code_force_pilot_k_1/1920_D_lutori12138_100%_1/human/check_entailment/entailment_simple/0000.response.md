Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes an empty list `a` and a dictionary `b` to store the operations and their corresponding values.
2. It reads the number of test cases, operations, and queries from the input.
3. For each operation, it checks if the last element of `a` is greater than 10^19. If it is, it skips the operation to avoid overflow.
4. If the operation is of type 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the value in `b`.
5. If the operation is of type 2 (append copies of the array), it appends a new element to `a` with the value of the last element multiplied by the number of copies plus 1.
6. After all operations are processed, it reverses the list `a`.
7. For each query, it calls the `resolve_query` function with the query value as an argument.
8. The `resolve_query` function takes an integer `x` as input and returns the corresponding value from the collection `b` if `x` is present in `b`. If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through the list `a` in reverse order, updating `x` to be the remainder of `x-1` divided by the current element of `a`, plus 1. This effectively "wraps around" the array to find the corresponding value. If `x` is found in `b` during this iteration, it returns the corresponding value.

The program correctly handles the problem's requirements, including:

* Handling overflow by skipping operations that would result in values greater than 10^19.
* Correctly implementing the logic for appending integers and copies of the array.
* Efficiently resolving queries by using the `b` dictionary to store values and the "wrap-around" logic to find corresponding values in the array.

Correctness: **True**
