Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation and a dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and the number of queries. It then reads the operations and updates the list `a` and the dictionary `b` accordingly.

After reading all the operations, the program reverses the list `a` and defines a function `func_1` to resolve the queries. The function `func_1` takes a query as input and returns the k-th element of the array.

The program then reads the queries and applies the function `func_1` to each query. The results are printed as a list of integers.

The execution summary of the program shows that it correctly handles the test cases and produces the expected output.

However, there is a small issue in the program. The function `resolve_query` is not defined in the program, but it is used in the print statement. It seems that `resolve_query` should be replaced with `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
