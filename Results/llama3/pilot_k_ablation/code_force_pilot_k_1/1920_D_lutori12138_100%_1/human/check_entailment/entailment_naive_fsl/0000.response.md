Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query is larger than the size of the array after all operations. In this case, the program should return an error or handle it in some way, but it does not. 

For example, if the input is:

    1 10
    1 1
    1 2
    2 1
    1 3
    2 3
    1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20 1000000000000000000

The program will not work correctly because the last query is larger than the size of the array after all operations.

Also, the program does not correctly handle the case when the array size exceeds 10^18. In this case, the program should handle the overflow, but it does not. 

For example, if the input is:

    1 10
    2 1000000000
    1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will not work correctly because the array size exceeds 10^18.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
