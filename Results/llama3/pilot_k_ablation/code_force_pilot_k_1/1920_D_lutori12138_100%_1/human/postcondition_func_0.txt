This function takes an integer `x` and a list of integers `a` as input, and a collection `b` as a reference. It first checks if `x` is in `b` and returns the corresponding element if found. If not, it iterates through the list `a`, updating `x` to be the remainder of `x-1` divided by each element in `a`, plus 1. If `x` is found in `b` during this iteration, it returns the corresponding element. If `x` is not found in `b` after the iteration, the function returns nothing, leaving `x` in a state between 1 and the last element of `a` (inclusive), or unchanged if `a` is empty.
