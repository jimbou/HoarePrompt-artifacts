#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a list of integers: the first two integers are the number of operations and the number of queries, followed by a list of operations, where each operation is a list of two integers, and a list of queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns an element from collection `b` at the index equal to the number of test cases `x`.
    #State: *`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `x` is not in `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is an integer between 1 and the last element in `a` (inclusive), `x` is not in `b`, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the last element in `a`. If `a` is empty, `x` remains the same as the initial state.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer `x` and a list of integers `a` as input, and a collection `b` as a reference. It first checks if `x` is in `b` and returns the corresponding element if found. If not, it iterates through the list `a`, updating `x` to be the remainder of `x-1` divided by each element in `a`, plus 1. If `x` is found in `b` during this iteration, it returns the corresponding element. If `x` is not found in `b` after the iteration, the function returns nothing, leaving `x` in a state between 1 and the last element of `a` (inclusive), or unchanged if `a` is empty.
