Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either 'a' or 'b' is even and if the other dimension is not equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The program also correctly handles the case where both 'a' and 'b' are even, in which case it prints 'yes' because another rectangle can be formed by halving both dimensions.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
