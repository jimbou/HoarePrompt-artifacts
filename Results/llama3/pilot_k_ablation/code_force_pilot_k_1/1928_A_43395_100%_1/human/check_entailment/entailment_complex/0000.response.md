Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes' because Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal rectangles and then combine them to form a new rectangle.
2. If `a` is even and `a/2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b/2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'yes' because Bob can cut the rectangle into two unequal rectangles and then combine them to form a new rectangle.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no' because Bob cannot obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
