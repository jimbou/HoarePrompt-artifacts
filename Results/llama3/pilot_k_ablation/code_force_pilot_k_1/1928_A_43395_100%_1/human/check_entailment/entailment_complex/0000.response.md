Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether it is possible to obtain a different rectangle from a given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles.

The program works by checking the parity of the input integers `a` and `b`. If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes' because it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a different rectangle. If only one of `a` or `b` is even, it checks if the even number is not equal to twice the odd number. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes' because it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a different rectangle. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'no' because it is not possible to obtain a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
