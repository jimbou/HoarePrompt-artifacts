Reasoning:

The program is trying to determine if a given rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. If `a` is even and `a/2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b/2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

However, the program does not consider the case where `a` and `b` are both odd. In this case, the rectangle can still be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, but the program will incorrectly print 'no'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
