Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking if either `a` or `b` is even and if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. However, this approach is not correct.

The problem statement says that Bob can rotate and move the two resulting rectangles as he wishes. This means that the program should check if the two resulting rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions, not just if one dimension is equal to half of the other.

For example, in the case where `a = 2` and `b = 6`, the program will print 'yes' because `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2 != b`. However, this is not the correct reason why Bob can form a new rectangle. The correct reason is that the two resulting rectangles of size `2 x 3` can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `4 x 3`, which is different from the original rectangle.

The correct approach would be to check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, then Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and combine them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
