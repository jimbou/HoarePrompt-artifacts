Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving them.

The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the rectangle (a and b) and checks the following conditions:
   - If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles with integer sides, which can then be combined to form a different rectangle.
   - If a is even and a/2 is not equal to b, or if b is even and b/2 is not equal to a, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, which can then be combined to form a different rectangle.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides that can be combined to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
