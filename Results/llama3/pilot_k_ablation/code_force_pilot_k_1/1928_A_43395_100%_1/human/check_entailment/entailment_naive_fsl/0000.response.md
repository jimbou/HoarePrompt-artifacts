Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program prints 'no', but according to the problem description, Bob can cut the 3x3 rectangle into two 3x1 rectangles and then form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sides of the rectangle are even or odd, but it does not consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle. The program should check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sides is greater than 1, because if the GCD is greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a different rectangle.
