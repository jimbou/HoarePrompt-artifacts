Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program prints 'no', but according to the problem description, it should print 'yes' because the 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then these two rectangles can be used to form the 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sides of the rectangle are even or if one side is half of the other. However, it does not consider the case where the sides are odd and can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
