Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers a and b. It then determines whether a and b can be equal after a series of operations (halving a or b if they are even) and prints 'yes' if possible, 'no' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input, leaving the number of test cases and the last two integers in the input as residual values.**
