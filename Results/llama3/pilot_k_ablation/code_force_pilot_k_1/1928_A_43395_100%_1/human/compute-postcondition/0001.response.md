Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers from the first line of the input, which are guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with two integers, as the first line has been consumed by the input operation.
