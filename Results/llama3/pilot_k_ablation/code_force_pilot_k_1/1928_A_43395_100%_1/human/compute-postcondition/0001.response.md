Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are assigned the two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains one less test case, as one test case has been processed.
