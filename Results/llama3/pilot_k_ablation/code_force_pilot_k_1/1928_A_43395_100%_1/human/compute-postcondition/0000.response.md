The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `i` is 0,  `input()` must be greater than 0**
