Output: **`a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd or both `a` and `b` are odd. Additionally, if `a` is even, then `a / 2` is equal to `b`, and if `b` is even, then `b / 2` is equal to `a`, and 'no' is being printed**
