Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd. If either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even then `a / 2` equals `b`, and if `b` is even then `b / 2` equals `a`, and 'no' is printed.***
