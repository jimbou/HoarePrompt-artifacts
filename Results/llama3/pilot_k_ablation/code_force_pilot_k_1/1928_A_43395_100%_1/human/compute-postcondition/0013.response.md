Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` is odd, or both are odd, then if `a` is even and `a / 2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even and `a / 2` is equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b / 2` is equal to `a`, then 'no' is printed.***
