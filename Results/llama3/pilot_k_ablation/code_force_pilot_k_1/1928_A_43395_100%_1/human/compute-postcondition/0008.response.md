Output: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd. The current value of `a` and `b` is such that either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, and 'yes' is printed**
