The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 1, the list `p` now includes all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, and also the integer 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive and also includes the integer 1, stdin is empty.**
