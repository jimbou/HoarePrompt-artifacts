The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and the input to `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input to `int(input())`. If the input to `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least one line of input that is a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and i is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least one line of input that is a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 0**
