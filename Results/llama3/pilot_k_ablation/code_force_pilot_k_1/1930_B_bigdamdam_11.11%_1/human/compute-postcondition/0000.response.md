To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as the input from `stdin` provides at least one integer value for `t` (the number of test cases) and `i` is within the range of `t`.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) â€” the number of test cases, `i` is 0**
