Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to t (2 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `p` is a list containing the integer 2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains the same, equal to `t`, which is an integer between 2 and 10^3. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, which is 2. The list `p` now contains the integer 2, which was appended to it by the code. The stdin remains empty, as no input was taken.
