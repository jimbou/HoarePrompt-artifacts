To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2), and `i` should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 2.

State: **`a` is an integer equal to t (2 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list, stdin is empty**
