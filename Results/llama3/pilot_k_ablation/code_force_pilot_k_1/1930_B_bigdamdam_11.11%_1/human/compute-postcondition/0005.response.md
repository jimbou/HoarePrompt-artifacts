To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, stdin is empty**
