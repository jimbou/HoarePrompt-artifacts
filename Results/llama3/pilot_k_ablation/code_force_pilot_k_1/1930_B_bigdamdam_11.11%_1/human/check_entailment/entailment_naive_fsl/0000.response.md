Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it generates a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. 

The program works by first creating a list of even numbers from 2 to n, and then appending the odd numbers from 1 to n. This ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation are divisible by each other, as even numbers are not divisible by odd numbers and vice versa. 

For example, for n = 4, the program outputs [2, 4, 1, 3], which is a valid permutation because there are no two distinct indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. 

Similarly, for n = 3, the program outputs [2, 1, 3], which is also a valid permutation. 

In general, the program works for all n ≥ 3 because it ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation are divisible by each other, which is the required condition. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
