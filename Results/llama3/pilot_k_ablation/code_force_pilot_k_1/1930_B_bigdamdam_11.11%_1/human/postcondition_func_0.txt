The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer representing the length of a permutation. It then generates a permutation of all integers from 1 to the given length, with even numbers appearing before odd numbers, and prints this permutation for each test case. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
