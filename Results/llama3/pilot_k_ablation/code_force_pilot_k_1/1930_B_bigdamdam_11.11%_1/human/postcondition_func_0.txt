The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer representing the length of a permutation. It then generates a permutation of integers from 1 to the given length, with even numbers appearing before odd numbers, and prints the permutation. The function repeats this process for all test cases, ultimately consuming all input and producing the corresponding permutations as output.
