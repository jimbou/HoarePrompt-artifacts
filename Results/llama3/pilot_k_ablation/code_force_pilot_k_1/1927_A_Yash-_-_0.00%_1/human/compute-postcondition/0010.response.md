Postcondition: ***t is an integer, x is a list of characters, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10), n must be greater than 0. If 'B' is in the list x, the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.***
