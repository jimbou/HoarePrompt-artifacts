Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character, stdin contains t-2 pairs of inputs: each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character. If 'B' is in x, the difference between end and start is printed. If 'B' is not in x, 0 is printed.***
