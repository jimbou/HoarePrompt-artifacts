According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10) and stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
