The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains a sequence of inputs: t-1 pairs of inputs, each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. So for the loop to be executed  the n is at least 1 and i is now 0.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains a sequence of inputs: t-1 pairs of inputs, each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
