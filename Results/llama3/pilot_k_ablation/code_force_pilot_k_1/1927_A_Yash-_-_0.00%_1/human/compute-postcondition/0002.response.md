The code reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `t`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1. Then, it reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `x`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1. Since there are t-1 pairs of inputs remaining in stdin, the number of inputs remaining after the code execution is t-2 pairs of inputs.

Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character, stdin contains t-2 pairs of inputs: each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character.**
