Output State: **t is an integer, x is a list of characters, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10), n must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer and stdin contains t-1 test cases, after this line, stdin contains t-2 test cases. The second line assigns a list of characters from the input to `x`. Since `x` is a list of characters, it now contains the string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is still an integer (1 <= n <= 10) and must be greater than 0.
