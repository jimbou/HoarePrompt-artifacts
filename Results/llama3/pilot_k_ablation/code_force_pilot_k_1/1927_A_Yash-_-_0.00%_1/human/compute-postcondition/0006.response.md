The code prints the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x, which is end - start.
Output: **t is an integer, x is a list of characters containing at least one 'B' character, i is 0, start is the index of the first 'B' in x, end is the index of the last 'B' in x, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10), n must be greater than 0, and the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x which is end - start is being printed**
