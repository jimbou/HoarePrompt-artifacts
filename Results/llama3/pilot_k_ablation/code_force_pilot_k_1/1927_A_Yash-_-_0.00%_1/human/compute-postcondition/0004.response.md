Output State: **t is an integer, x is a list of characters containing at least one 'B' character, i is 0, start is the index of the first 'B' in x, end is the index of the last 'B' in x, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10), n must be greater than 0**

The code assigns the index of the first 'B' in list x to the variable start and the index of the last 'B' in list x to the variable end. The index of the first 'B' is found using the index method, and the index of the last 'B' is found by reversing the list and using the index method, then subtracting the result from the length of the list minus 1. The values of t, x, i, and stdin remain unchanged.
