The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a variable. The first line assigns the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `x` to the variable `start`. The second line assigns the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `x` to the variable `end`.

The initial state provides the following information:

* `n` is at least 1
* `i` is 0
* `t` is an integer
* `x` is a string of length `n` containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character
* stdin contains `t-2` pairs of inputs: each pair consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character

After executing the code, the following changes occur:

* `start` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `x`. Since `x` contains at least one 'B' character, `start` will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.
* `end` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `x`. Since `x` contains at least one 'B' character, `end` will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin remains unchanged as well, as the code does not interact with it.

Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character, start is a non-negative integer less than n, end is a non-negative integer less than n, stdin contains t-2 pairs of inputs: each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character**
