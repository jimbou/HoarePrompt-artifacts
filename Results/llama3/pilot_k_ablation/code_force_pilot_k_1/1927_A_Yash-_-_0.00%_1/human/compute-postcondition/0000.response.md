The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. Since the code only reads one integer, the remaining input will still be in the stdin.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
