The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. In the initial state, stdin contains a sequence of inputs, starting with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). This integer `t` is assigned to the variable `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains a sequence of inputs: t-1 pairs of inputs, each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
