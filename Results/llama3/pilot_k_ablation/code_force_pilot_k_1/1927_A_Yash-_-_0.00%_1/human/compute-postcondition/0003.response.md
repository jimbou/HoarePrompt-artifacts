Postcondition: **n is at least 1, i is 0, t is an integer, x is a string of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character, stdin contains t-2 pairs of inputs: each pair consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B' character. The current value of x contains at least one 'B' character.**
