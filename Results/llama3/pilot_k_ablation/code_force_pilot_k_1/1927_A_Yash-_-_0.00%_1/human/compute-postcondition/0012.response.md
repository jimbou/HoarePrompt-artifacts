Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t, followed by t pairs of inputs. Each pair consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters. The function then calculates and prints the length of the substring containing only 'B' characters for each pair, or 0 if no 'B' characters are found. The function processes all input pairs and leaves stdin empty.**
