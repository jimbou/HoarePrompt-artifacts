Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates and prints the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' characters in each string, or 0 if no 'B' characters are present. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty upon completion.**
