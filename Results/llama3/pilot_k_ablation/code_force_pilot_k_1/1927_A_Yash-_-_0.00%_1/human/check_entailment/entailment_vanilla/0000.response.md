Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `n`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the strip `t` and the strip itself `x`.

3. The program checks if there is at least one black cell 'B' in the strip. If there is, it finds the index of the first black cell `start` and the index of the last black cell `end` by reversing the strip and finding the index of the first black cell from the end.

4. The program then calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white by subtracting the start index from the end index.

5. If there are no black cells in the strip, the program prints 0.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the strip has only one cell, and it correctly handles the case where the strip has multiple cells with both white and black cells.

7. The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
