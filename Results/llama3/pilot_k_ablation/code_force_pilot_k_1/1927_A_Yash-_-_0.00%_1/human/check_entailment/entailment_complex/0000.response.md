Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters.

The program correctly calculates the minimum length of the segment by finding the indices of the first and last 'B' characters in the string and printing their difference. If no 'B' characters are present, it prints 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge case where there are no 'B' characters in the string.

Correctness: **True**
