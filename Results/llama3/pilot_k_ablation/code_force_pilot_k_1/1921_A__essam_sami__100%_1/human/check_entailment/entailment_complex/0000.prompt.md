Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin is empty, steps is equal to t, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between (a, b) and (c, d) for the last testcase, x is the square of the distance between (a, b) and (e, f) for the last testcase.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes t test cases, and prints the minimum square distance between two points in each testcase. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, but it modifies the state of stdin by consuming all input. The function's purpose is to calculate and print the minimum square distance between two points in each testcase.
