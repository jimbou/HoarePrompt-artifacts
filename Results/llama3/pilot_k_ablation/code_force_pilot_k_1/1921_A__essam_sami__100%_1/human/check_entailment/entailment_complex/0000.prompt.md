Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 0 test cases, steps is t, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (c, d) of the last test case, x is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f) of the last test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the square of the distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
