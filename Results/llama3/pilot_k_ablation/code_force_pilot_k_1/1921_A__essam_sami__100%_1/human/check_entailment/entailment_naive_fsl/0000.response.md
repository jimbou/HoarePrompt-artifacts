Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates do not form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39

The program will output:

9
4
784

However, the correct output should be:

9
4
784

But if we change the input to:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2

The program will output:

9
4
784
0

But the correct output should be:

9
4
784
1

This is because the program is calculating the distance between the first two points and the first and third points, and then printing the smaller of the two. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the points may not form a square.

A correct approach would be to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square using the formula (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y).
