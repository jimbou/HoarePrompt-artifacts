This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the square of the distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
