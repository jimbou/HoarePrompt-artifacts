Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, steps is 0, stdin contains at least t-4 test cases, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (c, d), x is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f). The program prints the smaller value between the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (c, d) and the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f).***
