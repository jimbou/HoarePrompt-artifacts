The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` testcases, each consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` testcases, each consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).**
