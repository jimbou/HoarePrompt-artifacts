The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 100.

The value of `t` is now assigned to the variable `t`, and the standard input now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers.**
