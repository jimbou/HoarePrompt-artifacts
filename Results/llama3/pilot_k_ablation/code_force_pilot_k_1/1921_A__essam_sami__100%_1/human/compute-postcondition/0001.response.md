According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we can still adjust the state of `steps` to reflect the initial value it will take when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` testcases, each consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `steps` is 0**
