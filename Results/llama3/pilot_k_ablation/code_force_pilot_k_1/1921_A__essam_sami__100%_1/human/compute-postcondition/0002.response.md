Output State: **t is at least 1, steps is 0, stdin contains at least t-4 test cases, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (c, d), x is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f)**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `steps` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin contains at least `t-4` test cases because four test cases have been consumed by the four `input()` calls. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are assigned integer values from the input. The variable `n` is calculated as the square of the distance between points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, and the variable `x` is calculated as the square of the distance between points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.
