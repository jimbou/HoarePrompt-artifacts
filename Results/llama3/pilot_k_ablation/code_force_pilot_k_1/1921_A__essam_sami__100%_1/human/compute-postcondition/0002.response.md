Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 testcases, each consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between (a, b) and (c, d), x is the square of the distance between (a, b) and (e, f).**

The code reads four lines from stdin, each containing two integers, and assigns them to the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h. It then calculates the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (c, d) and assigns it to n, and the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f) and assigns it to x. The value of t is not modified, and the value of steps remains 0. The remaining testcases in stdin are not affected.
