Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.**
