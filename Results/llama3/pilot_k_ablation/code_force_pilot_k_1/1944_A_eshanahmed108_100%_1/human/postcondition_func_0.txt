This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then prints the result of each test case, which is either n if n-k is greater than 1, or 1 otherwise. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been read, leaving the standard input empty and producing a list of results as output.
