Reads a series of integer pairs from standard input, where each pair represents the number of nodes (n) and the number of edges (k) in a graph, and prints the number of nodes if the difference between the number of nodes and edges is greater than 1, otherwise prints 1, repeating this process for a number of times specified by the first integer read from standard input.
