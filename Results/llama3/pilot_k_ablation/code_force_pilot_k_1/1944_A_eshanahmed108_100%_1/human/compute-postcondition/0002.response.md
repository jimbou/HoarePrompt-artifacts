The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is greater than 1; otherwise, it prints 1. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `k` is an integer, the output will be either the value of `n` or 1, depending on the value of `k`.

Output: **n if n - k > 1; otherwise, 1 (where n is an integer greater than 0 and k is an integer)**
