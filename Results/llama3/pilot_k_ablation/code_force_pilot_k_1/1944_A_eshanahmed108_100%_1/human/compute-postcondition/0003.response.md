The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is greater than 1, otherwise it prints 1. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`.

Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), `int(input())` is greater than 0, _ is 0, and this is printed: n if n - k > 1 else 1**
