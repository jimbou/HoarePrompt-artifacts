According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), `int(input())` is greater than 0, _ is 0**
