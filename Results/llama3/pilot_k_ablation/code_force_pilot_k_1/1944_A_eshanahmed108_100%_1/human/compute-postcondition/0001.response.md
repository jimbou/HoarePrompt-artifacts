Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), `int(input())` is greater than 0, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and the value of `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k. The values of `int(input())` and `_` remain unchanged.
