Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, and the value of `k` is an integer. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, as one input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
