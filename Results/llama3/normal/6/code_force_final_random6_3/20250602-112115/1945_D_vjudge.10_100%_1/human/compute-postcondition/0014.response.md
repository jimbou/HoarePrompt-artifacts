Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its initial value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` less than `m`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, and `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all indices `i` that are less than `m`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `n` and `m` retain their initial values. The variable `x` accumulates the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` for all indices from `n-1` down to `0`.
