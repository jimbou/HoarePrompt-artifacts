Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is 0, and `i` is n - 1. The current value of `i` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the sum of `x` (which is 0) and the element at index `i` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `a` and `b` still being lists of non-negative integers, `n` being a positive integer, `m` being a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` being 0, and `i` being `n - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is still less than `m`.
