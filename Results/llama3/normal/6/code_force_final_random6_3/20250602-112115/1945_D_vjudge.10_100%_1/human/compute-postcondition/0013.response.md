Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + a[n-2]`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + min(a[n-2], b[n-2]) + min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`, and `i` is `n - 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to include the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, where `i` is `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pergunta` is still dependent on the condition `i < m`, but its previous value and the new value of `x` are not affected by this condition.
