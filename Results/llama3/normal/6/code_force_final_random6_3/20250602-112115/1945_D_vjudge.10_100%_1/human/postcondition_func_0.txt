This function takes as input an integer `pergunta` and two lists of non-negative integers `a` and `b` of the same length `n`, and an integer `m` such that 0 <= m <= n. It calculates the minimum value between the initial value of `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from index `n-1` to `0`, plus the sum of the first `m` elements in `a`. The function then prints this calculated minimum value.
