Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + min(a[n-2], b[n-2]) + a[n-3]`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, and `i` is `n - 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the expression `x + a[i]`, where `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])` and `i` is `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
