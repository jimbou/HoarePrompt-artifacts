Output: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its initial value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` less than `m`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, and `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`, and the value of `pergunta` is being printed**
