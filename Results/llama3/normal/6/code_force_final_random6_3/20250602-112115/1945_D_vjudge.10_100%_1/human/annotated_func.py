#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of non-negative integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m <= n and n is the length of lists a and b.
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum of its initial value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` less than `m`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, and `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: the minimum of the initial value of pergunta and the sum of x and the sum of the first m elements in list a

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input an integer `pergunta` and two lists of non-negative integers `a` and `b` of the same length `n`, and an integer `m` such that 0 <= m <= n. It calculates the minimum value between the initial value of `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from index `n-1` to `0`, plus the sum of the first `m` elements in `a`. The function then prints this calculated minimum value.
