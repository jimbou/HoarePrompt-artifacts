Postcondition: ***`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + a[n-2]` if `i` is less than `m`. Otherwise, the value of `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, and `i` is `n - 2`.***
