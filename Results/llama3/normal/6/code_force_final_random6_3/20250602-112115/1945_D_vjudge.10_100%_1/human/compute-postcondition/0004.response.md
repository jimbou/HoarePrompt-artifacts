Postcondition: ***`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is 0, and `i` is n - 1. If `i` is less than `m`, the current value of `i` is used to update `pergunta`.***
