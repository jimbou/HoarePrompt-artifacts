To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
