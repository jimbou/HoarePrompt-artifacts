Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m <= n and n is the length of lists `a` and `b`, and `x` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `x`, which is assigned the value 0.
