Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, and `i` is n - 1. If `i` is less than `m`, the current value of `i` is used to update `pergunta`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`, which are non-negative integers. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pergunta` is still the minimum of its previous value and `x + a[i]`, but now `x` has a specific value. The condition `i` is less than `m` is still applicable for updating `pergunta`.
