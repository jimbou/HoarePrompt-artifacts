Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

The program initializes `pergunta` to infinity and then iterates over the lists `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning. For each position `i`, it calculates the minimum cost to reach that position by taking the minimum of the cost to reach the previous position (`x`) and the cost to bribe the person at position `i` (`a[i]`). If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`.

Finally, the program prints the minimum value of `pergunta`, which represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
