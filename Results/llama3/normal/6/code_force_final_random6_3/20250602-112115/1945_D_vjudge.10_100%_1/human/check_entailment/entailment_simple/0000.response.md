Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost.

The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, but based on the comments, it seems that it is supposed to calculate the minimum cost. However, the calculation is already done in the main part of the code, and the function call is not necessary.

The program correctly initializes the variable `pergunta` to infinity and then iterates over the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order. For each position `i` less than `m`, it updates the minimum cost `pergunta` by taking the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.

The program then prints the minimum cost `pergunta`, which is the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
