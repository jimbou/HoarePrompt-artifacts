To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, because the range starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`. If `n` is 0, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is greater than 0. The other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `x`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, and `x` is 0, `i` is n - 1**
