To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than `-1` (since the loop iterates from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-3`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + a[n-2]` if `i` is less than `m`. Otherwise, the value of `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m < n, `x` is equal to `min(a[n-1], b[n-1]) + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, and `i` is `n - 3`.**
