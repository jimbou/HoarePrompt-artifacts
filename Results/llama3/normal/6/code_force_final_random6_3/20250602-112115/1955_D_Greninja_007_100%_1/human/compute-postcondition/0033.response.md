Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, `r`, `sm`, `ans` are as described in the precondition. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If the frequency of `a[r - 1]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r - 1]` in `cb`, then `sm` is increased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If the frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `cb`, then `sm` is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. The frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, then `sm` is increased by 1. The frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is increased by 1. If the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `cb`, then `sm` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged. The frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1.**
