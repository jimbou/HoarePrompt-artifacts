Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m + 1 < r <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:r] and ca[a[m]] is increased by 1, `r` is m + 2, `ca[a[m - m]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r - 1]]` is increased by 1. If the frequency of a[r - 1] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r - 1] in cb, then `sm` is increased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If the frequency of a[r - m - 1] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m - 1] in cb, then `sm` is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. The frequency of a[r - m - 1] in ca is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, then `sm` is increased by 1. The frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `sm` and `ans` are still the same as before, but the frequency of a[r] in ca has been updated.
