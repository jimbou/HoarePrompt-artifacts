Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m] and ca[a[r]] is increased by 1, `r` is m, and ca[a[r - m]] is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
