Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m] and ca[a[r]] is increased by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `r` is m, if the current value of ca[a[r]] is less than the current value of cb[a[r]], then sm is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ca[a[r]]` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the frequency of the integer `a[r]` in the sorted list `a[:m]` has increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
