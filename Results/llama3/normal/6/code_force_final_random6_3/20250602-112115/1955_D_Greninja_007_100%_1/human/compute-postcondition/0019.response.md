Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m + 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m + 1] and ca[a[m]] is increased by 1, `r` is m + 1, `ca[a[m - m]]` is decreased by 1, and `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1. If the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, then `sm` is increased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ca[a[r]]` has been incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `sm` and `ans` are still dependent on the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` and `cb`, and the value of `k`.
