Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m], `ans` is either 0 or 1, `r` is m, `sm` is increased by 1, and the current value of ca[a[r]] is less than the current value of cb[a[r]].**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, including the ranges of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, and `ans`. The value of `r` remains `m`, and the relationship between `ca[a[r]]` and `cb[a[r]]` is still maintained.
