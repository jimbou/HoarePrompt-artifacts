Functionality: **This function calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in list `a` has at least `k` common elements with list `b`, where `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function takes as input four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers, and returns the count of such occurrences.**
