Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m + 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m + 1] and ca[a[m]] is increased by 1, `r` is m + 1, and ca[a[m - m]] is decreased by 1. `sm` is increased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `sm` is incremented by 1. If the new value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
