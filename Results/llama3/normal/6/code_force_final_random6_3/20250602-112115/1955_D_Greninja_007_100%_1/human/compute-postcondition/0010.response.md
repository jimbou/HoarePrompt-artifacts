Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m] and ca[a[r]] is increased by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `r` is m, if the current value of ca[a[r]] is less than the current value of cb[a[r]], then sm is decreased by 1. The current value of ca[a[r - m]] is less than or equal to the current value of cb[a[r - m]].**

The code decreases the value of `sm` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, but the value of `sm` has been updated.
