The only variable in the loop head is variable  r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m`, `n` is greater than `m`. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is `m + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m + 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m + 1] and ca[a[m]] is increased by 1, `r` is m + 1, and ca[a[m - m]] is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
