Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m], if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a[:m] and sorted list b is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 1, otherwise ans remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m] and ca[a[r]] is increased by 1, `r` is m, and ca[a[r - m]] is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m + 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m < n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m + 1] and ca[a[m]] is increased by 1, `r` is m + 1, `ca[a[m - m]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1. If the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, then `sm` is increased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, then `sm` is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. The frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, `r`, `sm`, `ans` are as described in the precondition. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If the frequency of `a[r - 1]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r - 1]` in `cb`, then `sm` is increased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If the frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `cb`, then `sm` is decreased by 1. If the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. The frequency of `a[r - m - 1]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, then `sm` is increased by 1. The frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is increased by 1. If the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `cb`, then `sm` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged. The frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
