Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m], if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a[:m] and sorted list b is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 1, otherwise ans remains 0.***
