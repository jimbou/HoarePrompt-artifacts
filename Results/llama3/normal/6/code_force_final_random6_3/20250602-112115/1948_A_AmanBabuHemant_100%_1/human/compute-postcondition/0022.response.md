Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 49, `n` is an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, `s` is a string of 'AAB' repeated n // 2 times, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string that consists of 'AAB' repeated n // 2 times. The value of `n` is still an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, and the value of `t` is still an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 49. The stdin still contains no input.
