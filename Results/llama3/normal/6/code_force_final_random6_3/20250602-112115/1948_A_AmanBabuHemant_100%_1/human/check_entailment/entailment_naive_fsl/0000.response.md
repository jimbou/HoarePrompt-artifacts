Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases according to the problem description. 

For each test case, it checks if the input number `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n//2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. 

The program also checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, and it produces the correct output for the example inputs provided. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
