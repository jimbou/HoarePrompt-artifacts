Based on the precondition, the string `s` is formed by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer.

The length of `s` is less than 200, which means the total number of characters in `s` is less than 200. Since each repetition of 'AAB' adds 3 characters, the total length of `s` will be a multiple of 3.

When the print statement `print(s)` is executed, it will print the string `s`, which consists of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times (where n is an even integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50)**
