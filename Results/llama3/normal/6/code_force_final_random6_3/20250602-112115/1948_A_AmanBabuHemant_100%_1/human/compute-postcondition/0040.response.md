Based on the initial state, the code snippet, and the task, I will determine what will be printed when the statement executes.

The initial state describes the values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` before the code is executed. However, the code snippet only contains a `print` statement with a string literal `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any variables or objects, the output will be the string literal `'NO'` itself, without any substitution or evaluation of variables.

Output: **NO**
