Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, `n` is an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and the standard input (stdin) will be empty. The loop will have printed 'NO' for odd values of `n`, and for even values of `n`, it will have printed 'YES' and the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200, or 'NO' otherwise.
