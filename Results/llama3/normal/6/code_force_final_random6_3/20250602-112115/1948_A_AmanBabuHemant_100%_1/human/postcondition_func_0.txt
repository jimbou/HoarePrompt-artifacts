This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n. For each test case, if n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it creates a string s by repeating 'AAB' n/2 times and checks if the length of s is less than 200. If the length of s is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string s. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
