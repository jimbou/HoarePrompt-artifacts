Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the input integer n is odd. If n is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to create a string with an odd number of special characters.
3. If n is even, it creates a string s by repeating 'AAB' n/2 times. This is a valid approach because each 'AAB' sequence contributes 2 special characters (at positions 1 and 3), and repeating it n/2 times will result in a total of n special characters.
4. The program checks if the length of the generated string s is less than 200. This is a valid check because the problem statement guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be represented as a string of length at most 200.
5. If the length of s is less than 200, the program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the string s.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
