The code prints the string `s` which is a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Since `n` is an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, the number of repetitions of 'AAB' will be between 0 and 25 (inclusive). The exact number of repetitions depends on the value of `n`.

Output: **'AAB' repeated [n // 2] times (where n is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive)**
