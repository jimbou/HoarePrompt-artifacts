The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 50. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1. So, `t` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 49.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 49, `n` is an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, stdin contains no input.**
