To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution directly). The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 50, stdin contains one input: a series of integers (greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50)**
