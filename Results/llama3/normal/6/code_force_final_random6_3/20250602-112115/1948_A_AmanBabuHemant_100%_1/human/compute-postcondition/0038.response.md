Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

The variable `s` is a string that consists of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n // 2` will be an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive).

Therefore, the string `s` will consist of 'AAB' repeated between 0 and 25 times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated between 0 and 25 times**
