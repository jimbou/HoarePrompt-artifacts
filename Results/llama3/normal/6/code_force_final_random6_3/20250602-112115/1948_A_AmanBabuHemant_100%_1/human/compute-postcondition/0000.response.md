Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 50, stdin contains one input: a series of integers (greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 50. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a series of integers (greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50). The values of other variables are not affected.
