Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 50, `n` is an even integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is still an even integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The new variable `s` is assigned a string value that consists of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will always be an integer, ensuring that the repetition is a whole number of times.
