Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 48, `n` is an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, stdin contains no input.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, which is the same range as before. The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 48. Since stdin contains no input, the input() function will not change the state of the program.
