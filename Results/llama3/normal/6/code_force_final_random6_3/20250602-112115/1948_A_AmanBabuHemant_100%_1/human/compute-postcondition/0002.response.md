Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 50, `n` is an integer greater or equal than 1 and less or equal than 50, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), as it was assigned the value of the input integer. The stdin is now empty, as the input integer has been consumed.
