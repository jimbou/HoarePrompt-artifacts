Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, and `func_2` to calculate the distribution of coins.

In `func_2`, the program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers in the `vals` list. Then, it calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and stores these products in the `vprod` list. The program then subtracts the sum of the `vprod` list from the LCM, and checks if the result is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` list.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers, and then uses this LCM to calculate the distribution of coins. The program also correctly checks if the final result is less than or equal to 0, and prints -1 if it is.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the last line of `func_2`, the program prints an empty string instead of the `vprod` list. This is because the `join` function is used with an empty string as the separator, which results in an empty string being printed.

Despite this small issue, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
