The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  vals, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the vals.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, N is an integer, stdin is empty and den is an integer equal to the first element of vals. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the list.
State: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, den is an integer equal to the first element of vals, stdin is empty, x is the first element in the list**
