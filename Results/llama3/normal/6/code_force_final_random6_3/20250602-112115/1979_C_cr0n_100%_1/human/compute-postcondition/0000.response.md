Output State: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers, den is an integer equal to the first element of vals, stdin is empty**

The first line of code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. Since stdin initially contains at least one space-separated list of integers, after this line executes, stdin will contain the remaining list of integers. The second line reads the remaining list of integers from stdin, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to vals. After this line executes, stdin is empty. The third line assigns the first element of vals to den. Since vals contains at least one element, den will be assigned a valid integer value.
