Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers `a` and `b`, which is the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). 

`func_2` is the main function that reads the input, calculates the LCM of all the multipliers in the list, and then uses this LCM to compute a new list of values (`vprod`) by dividing the LCM by each multiplier in the original list. If the final result (`den`) is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns None. Otherwise, it prints the new list of values (`vprod`) and returns None.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers and then uses this LCM to distribute the coins among the outcomes. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is not strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, it prints -1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
