Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is minimized. The LCM is calculated using the `func_1` function, which takes two numbers as input and returns their LCM.

The `func_2` function reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers, and then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. The amount of coins to bet on each outcome is calculated as the LCM divided by the multiplier for that outcome.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If it is not, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program prints the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including cases where the multipliers are large or where the number of outcomes is large. The program also correctly handles cases where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, in which case it prints -1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
