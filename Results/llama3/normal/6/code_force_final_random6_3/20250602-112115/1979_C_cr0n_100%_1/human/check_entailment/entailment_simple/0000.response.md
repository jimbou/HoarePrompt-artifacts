Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game, such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to find the minimum amount of coins that need to be distributed.

The program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (k_i) using the `func_1` function. This LCM represents the total amount of coins that will be received back for each possible winning outcome.

Then, the program calculates the amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. This is done using the list comprehension `vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]`.

After that, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the LCM. If it is not, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the LCM, the program prints the amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
