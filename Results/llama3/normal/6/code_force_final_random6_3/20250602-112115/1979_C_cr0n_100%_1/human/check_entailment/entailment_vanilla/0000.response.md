Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome (vals).

3. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers using the `func_1` function, which is a helper function that calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`.

4. It then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and stores these products in the `vprod` list.

5. The program then calculates the difference between the LCM and the sum of the products in `vprod`. This difference represents the amount of coins that can be distributed among the outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

6. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

7. Otherwise, the program prints the products in `vprod`, which represent the amount of coins to be bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
