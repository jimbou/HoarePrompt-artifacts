Output State: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, den is the result of func_1 applied to the first element of vals and the first element in the list, stdin is empty, x is the first element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated to be the result of the function `func_1` applied to the original value of `den` (which was the first element of `vals`) and the value of `x` (which is the first element in the list). The other variables, `N`, `vals`, `stdin`, and `x`, remain unchanged.
