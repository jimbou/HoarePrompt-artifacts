Output State: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, den is the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to the second element of vals and the second element in the list, and the second element in the list, stdin is empty, x is the second element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `den` has been updated by applying the function `func_1` to its previous value (which was the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element in the list) and the value of `x` (which is the second element in the list). The values of `N`, `vals`, `stdin`, and `x` remain unchanged.
