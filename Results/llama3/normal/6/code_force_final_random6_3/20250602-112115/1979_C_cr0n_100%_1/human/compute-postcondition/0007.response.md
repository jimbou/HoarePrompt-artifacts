Output State: **N is an integer, vals is an empty list, den is the result of func_1 applied to the last element of vals and the last element in the list, stdin is empty, x is the last element in the list**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same integer value for N, an empty list for vals (since all elements have been processed), the final result of the func_1 function applied to the last element of vals and the last element in the list for den, an empty stdin, and the last element of the list for x.
