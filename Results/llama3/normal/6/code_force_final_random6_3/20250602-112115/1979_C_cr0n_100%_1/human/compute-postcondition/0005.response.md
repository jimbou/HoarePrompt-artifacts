To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in vals:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `vals` list. The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `vals`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vals` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third time.

At the end of the last iteration, `vals` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, and `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element in the list, and the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `vals` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` must be the third element in the list.

The other variables, `N`, `stdin`, and `den`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is an integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element in the list, and the second element in the list, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the third element in the list**
