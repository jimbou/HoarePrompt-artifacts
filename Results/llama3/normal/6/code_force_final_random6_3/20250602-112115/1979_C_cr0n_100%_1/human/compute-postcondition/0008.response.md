Output State: **N is an integer, vals is an empty list, den is the result of func_1 applied to the last element of vals and the last element in the list minus the sum of the list comprehension of (den // r) for r in vals, stdin is empty, x is the last element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated by subtracting the sum of the list comprehension `[(den // r) for r in vals]` from its original value. Since `vals` is an empty list, the list comprehension will also be empty, and the sum will be 0. Therefore, the value of `den` will remain unchanged. The other variables, `N`, `vals`, `stdin`, and `x`, remain unaffected by the code snippet.
