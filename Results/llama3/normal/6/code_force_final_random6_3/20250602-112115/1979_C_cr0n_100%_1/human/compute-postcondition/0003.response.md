According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the vals.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, vals has at least 1 element, den is the result of func_1 applied to the first element of vals and the first element in the list, stdin is empty, x is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element in the list.
State: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, den is the result of func_1 applied to the second element of vals and the second element in the list, stdin is empty, x is the second element in the list**
