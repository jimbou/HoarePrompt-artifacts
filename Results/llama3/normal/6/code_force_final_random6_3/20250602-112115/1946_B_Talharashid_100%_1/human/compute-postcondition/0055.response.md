Postcondition: ***i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ele is the third element in the list l. If ele is negative and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the updated c and its previous value.***
