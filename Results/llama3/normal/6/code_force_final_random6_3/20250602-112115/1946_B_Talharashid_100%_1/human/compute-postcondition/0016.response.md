Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray in `l`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `i`, `n`, and `k` as in the initial state. The list `l` will be empty since the loop iterates over all its elements. The variable `c` will be reset to 0, and `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of any subarray in the original list `l`.
