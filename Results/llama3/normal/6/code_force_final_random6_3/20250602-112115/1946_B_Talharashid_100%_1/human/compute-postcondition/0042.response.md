To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `l` to reflect this.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`**
