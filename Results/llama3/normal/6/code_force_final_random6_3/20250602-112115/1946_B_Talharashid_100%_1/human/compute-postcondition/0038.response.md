The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and objects involved:

*   `k` is an integer.
*   `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` that can be obtained by adding the elements from left to right, stopping at each negative element that would cause the sum to become negative. Since `l` is an empty list, `maxi` is 0.
*   `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` is 0.

Now, let's evaluate the expression:

*   `2 ** k` is 2 raised to the power of `k`, which is an integer.
*   `2 ** k * maxi` is the product of `2 ** k` and `maxi`, which is 0 since `maxi` is 0.
*   `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` is the difference between `2 ** k * maxi` and `maxi`, which is 0 since both terms are 0.
*   `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` is the sum of `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` and `sum(l)`, which is 0 since both terms are 0.
*   `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is the result of the expression modulo 1000000007, which is 0 since the expression evaluates to 0.

Output: **0**
