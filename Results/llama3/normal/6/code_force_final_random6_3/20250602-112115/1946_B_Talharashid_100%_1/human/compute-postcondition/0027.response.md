Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is equal to `ele` and `maxi` is equal to `ele`.***
