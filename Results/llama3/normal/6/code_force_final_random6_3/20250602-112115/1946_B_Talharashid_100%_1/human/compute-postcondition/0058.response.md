To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. `i` is 2: This value is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
2. `n` is an integer: The value of `n` is not specified, but it's also not used in the print statement, so it doesn't impact the output.
3. `k` is an integer: The value of `k` is not specified, but it is used in the print statement. We'll consider its impact later.
4. `l` is an empty list: The sum of an empty list is 0.
5. `c` is 0: This value is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
6. `maxi` is 0: This value is used in the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)`

- `2 ** k`: This expression calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is an integer, this will result in an integer value.
- `maxi` is 0, so `2 ** k * maxi` will be 0.
- `maxi` is subtracted from the previous result, which is 0, so the result remains 0.
- `sum(l)` is 0 because `l` is an empty list.
- The entire expression is then taken modulo 1000000007, which is a large prime number. Since the expression evaluates to 0, the result of the modulo operation is also 0.

Output: **0**
