Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of its original value and the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`.***
