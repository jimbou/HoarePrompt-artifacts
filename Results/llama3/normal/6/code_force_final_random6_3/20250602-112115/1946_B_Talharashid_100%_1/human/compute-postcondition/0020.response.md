To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of the input value.

The current state is:

* `i` is 0
* `n` is an integer
* `k` is an integer
* `l` is an empty list
* `c` is 0
* `maxi` is 0

To determine the next state, we need to consider what happens when `i` increments by 1. Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the input value. Therefore, the input value must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi`) are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, and the input value must be greater than 1**
