To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `i` and the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

The input value is an integer, but its value is not specified. However, we know that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the input value. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the input value must be greater than 1.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` that can be obtained by adding the elements from left to right, stopping at each negative element that would cause the sum to become negative, and the input value must be greater than 1**
