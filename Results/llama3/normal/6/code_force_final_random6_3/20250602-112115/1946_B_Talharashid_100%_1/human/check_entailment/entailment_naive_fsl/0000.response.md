Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array contains all negative numbers and k is greater than 1. In this case, the program will not be able to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, because it only considers the maximum sum of the array without any operations and the sum of the array with all elements multiplied by 2^k. However, the problem statement allows for the selection of any contiguous subarray and insertion of its sum anywhere in the array, which can result in a larger sum than what the program calculates.

For example, if the input is:

3 2
-4 -7 -10

The program will output:

-21

However, the correct output should be:

999999996

Because we can select the empty subarray twice and insert its sum (0) anywhere in the array, resulting in a sum of -4 + -7 + -10 + 0 + 0 = -21, which is equivalent to 999999996 modulo 10^9 + 7.
