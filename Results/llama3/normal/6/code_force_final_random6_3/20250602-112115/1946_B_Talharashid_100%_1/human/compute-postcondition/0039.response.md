Output: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` that can be obtained by adding the elements from left to right, stopping at each negative element that would cause the sum to become negative, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` which is equal to `(2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007` which is equal to `0`**
