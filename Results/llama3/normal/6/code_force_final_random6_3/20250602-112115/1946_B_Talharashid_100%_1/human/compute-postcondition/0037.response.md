Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` that can be obtained by adding the elements from left to right, stopping at each negative element that would cause the sum to become negative.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 0, which is the current value of `c`. Since `l` is an empty list, the maximum cumulative sum is 0. Therefore, `maxi` is now 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
