Postcondition: **i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ele is the second element in the list l. If ele is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to c, then maxi is the maximum value between c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the updated c and the original maxi.**
