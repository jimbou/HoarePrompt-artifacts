The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is an integer and `maxi` is also an integer, the value of `maxi` will be updated to the maximum of these two values. The second line assigns 0 to `c`, effectively resetting its value.

Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ele is the third element in the list l, c is 0, maxi is the maximum of its original value and the original value of c**
