Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains several test cases minus 2 inputs. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`***
