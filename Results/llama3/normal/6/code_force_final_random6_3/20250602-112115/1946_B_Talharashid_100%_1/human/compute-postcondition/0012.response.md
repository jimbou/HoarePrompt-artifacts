To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for ele in l:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of list `l`. The only variables in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, and `l` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `ele` must be the third element in the list.

The other variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is an integer**
