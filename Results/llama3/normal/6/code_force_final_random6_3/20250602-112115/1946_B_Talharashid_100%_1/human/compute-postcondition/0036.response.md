Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` that can be obtained by adding the elements from left to right, stopping at each negative element that would cause the sum to become negative.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` is exhausted, and the variable `c` is reset to 0. The variable `maxi` holds the maximum cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` that can be obtained by adding the elements from left to right, stopping at each negative element that would cause the sum to become negative. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
