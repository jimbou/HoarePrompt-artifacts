Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is an integer equal to its original value plus `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and its original value.***
