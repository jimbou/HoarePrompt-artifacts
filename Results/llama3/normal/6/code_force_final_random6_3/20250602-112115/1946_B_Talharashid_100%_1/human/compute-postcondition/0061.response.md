Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a result for each test case by iterating through the integers, keeping track of the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers and the sum of all integers. It then prints the result of an expression involving the maximum sum, the sum of all integers, and the values of k and n, modulo 1000000007. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and returns no value.**
