Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `maxi` and the original value of `c`. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of its original value and `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and its original value.***
