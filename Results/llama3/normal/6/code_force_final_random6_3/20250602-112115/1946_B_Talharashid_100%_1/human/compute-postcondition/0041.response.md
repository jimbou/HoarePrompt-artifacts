Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` are updated based on the code execution. The input values for `n` and `k` are read from stdin, and `l` is populated with a list of integers. The value of `c` is reset to 0, and `maxi` is also reset to 0. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been read.
