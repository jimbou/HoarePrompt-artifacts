Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `maxi` is assigned the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
2. Since `c` is 0, the maximum value will be either 0 or the current value of `maxi`.
3. The value of `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray in `l`, which is an empty list. Therefore, the maximum sum is 0.
4. So, `maxi` will be assigned the value 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. The list `l` is still empty. The maximum sum of subarray in `l` is now explicitly set to 0, which is the expected value for an empty list.
