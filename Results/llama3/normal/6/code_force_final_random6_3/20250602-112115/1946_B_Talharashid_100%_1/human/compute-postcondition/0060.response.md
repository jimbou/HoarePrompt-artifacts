Output State: **`i` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, and the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it has calculated and printed the result of the given expression. The loop variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` have been updated accordingly, and the input has been fully consumed (i.e., stdin contains 0 inputs).
