Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the original value of `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and its original value.***
