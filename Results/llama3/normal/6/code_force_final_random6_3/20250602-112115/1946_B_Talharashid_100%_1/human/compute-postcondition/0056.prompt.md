Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains 0 inputs, ele is the first element in the list l. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum of the original value of c and the original value of maxi, and c remains 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of its original value and the first element in the list l, and maxi is the maximum value between c and its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ele is the second element in the list l. If ele is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to c, then maxi is the maximum value between c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the updated c and the original maxi.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ele is the third element in the list l. If ele is negative and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the updated c and its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
