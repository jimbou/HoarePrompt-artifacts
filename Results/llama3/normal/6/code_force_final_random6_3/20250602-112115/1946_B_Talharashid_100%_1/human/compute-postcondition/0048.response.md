According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list l. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the ele is the second element in the list.
State: **i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains 0 inputs, ele is the second element in the list l.**
