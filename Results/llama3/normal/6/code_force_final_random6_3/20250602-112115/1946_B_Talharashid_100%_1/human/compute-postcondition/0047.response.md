Postcondition: ***i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains 0 inputs, ele is the first element in the list l. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum of the original value of c and the original value of maxi, and c remains 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of its original value and the first element in the list l, and maxi is the maximum value between c and its original value.***
