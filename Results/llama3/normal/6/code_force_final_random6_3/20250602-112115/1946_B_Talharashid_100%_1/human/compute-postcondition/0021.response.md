Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains no input**.

The code snippet consists of four lines, each of which affects the state of the program in a specific way. Here's a brief description of the impact of each line:

1. `n, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since the input value must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` will be integers greater than 1. The input is now empty.

2. `l = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `l`. Since the input is empty after the first line, this line will not read any input, and `l` will remain an empty list.

3. `c = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to `c`.

4. `maxi = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to `maxi`.

After executing all the lines, the state of the program is as follows:

* `i` remains unchanged at 1.
* `n` and `k` are integers greater than 1, assigned from the input.
* `l` is an empty list, as no input was read in the second line.
* `c` is 0, assigned in the third line.
* `maxi` is 0, assigned in the fourth line.
* The input is empty, as all input values have been read and assigned to variables.

Therefore, the final output state is: **i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is an empty list, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains no input**.
