To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. `i` is 0.
2. `n` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided.
3. `k` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided.
4. `l` is an empty list.
5. `c` is 0.
6. `maxi` is 0.

Now, let's break down the expression inside the print statement:

- `2 ** k`: This calculates 2 to the power of `k`. Since `k` is an integer, this will result in an integer value, but without knowing `k`, we can't compute the exact value.
- `maxi`: This is 0, as per the initial state.
- `sum(l)`: Since `l` is an empty list, the sum of its elements is 0.

Putting it all together, the expression becomes:

`(2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007`

This simplifies to:

`0 % 1000000007`

Which is simply `0`, because any number modulo 1000000007 will be 0 if the number itself is 0.

Therefore, regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k`, the output of the print statement will always be `0` due to the initial values of `maxi` and the empty list `l`.

Output: **0**
