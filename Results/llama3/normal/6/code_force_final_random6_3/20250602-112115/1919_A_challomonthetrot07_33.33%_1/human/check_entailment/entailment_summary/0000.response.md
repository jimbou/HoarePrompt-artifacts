Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. The program checks all possible conditions and determines the winner based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The conditions are checked in the correct order, and the program prints the winner's name for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible scenarios. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check for even and odd numbers is correct, and the program handles the cases where Alice or Bob has only one coin correctly.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
