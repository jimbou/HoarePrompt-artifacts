The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `T`. If `i` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `T` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is at least 3, i is 2, a and b are integers, and stdin is empty. If a is equal to b, 'Bob' is printed. If a is not equal to b, then if a is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If a is not 1, then if b is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If b is not 1, then if a is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If a is even, then if b is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if a is greater than b, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**
