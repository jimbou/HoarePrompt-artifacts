Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers**

In this output state, the values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` to the integers obtained from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin is now empty, so it is not included in the output state.
