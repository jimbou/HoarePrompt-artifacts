The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` accepts a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin is now empty, we won't include it in the output state.

Output State: **`T` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers, and stdin is empty.**
