This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then determines the winner of each case based on a set of predefined rules and prints the winner's name. The rules are as follows: if the number of coins is equal, Bob wins; if Alice has one coin, she wins; if Bob has one coin, he wins; if Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob wins; if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number, Alice wins; if Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The function processes all test cases and prints the winner for each case.
