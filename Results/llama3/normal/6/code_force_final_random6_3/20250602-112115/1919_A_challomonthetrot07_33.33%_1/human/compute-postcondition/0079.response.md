Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `i` is `T-1`, `a` and `b` are integers, `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, If `a` is equal to `b`, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then if `a` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `T` remains unchanged, stdin is empty because all input lines have been processed, and `i` has reached its final value of `T-1`. The values of `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The conditions for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' remain the same as in the previous iterations, based on the values of `a` and `b`.
