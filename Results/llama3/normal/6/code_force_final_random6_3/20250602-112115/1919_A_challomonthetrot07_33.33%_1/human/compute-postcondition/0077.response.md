Postcondition: **T is at least 3, i is 2, a and b are integers, a and b are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, stdin is empty. If a is equal to b, 'Bob' is printed. If a is not equal to b, then if a is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If a is not 1, then if b is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If b is not 1, then if a is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If a is even, then if b is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If a is greater than b, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed. If a is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If a is not 1 and b is 1, 'Bob' is printed.**
