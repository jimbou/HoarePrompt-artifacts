Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, i is 0, a and b are integers, and a is not equal to b. If a is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If a is not 1, then if b is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If a is odd and b is not 1, 'Bob' is printed. If a is even and b is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If a is even and b is even, then if a is greater than b, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.***
