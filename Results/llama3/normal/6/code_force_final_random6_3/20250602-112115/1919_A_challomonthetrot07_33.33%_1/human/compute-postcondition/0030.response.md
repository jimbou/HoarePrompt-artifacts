Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and `a` is even. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is odd or `b` is even, then if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.***
