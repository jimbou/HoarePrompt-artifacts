The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. 

In the initial state, the standard input contains multiple lines of input, with the first line containing a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

After executing the code, the value of `T` is assigned the value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The standard input now contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `T` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
