Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, but the program does not consider all possible moves and their outcomes.

For example, when a = 3 and b = 3, the program will print 'Bob', but the correct outcome is 'Alice'. This is because Alice can swap wallets with Bob, making a = 3 and b = 3, and then remove 1 coin from her wallet, making a = 2 and b = 3. Then, Bob can only remove 1 coin from his wallet, making a = 2 and b = 2. Finally, Alice can swap wallets with Bob again, making a = 2 and b = 2, and then remove 1 coin from her wallet, making a = 1 and b = 2. At this point, Bob cannot make a valid move, so Alice wins.

The program does not consider this sequence of moves and incorrectly determines the winner. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
