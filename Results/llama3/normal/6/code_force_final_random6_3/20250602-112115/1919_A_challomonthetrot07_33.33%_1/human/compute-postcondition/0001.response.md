The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`T` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
