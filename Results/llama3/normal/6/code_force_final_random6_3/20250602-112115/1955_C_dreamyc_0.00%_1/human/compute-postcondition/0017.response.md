Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2, n-1 or n positive integers, ans is 0, 1 or 2, a is a positive integer or 0, b is a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a > 0, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x, and k is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the deque nums now contains the value of a at its leftmost position and if b > 0, then b is at its rightmost position. If a is 0, then ans is 1, and x is 0.***
