Output State: **n is at least 2, k is greater than or equal to -4x, nums is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 0, 1 or 2, a is a positive integer equal to its original value minus x, b is a positive integer equal to its original value minus x, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a > 0, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x, and k is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the deque nums now contains the value of a at its leftmost position and if b > 0, then b is at its rightmost position. If a is 0, then ans is 1, and x is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been decreased by `x`, and `k` has been decreased by `2 * x`. The value of `x` remains the same, which is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The deque `nums` and the variables `n`, `ans` remain unchanged.
