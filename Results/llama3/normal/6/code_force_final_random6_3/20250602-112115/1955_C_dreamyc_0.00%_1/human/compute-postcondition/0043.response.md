Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, k is 0, nums is a deque of n-2i, n-2i+1 or n-2i+2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, a is a positive integer or 0, b is a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. Additionally, either k is 0, or len(nums) is not 1, or k is less than nums[0].***
