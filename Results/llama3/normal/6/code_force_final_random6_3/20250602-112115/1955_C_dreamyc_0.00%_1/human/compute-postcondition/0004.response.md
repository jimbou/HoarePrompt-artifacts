Output State: **n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 positive integers, ans is 0, a is a positive integer equal to its original value minus x, b is a positive integer equal to its original value minus x, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, k is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`, which is the minimum of their original values. The value of `k` is reduced by twice the value of `x`, but it remains a positive integer. The relationship between `k` and `x` is maintained, with `k` being greater than or equal to 0.
