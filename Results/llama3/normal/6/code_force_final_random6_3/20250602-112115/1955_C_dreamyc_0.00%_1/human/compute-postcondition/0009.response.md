Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of n-1 positive integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `a` is greater than 0, and the deque `nums` now contains the value of `a` at its leftmost position.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been added to the left of the deque `nums`, increasing its size by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are still valid.
