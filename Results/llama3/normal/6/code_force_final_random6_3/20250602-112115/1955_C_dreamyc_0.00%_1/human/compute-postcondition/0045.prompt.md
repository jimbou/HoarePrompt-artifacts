You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, and nums is a list of n positive integers.
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: n is at least 2, k is 0, nums is a deque of n-2i, n-2i+1 or n-2i+2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, a is a positive integer or 0, b is a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, and i is a positive integer.
    #State: *n is at least 2, k is 0, nums is a deque of n-2i, n-2i+1 or n-2i+2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, a is a positive integer or 0, b is a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. Additionally, either k is 0, or len(nums) is not 1, or k is less than nums[0].
    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is equal to 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, where i is an integer and n is at least 2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns ans + 1, where ans is 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, and i is a positive integer.

Case_2: The program returns ans which is equal to 2i, 2i+1 or 2i+2, where i is an integer and n is at least 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
