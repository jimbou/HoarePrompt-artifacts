Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than or equal to -4x, `nums` is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is 1, 2, 3 or 4, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` > 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the deque `nums` now contains the value of `a` at its leftmost position and if `b` > 0, then `b` is at its rightmost position. If `a` is 0, then `ans` is 1, and `x` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `a`, `b`, `k`, and `x` are still valid.
