To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `nums` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `k` being greater than 0 and `len(nums)` being greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to -4x, `nums` is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0.

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 0, and `len(nums)` must be greater than or equal to 2. Since `k` is greater than or equal to -4x, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 0. Also, since `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0, we need to adjust `len(nums)` to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
