Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, `a` is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from nums, `b` is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from nums, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a and b, a is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b, and b is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `k` remains greater than 0, the length of `nums` is increased by 1 and it is now a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers, `ans` remains the same, `a` and `b` remain the same, and `x` remains the same. The condition regarding `k`, `a`, and `b` remains the same.
