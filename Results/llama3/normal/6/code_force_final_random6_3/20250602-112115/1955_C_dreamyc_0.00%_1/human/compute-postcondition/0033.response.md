Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of n-5, n-4 or n-3 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, a is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from nums, b is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from nums, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a and b, a is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b, and b is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
