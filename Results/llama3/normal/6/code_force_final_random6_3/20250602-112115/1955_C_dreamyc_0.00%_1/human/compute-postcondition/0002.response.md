The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line removes the first and last elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The second line calculates the minimum value between `a` and `b` and assigns it to `x`.

Output State: **n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 positive integers, ans is 0, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b**
