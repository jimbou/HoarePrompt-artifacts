The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so the new value of `ans` is 1. The other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` positive integers, `ans` is 1, `a` is 0, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is 0 (since `x` is equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `a` is 0)**
