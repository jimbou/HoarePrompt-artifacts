Output State: **n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a and b, nums is a deque of n-5, n-4 or n-3 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, a is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from nums minus the minimum of a and b, b is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from nums minus the minimum of a and b, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`. The first line decrements `a` by the value of `x`, which is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The second line decrements `b` by the value of `x`. The third line decrements `k` by twice the value of `x`. The values of `n`, `nums`, `ans` remain unchanged.
