Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of n-5, n-4 or n-3 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, `a` is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from nums, `b` is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from nums, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
