Output State: **n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 positive integers, ans is 0, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, k is less than 2 times x, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables n, k, nums, ans, a, b, and x remain unchanged. The only change is that the program will exit the current loop or if statement, so we add that information to the output state.
