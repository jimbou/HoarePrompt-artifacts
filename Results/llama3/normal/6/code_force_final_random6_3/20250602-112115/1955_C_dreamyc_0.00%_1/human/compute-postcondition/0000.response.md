Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is a double-ended queue data structure. This means that `nums` can now be efficiently appended or popped from both ends. The second line initializes a new variable `ans` and assigns it the value 0.

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The list `nums` is converted into a deque, but its contents remain the same, consisting of `n` positive integers. The new variable `ans` is introduced with a value of 0.
