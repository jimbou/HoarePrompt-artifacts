Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2, n-1 or n positive integers, ans is 0, 1 or 2, a is a positive integer or 0, b is a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a > 0, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x, and k is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the deque nums now contains the value of a at its leftmost position and if b > 0, then b is at its rightmost position. If a is 0, then ans is 1, and x is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than or equal to -4x, `nums` is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` > 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the deque `nums` now contains the value of `a` at its leftmost position and if `b` > 0, then `b` is at its rightmost position. If `a` is 0, then `ans` is 1, and `x` is 0. If `b` > 0, then the deque `nums` now contains the value of `b` at its rightmost position. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, 2, 3 or 4.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of n-4, n-3 or n-2 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 1, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, a is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from nums, b is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from nums, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a and b, a is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b, and b is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of n-5, n-4 or n-3 positive integers and len(nums) is greater than or equal to 0, ans is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, a is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from nums, b is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from nums, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a and b, a is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b, and b is updated to its original value minus the minimum of a and b. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
