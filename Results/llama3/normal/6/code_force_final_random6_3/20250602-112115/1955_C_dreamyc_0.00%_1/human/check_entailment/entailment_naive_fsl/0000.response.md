Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to simulate the Kraken's attack on the ships. It uses a deque to efficiently remove and add ships from the front and back of the queue. The program correctly handles the cases where the Kraken's attack reduces the durability of the ships, and it also correctly handles the case where a ship's durability drops to 0 and it sinks.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there is only one ship left, or when the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink any ships.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
