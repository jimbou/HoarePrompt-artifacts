Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of n-1 or n positive integers, `ans` is 0 or 1, `a` is a positive integer or 0, `b` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` > 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the deque `nums` now contains the value of `a` at its leftmost position and `b` at its rightmost position. If `a` is 0, then `ans` is 1, and `x` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number `n` is at least 2, and `k` is a positive integer. The deque `nums` now contains `b` at its rightmost position and has a length of `n-1` or `n`. The values of `ans`, `a`, and `x` remain the same as before, but the value of `b` is now part of the deque `nums`. If `a` is greater than 0, then the conditions related to `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` still apply. If `a` is 0, then `ans` is 1, and `x` is 0.
