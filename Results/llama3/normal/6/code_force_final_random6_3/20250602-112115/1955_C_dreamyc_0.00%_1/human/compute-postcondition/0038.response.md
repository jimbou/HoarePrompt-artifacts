Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of `n-4`, `n-3` or `n-2` positive integers and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, `a` is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from `nums`, `b` is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from `nums`, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to its original value minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is updated to its original value minus the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not greater than 0, then `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of `n-5`, `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `a` is a positive integer equal to the value of the leftmost element that was removed from `nums`, `b` is a positive integer equal to the value of the rightmost element that was removed from `nums`, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to its original value minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is updated to its original value minus the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for updating `k`, `a`, and `b` based on the minimum of `a` and `b` are still valid. If `a` is not greater than 0, the conditions for updating `n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are still valid.
