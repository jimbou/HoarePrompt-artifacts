According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, cnt is 0, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, cnt is 0, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0**
