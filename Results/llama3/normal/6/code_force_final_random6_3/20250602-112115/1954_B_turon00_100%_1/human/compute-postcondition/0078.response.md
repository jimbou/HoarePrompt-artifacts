Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin is empty, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and ans has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and cnt which is 0. If n is 1 or n is equal to ans, -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of t has been decremented to 0. The values of n, a, tmp, i, cnt, and ans have been updated according to the loop's logic. The stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The final values of ans and cnt are printed according to the conditions specified in the loop.
