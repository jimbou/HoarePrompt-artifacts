Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.***
