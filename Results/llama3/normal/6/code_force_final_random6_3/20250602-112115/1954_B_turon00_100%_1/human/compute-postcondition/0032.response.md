Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans, and a[i] is not equal to tmp**

The code first assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0. Then, it resets `cnt` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
