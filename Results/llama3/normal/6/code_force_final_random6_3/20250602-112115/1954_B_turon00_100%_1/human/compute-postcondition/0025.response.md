Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and ans has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and cnt which is 0. If n is 1 or n is equal to ans, -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans is printed.***
