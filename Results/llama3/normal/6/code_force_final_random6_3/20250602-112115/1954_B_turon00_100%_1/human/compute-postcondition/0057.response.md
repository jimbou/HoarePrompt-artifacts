Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and 0, cnt is 0, and a[i] is not equal to tmp. If n is 1 or equal to ans, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original ans and 0 is printed.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line updates `ans` to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, which is 0. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0, effectively setting `ans` to 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
