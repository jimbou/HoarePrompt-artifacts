Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and cnt is 0.**

The code snippet updates the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
