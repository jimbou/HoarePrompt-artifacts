Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is n, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If a[i] is equal to tmp, then cnt is either 1 or 2. If a[i] is not equal to tmp, then cnt is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If a[i] is equal to tmp, then cnt is either 2 or 3. If a[i] is not equal to tmp, then cnt is either 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
