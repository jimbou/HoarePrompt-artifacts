Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and ans has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and cnt which is 0. If n is 1 or n is equal to ans, -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
