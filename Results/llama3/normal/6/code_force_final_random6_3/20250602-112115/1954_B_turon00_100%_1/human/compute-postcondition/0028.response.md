To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) and `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`**
