To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it has been incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Since `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can ignore it. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt` which is 0. If `n` is 1 or `n` is equal to `ans`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.**
