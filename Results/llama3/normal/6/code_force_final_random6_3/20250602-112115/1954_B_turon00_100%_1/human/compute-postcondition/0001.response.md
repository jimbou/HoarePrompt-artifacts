To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need a specific value). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to specify that `_` is 0, as it will take on the value of the current iteration starting from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases, _ is 0**
