Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
