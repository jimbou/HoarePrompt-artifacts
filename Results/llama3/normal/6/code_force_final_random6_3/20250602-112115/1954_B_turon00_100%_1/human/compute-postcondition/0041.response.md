Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If a[i] is equal to tmp, then cnt is either 2 or 3. If a[i] is not equal to tmp, then cnt is either 0 or 1.***
