Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the loop counter `i` has reached the end of the list `a` (i.e., `i` is equal to `n`), the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` has been reset to 0 (i.e., `cnt` is 0), and the answer `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
