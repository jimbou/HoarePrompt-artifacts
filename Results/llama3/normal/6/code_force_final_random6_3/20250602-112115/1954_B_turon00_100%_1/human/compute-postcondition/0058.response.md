Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and the minimum of the original `ans` and 0 is printed. In both cases, the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed.**
