Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and cnt is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a. If a[i] is equal to tmp, then cnt is the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a is printed. If a[i] is not equal to tmp, then cnt is 0 and the minimum of the original ans and 0 is printed. In both cases, the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If n is 1 or equal to ans, then -1 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged, an integer between 3 and 10^4.
* The value of `n` is now greater than or equal to 0, as the loop has executed all iterations.
* The value of `a` remains unchanged, a list of integers.
* The value of `tmp` remains unchanged, an integer.
* The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-3` test cases.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, as the loop has executed all iterations.
* The value of `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`.
* The value of `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`.
* If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.
* If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and the minimum of the original `ans` and 0 is printed.
* In both cases, the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed.
