Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and the minimum of the original `ans` and 0 is printed. In both cases, the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `cnt` is now either 1 or 2, depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. The minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed, and the value of `n` is printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed.
