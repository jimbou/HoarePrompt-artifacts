Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, cnt is 0, ans is an integer equal to the minimum of its original value and 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0, and a[i] is not equal to tmp**

The code first assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0. Then, it resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected.
