The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and the minimum of the original `ans` and 0 is printed. In both cases, the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed.**
