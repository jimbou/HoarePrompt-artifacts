Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet updates the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `ans` will be either the original `ans` or 0, depending on the original value of `ans`. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected.
