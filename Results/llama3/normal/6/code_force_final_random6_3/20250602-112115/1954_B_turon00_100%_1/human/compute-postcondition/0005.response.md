Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `tmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of `a[i]` remains equal to the current value of `tmp`.
