Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If n is 1 or equal to ans, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a is printed, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, assigns it to `a`, and reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The first element of `a` is assigned to `tmp`. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and `ans` is set to the value of `n`. The value of `n` is printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`, otherwise -1 is printed. The minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is also printed. The variable `i` remains unchanged, still equal to `n`.
