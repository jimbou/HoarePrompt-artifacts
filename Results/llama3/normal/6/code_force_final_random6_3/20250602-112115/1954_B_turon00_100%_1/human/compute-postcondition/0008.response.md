Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. If the current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of tmp, then cnt is 1. Otherwise, ans is the minimum of its original value and 0, and cnt remains 0.***
