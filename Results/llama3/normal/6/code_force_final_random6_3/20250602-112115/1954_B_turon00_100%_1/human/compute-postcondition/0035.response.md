Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
