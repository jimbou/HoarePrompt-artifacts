Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.***
