Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and cnt is 0.**

The code snippet updates the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its original value and 0 or 1. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`, otherwise -1 has been printed.
