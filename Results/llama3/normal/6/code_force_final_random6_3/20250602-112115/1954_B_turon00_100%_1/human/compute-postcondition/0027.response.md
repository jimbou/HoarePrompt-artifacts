Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is n, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans.**

The code executes as follows:

1. `n = int(input())`: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. Since `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` can take any integer value. The value of `n` is printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`.

2. `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))`: The value of `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input. The input is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces and split into a list of integers.

3. `tmp = a[0]`: The value of `tmp` is updated to the first element of the list `a`.

4. `cnt = 0`: The value of `cnt` is updated to 0.

5. `ans = n`: The value of `ans` is updated to the value of `n`.

The final state includes the updated values of `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `stdin` now contains `t-3` test cases. The value of `i` is still `n`, and the value of `ans` has been updated to `n`. If `n` is 1 or `n` is equal to `ans`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `ans` is printed.
