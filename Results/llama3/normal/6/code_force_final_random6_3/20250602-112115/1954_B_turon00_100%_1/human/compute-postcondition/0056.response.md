Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If n is 1 or equal to ans, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a is printed, cnt is 0, and a[i] is not equal to tmp***
