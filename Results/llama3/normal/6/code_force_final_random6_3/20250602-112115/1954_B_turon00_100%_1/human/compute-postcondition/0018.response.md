Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and ans has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and cnt which is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still between 1 and 10^4, n is still an integer, a is still a list of integers, tmp is still an integer, stdin still contains t-1 test cases, i is still n, cnt is still 0, and ans has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, which is now the minimum of its original value and 0.
