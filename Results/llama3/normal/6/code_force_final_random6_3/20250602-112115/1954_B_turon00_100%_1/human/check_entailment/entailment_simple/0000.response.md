Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. It updates the answer with the minimum count found so far. If the array has only one element or if the minimum count is equal to the length of the array, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
