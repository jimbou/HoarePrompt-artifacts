Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.***
