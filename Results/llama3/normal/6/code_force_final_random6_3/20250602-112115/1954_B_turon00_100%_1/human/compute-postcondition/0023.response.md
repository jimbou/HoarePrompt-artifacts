The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in list `a`. Since `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt` which is 0, and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the value of `ans` is 0.

Output: **0**
