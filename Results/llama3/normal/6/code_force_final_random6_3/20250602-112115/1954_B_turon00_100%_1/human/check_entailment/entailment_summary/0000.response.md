Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element. If the minimum count is equal to the length of the array or the array contains only one element, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

Correctness: **True**
