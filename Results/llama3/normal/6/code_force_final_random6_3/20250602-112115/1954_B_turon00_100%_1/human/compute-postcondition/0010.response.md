Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1, `cnt` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains the same, which is `t-1`.
