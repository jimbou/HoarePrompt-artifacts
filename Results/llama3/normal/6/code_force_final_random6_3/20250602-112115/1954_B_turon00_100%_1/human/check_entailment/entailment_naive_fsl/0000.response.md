Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only two distinct elements, and the minimum count of consecutive elements of the same type is 1. In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct answer is -1, because removing one element will not make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 1, 2]. The program will output 1, but the correct answer is -1, because removing one element will not make the array non-beautiful.

The program only checks if the minimum count of consecutive elements of the same type is equal to the length of the array, but it does not consider the case where the minimum count is 1 and the array contains only two distinct elements.
