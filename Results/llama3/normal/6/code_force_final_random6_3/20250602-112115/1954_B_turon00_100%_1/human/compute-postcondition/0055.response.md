Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `cnt` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`. The value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now 1. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and conditions.
