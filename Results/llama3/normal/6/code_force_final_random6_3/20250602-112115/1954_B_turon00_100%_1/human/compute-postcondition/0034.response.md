The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
