The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, the value of `ans` will be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`.**
