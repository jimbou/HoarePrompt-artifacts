This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first integer in the list. If the list contains only one element or the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the length of the list, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.
