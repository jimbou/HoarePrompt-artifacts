The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `t-3` and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` is `t-2` and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than `t-2` or `t` is greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and the value of `n` has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to `ans`. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.**
