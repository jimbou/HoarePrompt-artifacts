Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `ans` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.***
