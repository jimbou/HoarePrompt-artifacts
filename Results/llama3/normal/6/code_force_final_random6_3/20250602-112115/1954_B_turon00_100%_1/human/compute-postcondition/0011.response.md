Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt, cnt is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` and `cnt` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume they have some initial values. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
