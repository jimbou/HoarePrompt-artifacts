Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array `a`. This is because the array is beautiful, and the first element is the one that needs to be checked for consecutive occurrences.

2. The program then iterates through the array, keeping a count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the variable `cnt`. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

3. After the loop, the program updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `cnt` one last time, to account for the case where the last element of the array is `tmp`.

4. The program then checks if `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n`. If either condition is true, it prints -1, because in these cases, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

5. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array has only one element or where all elements are the same.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
