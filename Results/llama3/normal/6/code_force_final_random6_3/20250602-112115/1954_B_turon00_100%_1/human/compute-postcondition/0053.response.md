The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If n is 1 or equal to ans, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a is printed, cnt is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the value of n must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If n is 1 or equal to ans, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original ans and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a is printed, cnt is 0**
