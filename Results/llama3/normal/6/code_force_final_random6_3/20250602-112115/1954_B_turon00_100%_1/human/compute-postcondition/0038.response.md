The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans. If a[i] is equal to tmp, then cnt is either 1 or 2. If a[i] is not equal to tmp, then cnt is either 0 or 1.**
