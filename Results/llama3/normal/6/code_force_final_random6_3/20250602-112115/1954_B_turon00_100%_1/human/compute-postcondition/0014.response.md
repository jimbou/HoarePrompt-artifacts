Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-1`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` are the same as before.
