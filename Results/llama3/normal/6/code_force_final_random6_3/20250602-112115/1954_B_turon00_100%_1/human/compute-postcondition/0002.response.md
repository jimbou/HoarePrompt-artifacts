Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, cnt is 0, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input. The list `a` is populated with a list of integers from the input. The variable `tmp` is assigned the first element of the list `a`, which is an integer. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an integer. The variable `_` remains unchanged, still 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
