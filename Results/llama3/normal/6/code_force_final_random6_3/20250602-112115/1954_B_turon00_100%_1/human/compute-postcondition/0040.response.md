Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and the value of n has been printed if it is not 1 and not equal to ans, cnt is 0**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line updates `ans` to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1 when `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, and either 1 or 2 when `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its original value and one of these values. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
