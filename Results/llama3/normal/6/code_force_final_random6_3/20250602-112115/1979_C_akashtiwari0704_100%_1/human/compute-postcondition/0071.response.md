Output State: **`bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a` divided by the original value at index `i`, `sumo` is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a` divided by the original value at index `i` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is 2, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(l)` elements, `g` is 1, `i` is `bets - 1`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still has at least `len(l)` elements, and `i` is still equal to `bets - 1`. The input stream remains empty.
