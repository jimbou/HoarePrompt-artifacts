Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in a given list 'l'. It takes no parameters and returns the LCM of the list elements. The function assumes that the input list 'l' has at least one element. The function does not modify the input list or any other variables. It only performs calculations to determine the LCM and returns the result.**
