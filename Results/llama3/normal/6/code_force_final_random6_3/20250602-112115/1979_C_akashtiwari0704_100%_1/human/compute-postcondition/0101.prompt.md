Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is 0, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is bets - 1, stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod, ans is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is at least 1, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 0, stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the value of a[0] followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is at least 2, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 1, stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the value of a[0] followed by a space and the value of a[1] followed by a space and the value of a[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is at least 3, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 2, stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the value of a[0] followed by a space and the value of a[1] followed by a space and the value of a[i] followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
