The code prints a string containing the values of a[0] through a[bets-1] each followed by a space. Where a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is equal to the number of iterations, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, and i is bets - 1.
