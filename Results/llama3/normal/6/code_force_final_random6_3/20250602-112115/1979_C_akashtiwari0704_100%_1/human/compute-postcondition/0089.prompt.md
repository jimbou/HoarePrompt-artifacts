Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to the input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index, `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is 2, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(l)` elements, `g` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `l`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: bets is greater than 0, a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 0, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // a[i] and then incremented by 1, bets is greater than 1, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 1, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // a[i] + 1), bets is greater than 2, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i], t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 2, stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
