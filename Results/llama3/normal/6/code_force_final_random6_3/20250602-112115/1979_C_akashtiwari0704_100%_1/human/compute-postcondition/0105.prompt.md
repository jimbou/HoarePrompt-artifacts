Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains the remaining test cases, with the first test case partially read (only the first line).
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, bets is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], l is a list of integers, g is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in l, i is bets - 1. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans is a string that contains the string representation of all elements of a followed by a space, and the string representation of all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: bets is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i for all i in range(bets), prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 1, T is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is bets - 1, stdin contains no input. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of a[0] followed by a space followed by the value of a[1] followed by a space followed by the value of a[2] followed by a space followed by the value of a[3] followed by a space is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is either 0 or equal to the number of iterations, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is bets - 1, stdin contains no input. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the values of a[0] through a[bets-1] each followed by a space, and this string is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
