Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, T is t - 1, bets is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is bets - 1, stdin contains no input. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the values of a[0] through a[bets-1] each followed by a space, and this string is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variable `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `T` is equal to `t - 1`.
- The variable `bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to the original value of `bets`.
- The list `a` contains integers where each value is the input integer at that index, except for the value at index `i` which is now the result of repeatedly dividing the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a` by the original value at index `i`, with `bets` number of iterations.
- The variable `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`.
- The variable `sumo` is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a` divided by the value at index `i`, plus the value at index `i`, plus the result of repeatedly dividing the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a` by the original value at index `i`, with `bets` number of iterations.
- The list `l` contains integers that must have at least `len(l)` elements.
- The variable `g` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `l`.
- The variable `i` is equal to `bets - 1`.
- The standard input `stdin` contains no input.
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and a string containing the values of `a[0]` through `a[bets-1]` each followed by a space is printed.
