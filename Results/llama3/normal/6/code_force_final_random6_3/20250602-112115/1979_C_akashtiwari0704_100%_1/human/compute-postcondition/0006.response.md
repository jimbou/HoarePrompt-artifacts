Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and `l[0]` and `l[1]`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of its initial value and `l[1]`, in addition to being the least common multiple of its initial value and `l[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
