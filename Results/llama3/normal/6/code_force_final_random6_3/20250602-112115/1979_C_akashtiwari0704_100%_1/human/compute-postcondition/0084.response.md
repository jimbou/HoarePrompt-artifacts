Output State: **bets is greater than 0, a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `a` at index `i` has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` has been incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
