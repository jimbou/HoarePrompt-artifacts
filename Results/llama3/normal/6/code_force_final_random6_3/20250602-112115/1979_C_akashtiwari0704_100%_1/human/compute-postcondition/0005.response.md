The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `len(l)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `l` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and `l[0]`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
