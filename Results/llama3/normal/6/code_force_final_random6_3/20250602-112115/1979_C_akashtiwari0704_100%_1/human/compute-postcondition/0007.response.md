To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(l)):`. The objects involved are `i` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` must have at least 2 elements.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and `l[0]` and `l[1]`, `l` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
