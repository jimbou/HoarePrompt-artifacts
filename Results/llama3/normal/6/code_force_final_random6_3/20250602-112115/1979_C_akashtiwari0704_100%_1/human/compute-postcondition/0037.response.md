To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of list `l`. If `l` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the new value of `a[i]`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `g` is 1, `i` is 0**
