Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and all elements in `l`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`.**

The code first assigns an integer value from stdin to `bets`. Then, it assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line calculates the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a` using the `lcm` function and assigns it to `prod`. The fourth line initializes `sumo` to 0. The variables `t`, `T`, `l`, `g`, and `i` are not modified by the code, so they retain their initial values.
