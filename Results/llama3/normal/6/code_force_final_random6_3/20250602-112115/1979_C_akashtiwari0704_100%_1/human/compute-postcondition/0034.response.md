Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, bets is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], l is a list of integers, g is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in l, i is bets - 1. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans is a string that contains the string representation of all elements of a followed by a space, and the string representation of all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.**
