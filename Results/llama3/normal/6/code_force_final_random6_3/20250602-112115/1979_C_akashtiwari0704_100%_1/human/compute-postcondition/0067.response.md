The code prints the string `ans` which contains the values of the first four elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.
Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the string `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string `ans` containing the values of the first four elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.
Output: **a[0] a[1] a[2] a[3] (where a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3] are the first four elements of the list a)**
