The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If l is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, and g is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
