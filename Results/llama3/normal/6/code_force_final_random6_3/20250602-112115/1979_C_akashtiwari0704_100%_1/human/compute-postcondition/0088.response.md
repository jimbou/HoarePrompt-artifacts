Output State: **a is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // a[i] + 1), bets is greater than 2, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i], t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // (prod // a[i] + 1)`, and `sumo` has been incremented by `prod // a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
