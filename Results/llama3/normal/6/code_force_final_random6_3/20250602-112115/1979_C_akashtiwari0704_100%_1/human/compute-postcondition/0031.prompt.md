Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], `l` is a list of integers, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in `l`, `i` is bets - 1, `sumo` is less than prod, and `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], `l` is a list of integers, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is less than prod, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the first element of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], `l` is a list of integers, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is less than prod, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the first two elements of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], `l` is a list of integers, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in `l`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is less than prod, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the first three elements of `a` followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
