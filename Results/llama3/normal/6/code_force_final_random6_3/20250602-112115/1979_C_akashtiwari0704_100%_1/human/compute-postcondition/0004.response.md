Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and `l[0]`, `l` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of its initial value (which was 1) and the value of `l[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
