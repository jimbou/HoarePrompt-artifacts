Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, bets is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], l is a list of integers, g is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in l, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` has been incremented by the new value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
