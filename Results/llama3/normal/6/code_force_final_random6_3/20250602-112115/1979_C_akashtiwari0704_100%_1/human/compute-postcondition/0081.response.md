Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in a given list of integers 'l', which must have at least 'len(l)' elements. The function does not modify the input list 'l' or any other input variables. It only computes the LCM of the elements in 'l' and returns this value.**
