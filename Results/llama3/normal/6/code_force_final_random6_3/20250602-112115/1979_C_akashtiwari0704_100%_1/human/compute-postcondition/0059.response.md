Output State: **`bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i, `sumo` is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i for all i in range(bets), `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, `g` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, `i` is bets - 1, `ans` is an empty string, stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values are still valid.
