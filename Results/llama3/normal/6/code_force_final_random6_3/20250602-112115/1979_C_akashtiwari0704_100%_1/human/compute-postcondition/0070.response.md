The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 1, t is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, T must be increased by 1, so T is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **bets is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i for all i in range(bets), prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is bets - 1, stdin contains no input.**
