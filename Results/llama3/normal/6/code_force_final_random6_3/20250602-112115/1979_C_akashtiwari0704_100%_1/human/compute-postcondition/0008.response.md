Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and `l[0]` and `l[1]` and `l[2]`, `l` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and `l[0]` and `l[1]` and `l[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still has at least 3 elements, and the value of `i` is still 2.
