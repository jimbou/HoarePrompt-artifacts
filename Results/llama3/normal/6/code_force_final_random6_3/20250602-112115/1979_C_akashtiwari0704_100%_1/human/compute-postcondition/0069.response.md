Postcondition: **bets is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i for all i in range(bets), prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 1, T is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is bets - 1, stdin contains no input. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of a[0] followed by a space followed by the value of a[1] followed by a space followed by the value of a[2] followed by a space followed by the value of a[3] followed by a space is printed.**
