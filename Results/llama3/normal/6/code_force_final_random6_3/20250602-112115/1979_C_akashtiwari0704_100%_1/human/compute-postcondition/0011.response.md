Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers (`l`) and an initial value (`g`), which is set to 1. The function iterates through the list, updating the LCM at each step by multiplying the current LCM (`g`) with the current number in the list (`l[i]`) and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`). The final LCM is returned.**
