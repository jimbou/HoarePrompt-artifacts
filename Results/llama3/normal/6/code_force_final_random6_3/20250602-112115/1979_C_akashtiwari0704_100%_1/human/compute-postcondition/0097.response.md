State: **`a` is a list of integers where each value is the input integer at that index except for the value at index i which is now prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, bets is at least 2, prod is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the value at index i plus the value at index i plus prod // a[i] plus ... plus prod // (prod // (prod // ... (prod // a[i]) ...)) with bets number of iterations, t is an integer greater than 2, T is 2, l is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, g is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, i is 1, stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the value of a[0] followed by a space and the value of a[1]**
