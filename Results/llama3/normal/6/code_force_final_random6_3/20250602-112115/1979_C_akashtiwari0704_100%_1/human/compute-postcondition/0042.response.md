Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the new value of `a[i]`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `g` is the least common multiple of 1, the first element of `l`, and `l[2]`, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of 1, the first element of `l`, and `l[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
