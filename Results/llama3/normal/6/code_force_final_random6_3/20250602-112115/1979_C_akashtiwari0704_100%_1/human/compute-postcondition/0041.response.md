To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `l` must have at least 2 elements, it can still have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the new value of `a[i]`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `g` is the least common multiple of 1, the first element of `l`, and `l[i]`, `i` is 2**
