Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to bets, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is prod // a[i], `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i], `l` is a list of integers, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements in `l`, `i` is bets - 1, `sumo` is less than prod, and `ans` is an empty string.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `ans` is introduced with an empty string value. The conditions and relationships between the variables in the initial state are still valid.
