Output State: **`bets` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index i is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i, `sumo` is the sum of the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a divided by the original value at index i for all i in range(bets), `prod` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in a, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least len(l) elements, `g` is the least common multiple of 1 and all elements in l, `i` is bets - 1, `ans` is a string that contains the value of a[0] followed by a space followed by the value of a[1] followed by a space followed by the value of a[2] followed by a space followed by the value of a[3] followed by a space, and stdin contains no input, and sumo is less than prod.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that `i` is now `bets - 1` and `ans` contains the values of all elements in `a` followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.
