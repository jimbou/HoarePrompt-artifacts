The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `n` and `k`. The expression can be broken down into three parts:

1. `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the value of `k` divided by 2, rounded down (using integer division `//`), plus the remainder of `k` divided by 2 (using the modulo operator `%`). The result is then multiplied by a boolean value (`k < 4 * n - 3`) which is `True` (1) if the condition is met and `False` (0) otherwise.

2. `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the value of `2` multiplied by `n`, multiplied by a boolean value (`k >= 4 * n - 3`) which is `True` (1) if the condition is met and `False` (0) otherwise.

3. `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part checks if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2` and returns `True` (1) if the condition is met and `False` (0) otherwise.

The final result is the sum of these three parts.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **result of the mathematical expression involving n and k**
