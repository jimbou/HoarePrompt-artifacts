Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the fourth line, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least one line less than initially, `open(0)` has at least 0 lines, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`**
