To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the components of the expression and understand their values based on the initial state.

The expression to be printed is:
```python
(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
```
Let's analyze each part:

1. `(k // 2 + k % 2)`: This part calculates a value based on `k`. The `//` operator performs integer division (rounding down to the nearest whole number), and `%` gives the remainder of the division. This expression effectively rounds `k` up to the nearest whole number if `k` is odd (since `k % 2` will be 1 for odd numbers, adding 1 to the result of `k // 2`), and leaves `k` unchanged if `k` is even (since `k % 2` will be 0 for even numbers).

2. `(k < 4 * n - 3)`: This is a conditional expression that evaluates to `True` if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, and `False` otherwise. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0 when used in arithmetic operations.

3. `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: Similar to the previous point, this expression multiplies `2 * n` by a conditional that checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`. The result of the conditional (`True` or `False`) is multiplied by `2 * n`.

4. `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This checks if `k` is exactly equal to `4 * n - 2` and evaluates to `True` (1) if true, and `False` (0) if false.

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `n`, `k`, or `s`, but we can describe the output based on the conditions and operations involved.

- The first term of the expression, `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, will be the value of `k` rounded up to the nearest whole number if `k` is odd, or `k` itself if `k` is even.

- The second term, `(k < 4 * n - 3)`, will be 1 if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, and 0 otherwise.

- The third term, `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`, will be `2 * n` if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`, and 0 otherwise.

- The fourth term, `(k == 4 * n - 2)`, will be 1 if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, and 0 otherwise.

The final output will be the sum of these terms, which depends on the specific values of `k` and `n`. Without explicit values for `k` and `n`, we can't compute an exact numerical value, but we can describe the output as a function of these variables.

Output: **The sum of the rounded up value of k, the conditional check for k being less than 4n-3, twice n if k is greater than or equal to 4n-3, and 1 if k equals 4n-2, otherwise 0**
