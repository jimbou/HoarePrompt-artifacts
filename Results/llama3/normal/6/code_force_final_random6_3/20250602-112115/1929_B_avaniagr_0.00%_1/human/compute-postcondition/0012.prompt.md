Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (
        k == 4 * n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is a combination of conditional statements and arithmetic operations involving the values of `k` and `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the third line, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least one line less than initially, `open(0)` has at least 2 lines, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the fourth line, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least one line less than initially, `open(0)` has at least 0 lines, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
