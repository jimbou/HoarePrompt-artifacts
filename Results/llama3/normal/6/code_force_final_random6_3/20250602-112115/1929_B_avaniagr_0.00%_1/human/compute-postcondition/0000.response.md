According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object has at least 2 lines, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `open(0)` has at least 2 lines and `s` is now the second line.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 2 lines, `s` is the second line**
