Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be integers, which are obtained by splitting the second line `s` into two parts and converting them to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases, and `open(0)` has at least 1 line left. The value of `s` remains the same, which is the second line.
