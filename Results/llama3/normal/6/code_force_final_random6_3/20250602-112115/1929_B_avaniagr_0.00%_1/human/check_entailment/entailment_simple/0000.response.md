Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program uses a loop to iterate over each test case in the input. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k from the input, and then calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored using the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`.

The expression can be broken down into three parts:

1. `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored when k is less than 4n - 3. The expression `k // 2 + k % 2` calculates the ceiling of k/2, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover k diagonals. The expression `(k < 4 * n - 3)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if k is less than 4n - 3, and 0 otherwise. This ensures that this part of the expression only contributes to the result when k is less than 4n - 3.

2. `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored when k is greater than or equal to 4n - 3. In this case, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is 2n, because all diagonals need to be covered. The expression `(k >= 4 * n - 3)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if k is greater than or equal to 4n - 3, and 0 otherwise. This ensures that this part of the expression only contributes to the result when k is greater than or equal to 4n - 3.

3. `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part adds 1 to the result when k is equal to 4n - 2. This is because when k is equal to 4n - 2, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is 2n + 1, not 2n.

Overall, the expression correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case, and the program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
