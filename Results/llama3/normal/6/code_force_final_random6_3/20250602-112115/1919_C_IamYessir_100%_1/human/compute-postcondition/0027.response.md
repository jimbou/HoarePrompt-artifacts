Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list with one element which is the first element of `lit`, `x` is the first element of `lit`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains the first element of `lit`, and the value of `x` is updated to be the first element of `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
