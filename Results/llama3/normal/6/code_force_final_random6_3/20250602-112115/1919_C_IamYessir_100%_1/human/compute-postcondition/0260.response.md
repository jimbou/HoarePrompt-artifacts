Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, `x` is equal to `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `s` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `_` is still 2. The stdin now contains only one input: a space-separated list of integers. The list `a` is still non-empty, `i` is still 0, and `x` is now the last element of list `a` which is also equal to the last element of list `lit`. The list `b` is still non-empty, `y` is still the last element of list `b`, and `x` is still less than or equal to `y` and also equal to `y`.
