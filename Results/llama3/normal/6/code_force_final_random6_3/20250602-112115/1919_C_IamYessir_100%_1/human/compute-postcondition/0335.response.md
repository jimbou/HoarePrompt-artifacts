Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 3. Otherwise, `s` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
