Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit` and the first element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with one element which is the first element of `lit` and `y` is the first element of `lit`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of list `a`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. `x` is less than the first element of `lit`. The first element of `lit` is less than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `i`, and `cp` remain unchanged.***
