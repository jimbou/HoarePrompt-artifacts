Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, otherwise, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is now an integer greater than or equal to 3, otherwise, `s` is now an integer greater than or equal to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
