The code prints the value of `s`, which is the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first.

Output: **s (where s is the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive elements in a and b where the second element is greater than the first)**
