Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with one more element than before and `y` is the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of list `a` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is `lit[i]`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`.***
