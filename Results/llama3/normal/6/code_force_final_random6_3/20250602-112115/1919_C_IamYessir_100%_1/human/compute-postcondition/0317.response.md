Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of list `lit`, `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has changed to a non-empty list because an element from `lit` has been appended to it. As a result, the value of `x` is now the last element of list `lit`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
