Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. `x` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`***
