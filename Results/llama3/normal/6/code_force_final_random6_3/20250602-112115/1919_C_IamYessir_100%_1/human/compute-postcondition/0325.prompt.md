Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, i is 0, s is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 2, x is undefined, y is infinity, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, then either the last element of list `b` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if the element at index `i` in the list `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of list `a` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` and the element at index `i` in the list `lit` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` or if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `b` is a non-empty list with `y` as its last element. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, then either the last element of list `b` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if the element at index `i` in the list `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of list `a` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` and the element at index `i` in the list `lit` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` or if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `x` is `lit[i]` and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]`, then `x` is `lit[i]` and `y` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the i-th element of `lit`, then `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, and `y` is the last element of list `b` which is the i-th element of `lit`. Otherwise, if the i-th element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with one more element than before and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of list `a` and `x` is greater than or equal to the i-th element of `lit` and the i-th element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` is the last element of list `lit` and `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, `y` is updated to be the maximum of `y` and the elements of `lit` that are greater than `x`. If `x` is not less than `y`, then no update occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
