Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either the last element of `lit` or infinity if `b` is empty after appending the last element of `lit` to `b`. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is empty after appending the last element of `lit` to `b`, `y` is set to the last element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, and `x` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `b` now includes the last element of `lit` and the value of `y` is either the last element of `lit` or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty after appending the last element of `lit` to `b`.
