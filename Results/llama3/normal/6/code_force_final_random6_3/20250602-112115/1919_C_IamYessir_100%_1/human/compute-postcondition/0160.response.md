The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit[i]`. Additionally, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains one more integer than before which is `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `x`, `lit[i]`, and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` has an additional element which is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` contains the first element of `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, or `y` is equal to the first element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit` and the first element of `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of `a` is the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `y`.**
