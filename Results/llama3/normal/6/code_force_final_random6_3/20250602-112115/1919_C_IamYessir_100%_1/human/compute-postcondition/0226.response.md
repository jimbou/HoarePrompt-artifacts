To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `b` must still have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, stdin is empty. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
