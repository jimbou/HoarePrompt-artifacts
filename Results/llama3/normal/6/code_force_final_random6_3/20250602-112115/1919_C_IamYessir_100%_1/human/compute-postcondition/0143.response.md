Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty and has an additional element which is the first element of `lit`, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been updated by appending the first element of `lit` to it. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still valid, and the current value of `x` is still equal to the current value of `y`.
