Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is 1, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
