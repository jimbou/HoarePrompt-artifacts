Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. `y` is the value of `lit` at index `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1. The value of `i` remains 1. The list `lit` remains the same, equal to the second input from stdin. The value of `cp` remains 0. The list `a` remains the same, with at least one element, and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. The list `b` now has at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. The current value of `y` is the value of `lit` at index `i`.
