Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0.***
