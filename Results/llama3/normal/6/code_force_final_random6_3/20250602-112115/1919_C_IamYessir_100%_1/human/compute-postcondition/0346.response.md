Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a) + 2` or `len(a) + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a) + 1` or `len(a)`**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `s` are updated to reflect the increment.
