Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lit`, which is the second input from stdin. The value of `x` has also been updated to be the last element of `a`, which is now equal to `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
