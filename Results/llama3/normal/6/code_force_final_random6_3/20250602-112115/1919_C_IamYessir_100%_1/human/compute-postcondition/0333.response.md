Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.***
