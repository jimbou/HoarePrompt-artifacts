Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit`, then `b` contains one more element which is the third element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the third element of `lit`, then `b` contains one more element which is the last element of `lit`. If the third element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is updated by appending the last element of `lit` to `b`. If the third element of `lit` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, then the last element of `a` is updated to the element at index `i` of `lit` which is the element at index 2 of the second input from stdin.***
