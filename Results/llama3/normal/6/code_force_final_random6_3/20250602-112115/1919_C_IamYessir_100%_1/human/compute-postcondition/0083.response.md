Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. The list `b` now contains one more element which is the third element of list `lit` (because `i` is 2).**

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to be the last element of list `b`, which is the third element of list `lit` because `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
