Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity, `b` is not an empty list, and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer, `b` is not an empty list, and `y` is infinity.***
