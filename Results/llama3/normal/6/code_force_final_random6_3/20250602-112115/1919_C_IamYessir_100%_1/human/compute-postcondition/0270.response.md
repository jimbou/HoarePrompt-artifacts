Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `b` was previously an empty list, it is now a non-empty list. The value of `y` is now equal to the last element of list `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true, with the addition that `b` is now a non-empty list and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.
