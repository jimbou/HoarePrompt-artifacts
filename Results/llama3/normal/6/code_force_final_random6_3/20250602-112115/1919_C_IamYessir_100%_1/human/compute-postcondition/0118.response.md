The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0 and i is 0, so for the loop to execute, n must be greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `b` is an empty list, `y` is infinity, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty**
