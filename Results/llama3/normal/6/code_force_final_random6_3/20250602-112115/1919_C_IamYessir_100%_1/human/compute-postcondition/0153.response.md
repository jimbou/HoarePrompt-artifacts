Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer. `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`. The element at index `i` of `lit` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit` is greater than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is still 0, `s` is still 0, `_` is still 1, `a` is still a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is still an integer. `b` is now not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to the element at index `i` of `lit`. The element at index `i` of `lit` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit` is greater than `x`.
