Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity and `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. If `b` is not an empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of list `a`.***
