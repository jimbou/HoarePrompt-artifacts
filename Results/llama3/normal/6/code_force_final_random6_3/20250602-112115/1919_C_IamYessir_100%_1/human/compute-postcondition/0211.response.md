Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1, otherwise `s` remains 0.***
