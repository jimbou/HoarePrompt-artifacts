Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program then calculates the penalty for each subsequence by counting the number of pairs of consecutive elements where the second element is greater than the first element. The total penalty is the sum of the penalties for both subsequences.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when one of the subsequences is empty or when the input array has only one element. The use of `float('inf')` to represent infinity is also correct, as it allows the program to handle the case where one of the subsequences is empty.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, which is efficient for the given problem constraints. The program's space complexity is also O(n), as it needs to store the two subsequences.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
