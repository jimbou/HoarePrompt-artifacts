Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `lit` at index `i`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, `y` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `s`, `_`, `a`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `b` is no longer empty and now contains the element at index `i` of list `lit`. The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of list `lit` at index `i`. The relationship between `x` and `y` is maintained, with `x` being greater than `y`. The relationship between `y` and the element at index `i` in list `lit` is also maintained, with `y` being less than the element at index `i` in list `lit`. The relationship between `lit[i]` and `x` is maintained, with `lit[i]` being greater than `x`.
