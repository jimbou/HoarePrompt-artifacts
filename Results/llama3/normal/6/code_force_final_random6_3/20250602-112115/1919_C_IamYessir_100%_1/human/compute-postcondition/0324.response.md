Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the i-th element of `lit`, then `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, and `y` is the last element of list `b` which is the i-th element of `lit`. Otherwise, if the i-th element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with one more element than before and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of list `a` and `x` is greater than or equal to the i-th element of `lit` and the i-th element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` is the last element of list `lit` and `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, `y` is updated to be the maximum of `y` and the elements of `lit` that are greater than `x`. If `x` is not less than `y`, then no update occurs.***
