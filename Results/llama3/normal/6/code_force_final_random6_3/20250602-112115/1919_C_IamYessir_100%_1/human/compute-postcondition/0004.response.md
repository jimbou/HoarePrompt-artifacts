Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is infinity, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `x` is introduced with a value of infinity. The value of infinity is represented by `float('inf')` in Python. The rest of the variables retain their original values, and the stdin remains empty.
