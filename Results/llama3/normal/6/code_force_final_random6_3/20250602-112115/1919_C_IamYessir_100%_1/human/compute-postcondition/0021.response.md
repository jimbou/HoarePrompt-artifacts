Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `b` is either an empty list or a list with at least one element. If `b` is an empty list, then the current value of `y` is infinity and the current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. If `b` is not an empty list, then the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and the value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been updated by appending the value of `lit` at index `i`. The current value of `x` is now the value of `lit` at index `i`, which is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and greater than the current value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
