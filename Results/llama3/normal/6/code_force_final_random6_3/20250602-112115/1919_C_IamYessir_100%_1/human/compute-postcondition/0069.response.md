Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**

The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of list `a`, which was previously either the last element of `a` or infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
