Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 1, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
