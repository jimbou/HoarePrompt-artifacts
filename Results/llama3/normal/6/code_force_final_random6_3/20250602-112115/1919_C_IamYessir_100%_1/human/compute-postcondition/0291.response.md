Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list with `y` as its last element, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than `y`, then `x` is equal to `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is updated to be `lit[i]`, which is the last element of list `a`. The value of `y` remains the same, either infinity or the last element of list `b`. The list `a` is now non-empty with `lit[i]` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.
