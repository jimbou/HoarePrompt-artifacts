Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `y` is the last element of list `b`, `s` is either `len(a)` or `len(a) - 1`. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either `len(a)` or `len(a) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
