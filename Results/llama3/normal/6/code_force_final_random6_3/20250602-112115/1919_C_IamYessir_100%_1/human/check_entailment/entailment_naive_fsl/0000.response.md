Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into two subsequences s and t to minimize the penalty. The conditions for appending elements to a and b are not correctly implemented.

For example, when x > y, the program checks if y >= lit[i] and if so, appends lit[i] to b. However, this is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be to check if lit[i] <= y, and if so, append lit[i] to b. Similarly, when x < y, the program checks if x >= lit[i] and if so, appends lit[i] to a, but the correct condition should be to check if lit[i] <= x.

A counterexample is the input [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will split the array into s = [3, 4, 1, 5] and t = [1], but the optimal split is s = [3, 4, 5] and t = [1, 1], which has a lower penalty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
