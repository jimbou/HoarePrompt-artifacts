To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `b` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a)` or `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a) - 1` or `len(a) - 2`.**
