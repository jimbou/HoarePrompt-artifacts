Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b` with `x` less than `y`. In both cases, `x` is less than `y` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`.***
