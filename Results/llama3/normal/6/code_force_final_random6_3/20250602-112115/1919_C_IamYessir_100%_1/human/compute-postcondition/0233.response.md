To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and `int(input())`. Since `int(input())` is an expression that reads an integer from stdin, we can assume that it will read the next integer from stdin in the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, which means that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1.

The state of `int(input())` is not explicitly defined, but we know that it reads an integer from stdin. Since stdin is empty at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `int(input())` will read the next integer from stdin in the next iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `_` and did not change the state of any other variables, as they are not part of the loop head.
