Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, lit is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, cp is 0, a is an empty list, x is infinity, b is an empty list, y is infinity, s is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is now an integer greater than 0, as it was assigned the value returned by `int(input())`, which is greater than 0. The value of `i` is now 0, as it was assigned the length of `b`, which is an empty list. The value of `lit` remains the same, as it was assigned the list of integers from the second input from stdin. The value of `cp` remains 0, as it was not modified. The values of `a` and `b` are now empty lists, as they were reassigned to empty lists. The values of `x` and `y` are now infinity, as they were not modified and their previous values were either the last element of list `a` or infinity, and the last element of list `b` or infinity, respectively. The value of `s` is now 0, as it was not modified and its previous value was the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` and `b` where the second element is greater than the first, which is now 0 since `a` and `b` are empty lists. The value of `_` remains 1, as it was not modified. Stdin is now empty, as two inputs were read from it.
