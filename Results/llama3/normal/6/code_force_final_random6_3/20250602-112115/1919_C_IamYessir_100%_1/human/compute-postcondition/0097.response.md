Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, `s` is either 2 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be either 2 or 1, depending on its previous value. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` was initially 1 and is now 2. Otherwise, `s` was initially 0 and is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
