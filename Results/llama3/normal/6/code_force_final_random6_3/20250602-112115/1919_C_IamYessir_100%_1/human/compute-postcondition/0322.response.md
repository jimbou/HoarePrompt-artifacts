Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to be the maximum of `y` and the elements of `lit` that are greater than `x`. If `x` is not less than `y`, then no update occurs.***
