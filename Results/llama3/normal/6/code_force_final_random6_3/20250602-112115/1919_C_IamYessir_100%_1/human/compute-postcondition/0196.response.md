Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, `x` is the second element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**

The code appends the second element of `lit` to the list `a`. As a result, `a` now contains the second element of `lit`, and `x` is updated to be the second element of `lit`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
