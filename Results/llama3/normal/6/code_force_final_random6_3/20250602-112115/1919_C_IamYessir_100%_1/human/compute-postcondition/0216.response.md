Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, `s` is either 2 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is either 2 or 1 because it was incremented by 1 from its initial value, which was either 1 or 0 depending on whether `a[i]` was greater than `a[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
