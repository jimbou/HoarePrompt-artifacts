Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `b` is not empty and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` is not empty and `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `s`, `_` remains the same. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `lit` is still equal to the second input from stdin. The list `b` is no longer empty and its last element is `lit[i]` which is the second element of `lit`. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. The value of `a` and `x` remains the same.
