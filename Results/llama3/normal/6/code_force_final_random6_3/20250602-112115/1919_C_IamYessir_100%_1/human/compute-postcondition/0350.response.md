Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`. `s` is equal to the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first element, plus `len(a) - 1` if the first element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a`, or `len(a) - 2` otherwise, and the value of `s` is being printed**
