Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is the last element of `lit` which is the first element of `lit`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `a`, `x` and `lit` remains the same. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `b` is updated by appending the first element of `lit` to it, and the current value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `b` which is the first element of `lit`. The relation between `x` and `y` remains the same, i.e., `x` is greater than `y`.
