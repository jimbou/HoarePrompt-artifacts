The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, the last element of `a` is an integer. Therefore, the value of `x` is now an integer.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. The variable `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is still 0, `a` is still a list of integers that is not empty, `b` is still an empty list, `y` is still infinity, `s` is still 0, and `_` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer, `b` is an empty list, `y` is infinity, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty**
