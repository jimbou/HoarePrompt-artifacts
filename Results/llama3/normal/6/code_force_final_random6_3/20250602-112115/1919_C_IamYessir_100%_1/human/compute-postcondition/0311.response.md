Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]`, `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, else `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

The code appends the `i-th` element of `lit` to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially empty, it is now a non-empty list. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of list `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
