Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` is not empty and `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[1]`.***
