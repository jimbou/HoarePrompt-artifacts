The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list  b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list b.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, b has at least 2 elements, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, stdin is empty. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
