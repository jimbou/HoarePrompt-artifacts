Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is the last element of list `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `y` is infinity***
