Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`.***
