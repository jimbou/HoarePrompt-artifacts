Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `b` is not empty and `y` is the last element of `b` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`.***
