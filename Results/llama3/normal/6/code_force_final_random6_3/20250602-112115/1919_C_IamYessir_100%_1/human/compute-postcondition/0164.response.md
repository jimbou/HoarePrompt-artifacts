Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` is not empty and `x` is infinity, and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to infinity, regardless of whether `a` is empty or not. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
