The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a and variable i. If i is less than the length of list a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time the i is 2 and a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
