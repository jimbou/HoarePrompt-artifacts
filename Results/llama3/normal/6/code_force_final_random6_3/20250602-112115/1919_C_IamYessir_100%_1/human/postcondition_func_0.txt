This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list of integers, splitting it into two lists a and b based on certain conditions. The function counts the number of pairs of consecutive elements in both lists where the second element is greater than the first element and prints this count. The function repeats this process for each test case.
