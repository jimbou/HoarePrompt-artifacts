Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `b` is a list of integers that contains at least one element which is the i-th element of `lit`, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `y` is the last element of list `b` which is the i-th element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include at least one element, which is the i-th element of `lit`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be the last element of list `b`, which is the i-th element of `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
