Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with `x` as its last element, `b` is a non-empty list with `y` as its last element, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to be the last element of list `b`, which is a non-empty list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions on the lists `a` and `b` are also preserved, with `a` being either empty or non-empty with `x` as its last element, and `b` being non-empty with `y` as its last element.
