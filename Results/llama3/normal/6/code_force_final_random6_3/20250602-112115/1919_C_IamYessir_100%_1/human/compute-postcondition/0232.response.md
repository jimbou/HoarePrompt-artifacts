Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty. If `b` is a non-decreasing list, then `s` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `s` is being printed**
