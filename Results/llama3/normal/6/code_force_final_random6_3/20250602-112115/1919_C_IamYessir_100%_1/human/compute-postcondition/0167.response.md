Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `b` is not empty and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` is not empty and `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lit`, which is the second input from stdin. As a result, `b` is no longer empty, and `y` is now equal to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
