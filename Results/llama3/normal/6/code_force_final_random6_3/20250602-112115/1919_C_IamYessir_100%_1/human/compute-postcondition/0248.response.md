Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be a non-empty list by appending the value of `lit[i]`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be the last element of list `b`, which is equal to `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
