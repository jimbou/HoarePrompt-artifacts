Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is the last element of `lit` which is the first element of `lit`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is not empty, then `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `a` is empty, then the current value of `x` is infinity. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.***
