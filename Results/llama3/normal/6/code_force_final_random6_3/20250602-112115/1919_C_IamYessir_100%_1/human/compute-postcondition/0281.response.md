Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `b` is a non-empty list with `y` as its last element. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, then either the last element of list `b` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if the element at index `i` in the list `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of list `a` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` and the element at index `i` in the list `lit` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` or if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.***
