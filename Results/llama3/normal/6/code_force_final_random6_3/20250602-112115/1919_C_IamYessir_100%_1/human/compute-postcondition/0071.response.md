Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is infinity. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is now infinity, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
