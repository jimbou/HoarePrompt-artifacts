Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]` , `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the value of `lit[i]` to it. The value of `x` is now the last element of list `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
