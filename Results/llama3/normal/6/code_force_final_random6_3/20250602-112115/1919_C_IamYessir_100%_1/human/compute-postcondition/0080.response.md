Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and `a` has an additional element which is the third element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, but the list `a` has been modified by appending the third element of the list `lit` to it. The value of `x` is now the last element of the updated list `a`.
