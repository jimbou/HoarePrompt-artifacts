Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `b` is a list with at least one element, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of list `b`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a` and `x` are still valid, and the stdin remains empty.
