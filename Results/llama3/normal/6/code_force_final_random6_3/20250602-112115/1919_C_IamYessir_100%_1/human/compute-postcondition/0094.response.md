Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, `s` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]` still holds true.
