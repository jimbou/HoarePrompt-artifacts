Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a` is not empty, then `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, and `y` is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[1]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is `lit[i]`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`. `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `lit` is still a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is still 0, `s` is still 0, and `_` is still 1. The list `a` is no longer empty and its last element is `lit[i]`, which is also the value of `x`. The value of `y` is still the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise it is infinity. The conditions for updating `x` and `y` based on their comparison with `lit[i]` are still the same.
