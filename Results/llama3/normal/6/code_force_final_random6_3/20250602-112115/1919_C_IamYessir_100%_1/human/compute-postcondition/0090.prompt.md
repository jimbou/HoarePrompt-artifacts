Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, lit is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is not empty, then `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `a` is empty, then the current value of `x` is infinity. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list with one element which is the first element of `lit`, `x` is the first element of `lit`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than the first element of `lit`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `b` is an empty list, then the current value of `y` is infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i` and `y` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list with one element which is the first element of `lit`, `x` is the first element of `lit`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than the first element of `lit`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit`, then `b` contains one more element which is the third element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the third element of `lit`, then `b` contains one more element which is the last element of `lit`. If the third element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is updated by appending the last element of `lit` to `b`. If the third element of `lit` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, then the last element of `a` is updated to the element at index `i` of `lit` which is the element at index 2 of the second input from stdin. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` has an additional element which is the third element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, the last element of `a` is now the element at index `i` of `lit` which is the element at index 2 of the second input from stdin. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then the list `b` contains one more element which is the third element of list `lit`. If `x` is not less than `y` and not equal to `y`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
