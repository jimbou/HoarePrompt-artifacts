Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop (`n`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` is now equal to the length of list `b`. The list `b` is the same as in the initial state, but its length is now known to be equal to `i`. The variable `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether `b` is empty or not. The variable `s` is the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first.
