Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 2 or the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is either the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1 or the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
