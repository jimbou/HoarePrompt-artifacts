Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `b` is a list of integers with one element which is the first element of `lit`. The current value of `y` is the first element of `lit`. If `a` is an empty list, then the current value of `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. `x` is less than the first element of `lit`. The first element of `lit` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the current element of `lit` at index `i` and the current element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the first element of `lit`, and the value of `y` has been updated to be the first element of `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
