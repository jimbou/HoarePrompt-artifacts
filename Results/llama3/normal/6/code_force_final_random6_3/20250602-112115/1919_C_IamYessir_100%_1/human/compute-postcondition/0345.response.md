The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and the length of the list b. If i is less than the length of the list b, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, b is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be 3 and b must be a non-empty list with at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either `len(a) + 1` or `len(a)`. Otherwise, `s` is either `len(a)` or `len(a) - 1`.**
