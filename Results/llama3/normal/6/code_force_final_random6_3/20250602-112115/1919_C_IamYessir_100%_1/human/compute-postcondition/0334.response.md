To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `a` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**
