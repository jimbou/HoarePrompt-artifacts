Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `s` is either the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 2 or the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` now depends on whether it was initially the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1 or the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first.
