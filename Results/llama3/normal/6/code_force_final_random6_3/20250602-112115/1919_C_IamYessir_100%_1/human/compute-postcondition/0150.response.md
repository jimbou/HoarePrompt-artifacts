Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty and its last element is `lit[i]`, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is still 0, `s` is still 0, `_` is still 1. The list `a` is still not empty and its last element is now `lit[i]`. The value of `x` is still an integer. The value of `y` is still either infinity (if `b` is an empty list) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty). The relationships between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` are still maintained, i.e., `x` is less than `y` and `x` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.
