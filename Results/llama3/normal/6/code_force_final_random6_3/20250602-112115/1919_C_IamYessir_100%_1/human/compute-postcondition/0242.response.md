The code `y = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `y`. The previous value of `y` was already infinity, so this assignment does not change the value of `y`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is infinity.**
