To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, stdin is empty**
