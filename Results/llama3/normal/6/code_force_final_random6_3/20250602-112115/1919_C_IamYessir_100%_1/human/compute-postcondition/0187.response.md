Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a` is empty, then `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to infinity, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are still valid, but since `y` is now infinity, the conditions that depend on the comparison between `x` and `y` will be affected. Specifically, if `x` is greater than `y` (which is now infinity), the conditions that update `y` to `lit[i]` or `x` to `lit[i]` will not be triggered. Similarly, if `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the conditions that update `x` to the minimum of `x` and `lit[i]` or `y` to `lit[i]` will not be triggered.
