Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first.***
