Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty.**

The code only changes the value of `s` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` was already 0 in the initial state, so the output state is the same as the initial state.
