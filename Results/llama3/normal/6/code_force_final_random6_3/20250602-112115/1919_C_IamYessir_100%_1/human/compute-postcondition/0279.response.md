Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `x` is infinity, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to infinity. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions that were true in the initial state are still true in the output state, including the relationships between `x`, `y`, and the elements of `lit`.
