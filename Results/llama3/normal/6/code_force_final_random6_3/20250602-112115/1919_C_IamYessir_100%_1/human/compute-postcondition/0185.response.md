Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, `a` is not empty, `b` is either empty or not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the last element of `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are still valid, but the value of `x` has been specifically assigned to the last element of `a`.
