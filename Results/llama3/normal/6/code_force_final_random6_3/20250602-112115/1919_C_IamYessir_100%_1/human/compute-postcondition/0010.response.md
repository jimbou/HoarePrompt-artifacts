Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `b` is a list with at least one element, `cp` is 0, stdin is empty. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of list `a`.***
