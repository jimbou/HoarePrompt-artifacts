Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is not empty, then `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is infinity. If `a` is empty, then the current value of `x` is infinity. If `b` is an empty list, then the current value of `y` is infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to infinity, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the values of `x` and `y` in the initial state are still valid, but now `x` is always infinity.
