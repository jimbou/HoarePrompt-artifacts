Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, stdin is empty. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, stdin is empty. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, stdin is empty. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
