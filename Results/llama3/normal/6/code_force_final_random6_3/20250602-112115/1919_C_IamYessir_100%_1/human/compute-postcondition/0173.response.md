Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` of `lit` to it. As a result, `x` is now equal to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
