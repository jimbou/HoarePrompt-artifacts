Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to the i-th element of `lit`, then `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, and `y` is the last element of list `b` which is the i-th element of `lit`. Otherwise, if the i-th element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with one more element than before and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of list `a` and `x` is greater than or equal to the i-th element of `lit` and the i-th element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, then `y` is the last element of list `b`.***
