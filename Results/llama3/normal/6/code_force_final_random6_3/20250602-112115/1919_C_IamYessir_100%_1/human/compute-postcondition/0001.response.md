The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin: the first line is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, and the second line is split into a list of integers and assigned to `lit`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `cp` are initialized as empty lists and an integer with value 0, respectively.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is an integer with a value equal to the first input from stdin.
* `lit` is a list of integers with values equal to the second input from stdin, split into individual integers.
* `a` and `b` are empty lists.
* `cp` is an integer with a value of 0.

The input from stdin is consumed by the two `input()` calls, so stdin is now empty.

Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, lit is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin is empty**
