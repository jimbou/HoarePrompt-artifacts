Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty and contains one more integer than before which is `lit[i]`, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `s`, `_` remains the same. The list `a` now contains one more integer which is the first element of `lit`. The value of `i`, `x`, `lit`, `y`, `b` remains the same.
