Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1 if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is now the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
