Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is the last element of list `b`, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of list `b`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` remains the same, with two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
