Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, the last element of `a` is now the element at index `i` of `lit` which is the element at index 2 of the second input from stdin. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then the list `b` contains one more element which is the third element of list `lit`.***
