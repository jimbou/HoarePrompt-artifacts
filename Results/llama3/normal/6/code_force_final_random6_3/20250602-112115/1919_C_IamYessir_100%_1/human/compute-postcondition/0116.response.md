The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the value returned by `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` must be 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, and the value of `s` is being printed, `_` is 1, the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0**
