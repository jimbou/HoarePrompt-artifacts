Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `x` is infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b`, `b` is either an empty list or a list containing the second element of `lit`, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing elements.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to infinity, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are no longer applicable since `x` is now infinity. The values of `b` and `a` are still dependent on their previous conditions, but their exact values are not affected by the update of `x`.
