Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, then the current value of `y` is infinity and the current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. If `b` is not an empty list, then the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then the current value of `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to `x`.***
