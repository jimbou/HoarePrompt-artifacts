Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to infinity, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The lists `a` and `b` still have the same properties as before, and the variables `n`, `i`, `lit`, and `cp` retain their initial values.
