The code `x = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `x`. The initial state already had `x` as infinity, so this assignment does not change the value of `x`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `b` is an empty list, `y` is infinity, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty.**
