Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty and contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `s`, `_` remains the same. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `lit` remains the same list of integers equal to the second input from stdin. The value of `a` is updated to include the first element of `lit`. The value of `x` remains the same integer. The value of `y` remains the same, either infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if it's not empty. The relationship between `x` and `y` remains the same, with `x` being less than `y`. The relationship between `x` and the first element of `lit` remains the same, with `x` being greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`.
