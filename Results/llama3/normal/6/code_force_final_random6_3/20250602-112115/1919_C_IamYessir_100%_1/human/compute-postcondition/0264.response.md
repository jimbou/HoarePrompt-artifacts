Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list and its last element is the current value of `lit[i]`, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a` which is equal to `lit[i]`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the current value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. As a result, the last element of `a` is now equal to `lit[i]`, and `x` is also equal to `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
