Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `b` is an empty list, then the current value of `y` is infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, and `cp` is still 0. The list `a` now has at least one element, and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `y` is still either infinity (if `b` is an empty list) or the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not an empty list). Additionally, `x` is still less than `y`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is still greater than `y`.
