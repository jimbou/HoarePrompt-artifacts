Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.***
