Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `b` is a non-empty list with `y` as its last element. If `a` is a non-empty list, then `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b` and `y` is infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to infinity, regardless of the previous state of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the lists `a` and `b` and the variables `x` and `y` are still valid, but the value of `y` is now specifically set to infinity.
