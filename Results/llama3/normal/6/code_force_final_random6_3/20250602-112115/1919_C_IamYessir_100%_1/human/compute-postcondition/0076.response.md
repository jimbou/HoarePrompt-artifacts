Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and the last element of `a` is now the element at index `i` of `lit` which is the element at index 2 of the second input from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `lit` is still a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, and `cp` is still 0. The list `a` now has an additional element which is the element at index 2 of the second input from stdin, and the current value of `x` is this new last element of `a`. The list `b` and the value of `y` remain unchanged.
