Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`.**
