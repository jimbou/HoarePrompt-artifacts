The code assigns the value of the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. The value of the last element of list `a` is not specified, so the value of `x` is also not specified. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`, stdin is empty**
