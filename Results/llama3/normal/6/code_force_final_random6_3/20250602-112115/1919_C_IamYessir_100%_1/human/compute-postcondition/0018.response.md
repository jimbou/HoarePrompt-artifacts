Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `b` is a list with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is the last element of list `b`, which is the value of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is not empty, then `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `a` is empty, then the current value of `x` is infinity. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers from the second input, and `cp` is still 0. The list `b` now has at least one element, and its last element is the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `x` remains the same, either the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty, or infinity if `a` is empty. The relationships between `x`, `y`, and the value of `lit` at index `i` are maintained.
