Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains one more integer than before which is `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `x`, `lit[i]`, and `y` remain unchanged. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`.***
