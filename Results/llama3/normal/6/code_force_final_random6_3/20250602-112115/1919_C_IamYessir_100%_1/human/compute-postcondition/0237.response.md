Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `x` is infinity, `y` is infinity, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to infinity, which is the same as the value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
