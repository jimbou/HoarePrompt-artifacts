Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lit`, and the value of `x` has been updated to be the value of `lit` at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
