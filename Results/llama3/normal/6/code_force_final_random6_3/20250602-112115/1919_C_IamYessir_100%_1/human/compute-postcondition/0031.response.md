Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is the last element of list `b`. `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated by appending the first element of `lit` to it, and the current value of `x` is now the first element of `lit`. The values of `n`, `i`, `cp`, `b`, and `y` remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` and the relationship between `x` and the first element of `lit` are still valid.
