Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` was either 2 or 1, and now it is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `s` was 0, and now it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
