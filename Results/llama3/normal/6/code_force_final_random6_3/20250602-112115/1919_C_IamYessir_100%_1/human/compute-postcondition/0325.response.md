Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of list `b`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is equal to the last element of list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit`. If `y` is less than the last element of list `lit`, then either the last element of list `b` is the last element of list `lit` if the last element of list `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of list `a` is the last element of list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit` and the last element of list `lit` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is equal to the last element of list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit` or if the last element of list `lit` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit` and the last element of list `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the last element of list `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`.
- The list `a` is non-empty, and its last element is stored in the variable `x`.
- If the list `b` is empty, then the variable `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is non-empty, and its last element is stored in the variable `y`.
- The value of `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
- If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is equal to the last element of list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit`. If `y` is less than the last element of list `lit`, then either the last element of list `b` is the last element of list `lit` if the last element of list `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of list `a` is the last element of list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit` and the last element of list `lit` is greater than the current value of `y`.
- If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is equal to the last element of list `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit` or if the last element of list `lit` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of list `lit` and the last element of list `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the last element of list `lit`.
