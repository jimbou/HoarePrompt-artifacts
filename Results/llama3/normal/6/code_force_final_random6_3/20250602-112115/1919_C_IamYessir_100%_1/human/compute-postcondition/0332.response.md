Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element of list `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of list `b`, `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 2, otherwise `s` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
