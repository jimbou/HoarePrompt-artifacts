Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `lit[i-1]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list with at least one element, where the last element of `b` is the value of `lit` at index `i-1` and `y` is the value of `lit` at index `i-1`. If `lit[i-1]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i-1]` and `lit[i-1]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i-1`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list with one element which is the first element of `lit`, `x` is the first element of `lit`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the element of `lit` at index `i-1`. If `x` is less than the first element of `lit`, then if `lit[i-1]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the current value of `x` is the last element of list `a` which is `lit[i-1]`. `s` is 0.**

The code `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. The initial state remains the same, with the addition of `s` being 0.
