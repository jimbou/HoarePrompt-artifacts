To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1. Also, `a` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, `s` is 0**
