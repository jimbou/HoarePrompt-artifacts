Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, stdin is empty. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
