Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`.**
