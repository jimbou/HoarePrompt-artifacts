Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0. `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the current value of `x` is the value of `lit` at index `i`. `b` is a list of integers and the current value of `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**

The code appends the value of `lit` at index `i` to the list `a`. Since `a` already had at least one element, it now has at least two elements. The current value of `x` is updated to be the value of `lit` at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
