Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list with `y` as its last element, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `x` is `lit[i]` and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than `y`, then `x` is `lit[i]` and `y` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `s` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `_` is still 2. The list `a` is now non-empty with `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is now equal to `lit[i]`. The list `b` is still non-empty with `y` as its last element, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. The stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. The relationship between `x` and `y` has changed: if `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `x` is `lit[i]` and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than `y`, then `x` is `lit[i]` and `y` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`.
