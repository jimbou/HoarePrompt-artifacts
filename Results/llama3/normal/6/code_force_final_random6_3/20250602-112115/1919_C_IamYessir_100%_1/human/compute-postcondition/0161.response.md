Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b`, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been changed to infinity. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are no longer applicable since `x` is now infinity. The list `b` and the value of `y` are still dependent on the initial conditions.
