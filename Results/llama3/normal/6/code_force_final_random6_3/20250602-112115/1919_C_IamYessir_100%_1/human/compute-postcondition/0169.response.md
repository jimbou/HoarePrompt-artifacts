Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` is not empty and `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a`. `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a` which is equal to `lit[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element at index `i` (which is 1) from the list `lit`. As a result, `a` is no longer empty, and `x` is now equal to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
