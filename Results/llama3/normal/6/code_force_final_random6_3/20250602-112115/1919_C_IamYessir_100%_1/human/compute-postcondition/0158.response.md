Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` has an additional element which is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` contains the first element of `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, or `y` is equal to the first element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit` and the first element of `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of `a` is the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `y`.***
