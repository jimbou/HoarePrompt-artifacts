Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `y` is infinity, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to infinity, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still dependent on the list `a`, which is not affected by the code.
