To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b)`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or infinity, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first**
