Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is infinity.***
