Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer, `b` is not an empty list, and `y` is the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of the list `b`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is not empty, and `x` is an integer. The list `b` is also not empty, and its last element is now assigned to `y`.
