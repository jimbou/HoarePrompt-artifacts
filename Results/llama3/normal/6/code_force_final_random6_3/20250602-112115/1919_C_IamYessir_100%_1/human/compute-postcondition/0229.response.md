Output State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, stdin is empty. `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `b` has at least two elements, then `s` is equal to the number of elements in `b` that are greater than their previous element.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` is now equal to the length of `b`, and the variable `s` is equal to the number of elements in `b` that are greater than their previous element. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
