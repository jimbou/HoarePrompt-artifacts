Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer. `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit[i]`. Additionally, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has changed from an empty list to a list containing the element `lit[i]`. As a result, `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
