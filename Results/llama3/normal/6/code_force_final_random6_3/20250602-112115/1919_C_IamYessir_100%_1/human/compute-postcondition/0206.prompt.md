Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, lit is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, cp is 0, a is an empty list, x is infinity, b is an empty list, y is infinity, s is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is an integer. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit[i]`. Additionally, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains one more integer than before which is `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `x`, `lit[i]`, and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` has an additional element which is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` contains the first element of `lit` if `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, or `y` is equal to the first element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit` and the first element of `lit` is greater than `x`, or the last element of `a` is the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` is not empty and `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, and `y` is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is equal to `lit[1]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is `lit[i]`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a` is empty, then `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, and `y` is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then either `x` is equal to `lit[1]` or `a` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is `lit[i]`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is not empty and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
