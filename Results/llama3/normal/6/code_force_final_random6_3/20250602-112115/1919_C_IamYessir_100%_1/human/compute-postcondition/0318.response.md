Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of the list `lit`. As a result, `b` is now a non-empty list, and its last element is `lit[i]`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be equal to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
