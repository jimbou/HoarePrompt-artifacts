Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining whether a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The given program, however, only checks if the width 'b' is even or odd.

The program's logic is incorrect because it does not consider the actual problem requirements. It simply checks the parity of 'b' and returns 'yes' if it's even and 'no' if it's odd. This does not accurately determine whether a different rectangle can be formed.

For example, the program would return 'yes' for the input (2, 6), which is correct, but it would also return 'yes' for the input (2, 4), which is incorrect because the resulting rectangles would be the same.

Correctness: **False**
