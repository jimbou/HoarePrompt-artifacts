Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if the value of `b` is even or odd, but it does not consider the value of `a`. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This means that the program should check if either `a` or `b` can be divided into two equal parts, not just `b`.

For example, the input `3 2` should return "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two `3 x 1` rectangles, and then these two rectangles can be used to form the `1 x 6` rectangle, which is different from the `3 x 2` rectangle. However, the provided program will return "No" for this input because `b` is not even.

Correctness: **False**
