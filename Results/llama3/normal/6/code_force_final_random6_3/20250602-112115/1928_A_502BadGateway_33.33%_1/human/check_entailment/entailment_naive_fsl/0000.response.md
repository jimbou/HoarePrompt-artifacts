Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 3`, the program will output "no", but it is actually possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two 2x3 rectangles and then forming a 3x4 rectangle.

A correct solution would need to check both `a` and `b` for divisibility by 2, and also consider the case where the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of different sizes.
