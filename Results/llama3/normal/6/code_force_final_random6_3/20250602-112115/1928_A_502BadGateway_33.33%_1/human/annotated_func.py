#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns either 'yes' if b is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), or 'no' if b is an odd integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given integer b is even or odd, returning 'yes' for even numbers and 'no' for odd numbers, within the range of 1 to 10^9 (inclusive).
