Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if a given rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function returns `'yes'` if `b` is even and `'no'` if `b` is odd.

However, this solution is incomplete and incorrect. The problem statement does not only depend on the parity of `b`, but also on the relationship between `a` and `b`. For example, if `a` and `b` are both even, it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

A correct solution would need to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, as well as the parity of `a` and `b`. If the GCD of `a` and `b` is greater than 1, it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the correct solution would require a more complex approach.

Correctness: **False**
