This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates a value based on the second integer in each pair, and then adjusts this value based on the first integer in the pair if necessary. It prints the final calculated value for each pair. The function processes a number of pairs specified by an initial integer read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty after processing.
