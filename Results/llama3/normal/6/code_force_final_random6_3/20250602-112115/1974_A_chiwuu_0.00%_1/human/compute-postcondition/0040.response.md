Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated based on the initial state of `t`. If `t` is divisible by 5, it remains unchanged, and `t1` is calculated as `15 * t - 4 * b`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `b // 5 + 1`, and `t1` is calculated as `11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b`. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
