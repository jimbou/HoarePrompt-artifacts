The value of `t` is updated to be `t // 5`, where `t` is initially equal to `2*b`. Since `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is initially between 0 and 198. After the update, `t` is between 0 and 39 (inclusive), since `t // 5` performs integer division and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer between 0 and 39 (inclusive), stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
