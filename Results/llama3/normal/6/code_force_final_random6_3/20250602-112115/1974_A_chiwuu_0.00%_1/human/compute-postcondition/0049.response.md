Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin is empty, i is equal to n, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, and t is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b, 15 * t - 4 * b, t + (a - (11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15, or t + (a - (15 * t - 4 * b)) // 15 + 1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), the standard input will be empty, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`, and the variables `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t` will have values that depend on the previous iterations of the loop. The value of `t1` will be either `11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b` or `15 * t - 4 * b`, and the value of `t` will be either `11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b`, `15 * t - 4 * b`, `t + (a - (11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15`, or `t + (a - (15 * t - 4 * b)) // 15 + 1`, depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `t` in the previous iterations.
