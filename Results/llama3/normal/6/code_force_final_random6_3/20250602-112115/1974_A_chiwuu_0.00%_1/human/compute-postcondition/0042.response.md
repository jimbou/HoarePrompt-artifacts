Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, `t2` is `a` minus `t1`, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t2` is calculated as the difference between `a` and `t1`, where `t1` can be either of two expressions depending on the value of `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The input in stdin remains the same, containing n-3 lines with two space-separated integers each.
