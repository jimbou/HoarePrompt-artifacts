The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). 

The value of `n` is assigned the value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99).**
