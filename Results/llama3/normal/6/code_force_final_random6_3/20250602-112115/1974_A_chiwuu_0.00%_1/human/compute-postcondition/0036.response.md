Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t is 2*b, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The code reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` is then calculated as `b * 2`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains `n-3` lines, each with two space-separated integers.
