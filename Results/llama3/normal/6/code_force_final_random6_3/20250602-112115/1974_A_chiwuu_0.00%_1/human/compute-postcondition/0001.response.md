The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99), `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 0**
