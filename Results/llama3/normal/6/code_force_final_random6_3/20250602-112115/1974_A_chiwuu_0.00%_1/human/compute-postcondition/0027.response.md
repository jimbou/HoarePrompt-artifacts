Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4 or 2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4, `t` is equal to `t1`, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that a new variable `t` has been introduced, which is equal to the value of `t1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-2 lines of input.
