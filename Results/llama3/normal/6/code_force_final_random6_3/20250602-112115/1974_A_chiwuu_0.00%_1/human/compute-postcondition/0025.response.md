Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is a multiple of 5, then t is set to 2*b//5. Otherwise, t is set to 2*b//5 + 1.***
