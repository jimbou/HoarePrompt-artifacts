The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4 or 2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is equal to `t1`. Otherwise, `t2` is either `a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)` or `a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)`, and `t` is either `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` or `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15, otherwise `t` is either `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1` or `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`. Stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), and the value of t is printed**
