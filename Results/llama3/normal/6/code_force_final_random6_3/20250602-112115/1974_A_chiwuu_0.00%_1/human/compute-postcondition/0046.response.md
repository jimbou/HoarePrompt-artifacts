Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b. Otherwise, `t2` is `a` minus `t1`, and if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t` plus `t2 // 15 + 1`.**
