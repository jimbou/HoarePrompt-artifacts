Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is `b // 5 + 1`, stdin contains `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to `b // 5 + 1`, which is a new expression based on the value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n-3` lines of input.
