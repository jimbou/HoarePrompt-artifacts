Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells), dividing by 5 (since each screen has 5 rows), and rounding up to the nearest integer (since we can't have a fraction of a screen).

2. It then calculates the remaining space on these screens that can be occupied by 1x1 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and subtracting the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons).

3. If the remaining space is sufficient to accommodate all the 1x1 icons, then the total number of screens needed is the same as the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

4. If the remaining space is not sufficient, then additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of additional screens needed is calculated by dividing the remaining number of 1x1 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and rounding up to the nearest integer.

5. The total number of screens needed is then the sum of the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
