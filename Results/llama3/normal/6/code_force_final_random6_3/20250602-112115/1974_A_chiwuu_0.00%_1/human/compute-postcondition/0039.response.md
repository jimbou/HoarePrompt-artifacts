Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is divisible by 5, t remains unchanged. Otherwise, t is set to b // 5 + 1.***
