Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, `t2` is `a` minus `t1`, `t` is `t` plus `t2 // 15 + 1`, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been updated by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to it, where `t2` is the difference between `a` and `t1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t1` remain the same. The input in stdin remains the same, with n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y.
