Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4 or 2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4, `t2` is either a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4) or a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4), `t` is either t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1 or t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 and then adding 1. The stdin still contains n-2 lines, each with two space-separated integers x and y.
