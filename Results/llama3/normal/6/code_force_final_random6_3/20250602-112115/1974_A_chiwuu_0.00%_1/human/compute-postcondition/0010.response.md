Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is equal to `t`, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is divisible by 5, `t1` is an integer between -3*b+15*0 and -3*b+15*39 (inclusive), otherwise `t1` is an integer equal to (2*b*15)//5+15-4*b = 6*b-4*b+15 = 2*b+15 and is not divisible by 5. The current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the given code does not change any variable values. The variable `t` is assigned its current value, which does not affect any other variables. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
