Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to 2*b//5 + 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The value of `t` is updated to be equal to 2*b//5 + 1, where `b` is an integer between 0 and 99. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
