Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer, if `t` is divisible by 5, `t1` is an integer between -3*b+15*0 and -3*b+15*39 (inclusive), otherwise `t1` is an integer equal to (2*b*15)//5+15-4*b = 6*b-4*b+15 = 2*b+15 and is not divisible by 5. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the current value of `t1` is maintained. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is an integer equal to `a` - `t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1, and the value of `t` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4 or 2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is equal to `t1`. Otherwise, `t2` is either `a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)` or `a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)`, and `t` is either `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` or `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15, otherwise `t` is either `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1` or `t + (a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`. Stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), and the value of t is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b. Otherwise, `t2` is `a` minus `t1`, and if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t` plus `t2 // 15 + 1`, and the value of `t` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
