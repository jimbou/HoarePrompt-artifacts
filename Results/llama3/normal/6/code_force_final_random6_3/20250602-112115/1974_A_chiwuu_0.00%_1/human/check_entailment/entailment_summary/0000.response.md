Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers (a and b) representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. Since each screen has 15 cells (5x3), it calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons by dividing the total number of cells needed for the 2x2 icons (b*4) by 15 and rounding up to the nearest integer.

4. It then calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. If there are enough remaining cells to place all the 1x1 icons, it doesn't need to allocate any additional screens.

5. If there are not enough remaining cells to place all the 1x1 icons, it calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by dividing the number of remaining 1x1 icons by 15 and rounding up to the nearest integer.

6. Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed, which is the sum of the screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
