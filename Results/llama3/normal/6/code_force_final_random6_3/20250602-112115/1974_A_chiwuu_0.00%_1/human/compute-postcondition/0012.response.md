Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is divisible by 5, `t1` is an integer between -3*b+15*0 and -3*b+15*39 (inclusive), otherwise `t1` is an integer equal to (2*b*15)//5+15-4*b = 6*b-4*b+15 = 2*b+15 and is not divisible by 5. `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is an integer equal to `a` - `t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t2` is calculated as the difference between `a` and `t1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t1` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains n-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers x and y.
