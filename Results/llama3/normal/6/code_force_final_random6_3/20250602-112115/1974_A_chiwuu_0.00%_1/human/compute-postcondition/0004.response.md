The code `t = t // 5` divides the current value of `t` by 5 and assigns the result back to `t`. Since `t` is initially a multiple of 5, the result of the division will be an integer.

The initial value of `t` is 2 times `b`, where `b` is an integer between 0 and 99. Therefore, the initial value of `t` is between 0 and 198 (inclusive).

After dividing `t` by 5, the new value of `t` will be between 0 and 39 (inclusive), since 198 divided by 5 is 39.6, but the result is truncated to an integer.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer between 0 and 39 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**
