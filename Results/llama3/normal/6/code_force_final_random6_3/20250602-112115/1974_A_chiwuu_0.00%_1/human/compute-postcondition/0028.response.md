Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4 or 2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4, `t2` is either a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4) or a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4), stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated based on the value of `t1`, which is either 2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4 or 2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4. The value of `t2` is then either a - (2*b//5 * 15 - b * 4) or a - (2*b//5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4). The other variables remain unchanged.
