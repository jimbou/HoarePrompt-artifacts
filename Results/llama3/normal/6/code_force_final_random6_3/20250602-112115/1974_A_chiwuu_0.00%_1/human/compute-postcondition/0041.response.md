Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, `t` is either 11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b or 15 * t - 4 * b, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`, it simply assigns the current value of `t` back to itself. Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same, which is either `11 * (b // 5 + 1) - 4 * b` or `15 * t - 4 * b`. The other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
