Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), i is 0, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99. If t is divisible by 5, t is an integer between 0 and 39 (inclusive). Otherwise, t is an integer equal to (2 times b) // 5 + 1 and is not divisible by 5.***
