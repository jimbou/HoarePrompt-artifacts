Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `c` * `a` + `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`, `i` is 1, stdin contains no more test cases, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**

The value of `s` has been updated to include the additional terms `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` and `c` * `a`. Since `m` is 0, the term `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` is also 0. Therefore, the value of `s` is now `c` * `a` + `c` * `a`, which simplifies to `2` * `c` * `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
