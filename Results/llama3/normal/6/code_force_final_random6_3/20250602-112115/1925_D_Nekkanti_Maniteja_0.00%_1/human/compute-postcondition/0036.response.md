State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a + ... (k times), a is the original value of a plus the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k, stdin contains at least one more test case**
