Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5. a_i and b_i are integers between 1 and n, and f_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `k` * `c` * `a` + (`k` - 1) * `k` / 2 * `c` * `i` * `c` * `m`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`, `i` is `k` - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a + ... (k times), a is the original value of a plus the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, and the value of s modulo M is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `a` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k - 1`, stdin contains at least one more test case, and 0 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
