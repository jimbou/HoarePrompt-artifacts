Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k, stdin contains at least one more test case**

The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. The variables `s` and `a` are initialized to 0. The values of `u`, `v`, `f`, and `i` are not modified by the code. The input is consumed by the first line, leaving at least one more test case in the input.
