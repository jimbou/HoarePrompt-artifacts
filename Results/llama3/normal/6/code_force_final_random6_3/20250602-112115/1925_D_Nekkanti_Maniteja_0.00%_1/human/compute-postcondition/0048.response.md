Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is 2 * `c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `a` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one more test case**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include an additional term of `c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is added to its original value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one more test case.
