Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f plus f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input.**

The code snippet reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f`, respectively. After that, it increments `a` by the value of `f`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
