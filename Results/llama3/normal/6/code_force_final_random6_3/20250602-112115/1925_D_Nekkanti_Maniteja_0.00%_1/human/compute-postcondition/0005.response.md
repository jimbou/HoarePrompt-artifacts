Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus 2 * f, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f, respectively. Then, it increments the value of a by f. The value of a is now the original value of a plus 2 * f. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin is updated to contain at least 1 test case minus two.
