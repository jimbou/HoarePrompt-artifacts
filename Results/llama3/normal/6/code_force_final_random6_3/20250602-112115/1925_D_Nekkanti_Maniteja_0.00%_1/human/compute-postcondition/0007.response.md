Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus 3 * f, i is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus three, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is incremented by `f`, which is the third input from stdin. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned the first, second, and third inputs from stdin, respectively. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus three.
