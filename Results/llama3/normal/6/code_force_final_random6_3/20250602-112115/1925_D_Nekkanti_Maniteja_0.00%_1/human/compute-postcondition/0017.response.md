The code prints the value of `s` modulo `M`, where `s` is calculated as `k` * `c` * `a` + (`k` - 1) * `k` / 2 * `c` * `i` * `c` * `m`, and `M` is 1000000007.
Output: ** `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `k` * `c` * `a` + (`k` - 1) * `k` / 2 * `c` * `i` * `c` * `m`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`, `i` is `k` - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed**
