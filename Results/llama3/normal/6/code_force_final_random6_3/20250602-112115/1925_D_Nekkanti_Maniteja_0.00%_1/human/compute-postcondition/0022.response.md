The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input.**
