Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k). It also reads the m lines of input for each pair of friends, which includes their indices (a_i and b_i) and their friendship value (f_i).

2. The program calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 10^9 + 7, which is stored in the variable c. This value is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

3. The program correctly sums up all the friendship values (f_i) for each pair of friends and stores the sum in the variable a.

4. The program then performs a series of calculations to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The calculation involves the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion (c), the sum of friendship values (a), and the number of excursions (k).

5. Finally, the program prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the problem's requirements and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
