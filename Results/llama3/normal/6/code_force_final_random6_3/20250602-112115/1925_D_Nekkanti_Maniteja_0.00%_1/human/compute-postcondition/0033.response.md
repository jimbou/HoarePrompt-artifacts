Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a + ... (k times), a is the original value of a plus the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k - 1, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `s` is updated to be the sum of `c * a` and `k` terms of the form `c * i * c * m`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`. The variable `i` is updated to be `k-1`. The loop has executed `k` times, and there are no more test cases in `stdin`.
