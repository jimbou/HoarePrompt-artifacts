Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
2.  It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n \* (n - 1) modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
3.  The program correctly sums up all the friendship values (f_i) for each pair of friends.
4.  The program then performs a series of calculations to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. This involves calculating the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion, multiplying it by the sum of friendship values, and adding it to the total sum.
5.  Finally, the program prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
