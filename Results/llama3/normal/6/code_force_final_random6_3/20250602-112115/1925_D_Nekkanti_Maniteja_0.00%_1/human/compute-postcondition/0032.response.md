Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` must be at least 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains no more test cases**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to include additional terms. The new value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus `c * i * c * m + c * a`, which can be simplified to `c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
