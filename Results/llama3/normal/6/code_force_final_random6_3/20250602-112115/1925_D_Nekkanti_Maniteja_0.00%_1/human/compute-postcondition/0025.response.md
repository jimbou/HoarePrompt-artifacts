Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus 2f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 2, stdin contains at least one test case minus three inputs.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f, respectively. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by three. The second line increments a by the value of f, effectively adding 2f to its original value. No other variables are affected by the code.
