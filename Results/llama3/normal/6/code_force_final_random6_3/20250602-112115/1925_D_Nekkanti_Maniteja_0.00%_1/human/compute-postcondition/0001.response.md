Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one.**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `M` is set to 1000000007. The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`. The variables `s` and `a` are initialized to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus one.
