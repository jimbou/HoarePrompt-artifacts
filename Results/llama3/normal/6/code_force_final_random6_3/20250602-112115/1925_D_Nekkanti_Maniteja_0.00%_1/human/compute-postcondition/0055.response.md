Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 10^9 + 7, sums up all f_i values, and then performs a series of calculations involving these values, ultimately printing the result modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case. The function does not modify the input values or store any results beyond printing the calculated value for each test case.**
