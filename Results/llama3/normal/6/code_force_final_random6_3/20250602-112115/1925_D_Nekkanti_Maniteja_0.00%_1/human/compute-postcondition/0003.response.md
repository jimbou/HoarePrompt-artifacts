Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f`. It then increments `a` by the value of `f`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that two test cases have been consumed.
