Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the line where the sum `s` is calculated. The correct formula for the expected value should be the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen multiplied by their friendship value, which is not correctly implemented in the program.

A counterexample can be constructed by considering a scenario where there are multiple pairs of friends with different friendship values. The program's calculation of `s` does not take into account the different friendship values of each pair, which would result in an incorrect expected value.

For instance, consider a test case with `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`, and the pairs `(1, 2, 2)` and `(2, 3, 3)`. The program would calculate `s` as `c * 0 * c * 2 + c * (2 + 3)`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the different friendship values of each pair.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
