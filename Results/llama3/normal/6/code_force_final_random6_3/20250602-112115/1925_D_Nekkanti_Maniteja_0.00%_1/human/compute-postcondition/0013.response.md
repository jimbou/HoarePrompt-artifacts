State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `c` * `a` + `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`, `i` is 2, stdin contains no more test cases, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**
