Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is equal to its original value plus f plus u, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains at least one more test case**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`, and `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned integer values from the input. The stdin now contains at least one more test case.
