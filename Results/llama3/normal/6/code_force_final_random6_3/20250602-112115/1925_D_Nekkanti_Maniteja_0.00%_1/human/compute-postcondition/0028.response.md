Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` must be at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * c * m * i`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains no more test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the sum of `c * a` and `c * c * m * i`. Since `i` is 0, the term `c * c * m * i` is also 0, so `s` is now equal to `c * a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
