Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input.**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line increments the value of a by the value of f. No other variables are affected by the code.
