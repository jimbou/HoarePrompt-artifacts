Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one more test case**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of the product of `c`, `i`, `c`, and `m`, and the product of `c` and `a`. The stdin still contains at least one more test case.
