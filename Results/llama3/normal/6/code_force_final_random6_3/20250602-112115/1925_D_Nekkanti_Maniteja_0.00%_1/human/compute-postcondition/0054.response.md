Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a, a is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, and 0 is printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of n, m, and M remain unchanged. The value of k is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The value of c remains the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M. The value of s is now 0, since k is 0. The value of a is the sum of all f values from all test cases. The values of u, v, and f are still integers, but their values are no longer relevant since all test cases have been processed. The value of i is -1, since k is 0. Finally, stdin contains no more test cases, and the value of s modulo M (which is 0) is printed.
