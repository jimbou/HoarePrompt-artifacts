Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo M, s is 0, a is equal to its original value plus f plus u, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 2, stdin contains at least one more test case**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f. The value of a is incremented by the value of f. No other variables are affected.
