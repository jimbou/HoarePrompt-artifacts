Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is `c` * `a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`, `i` is 0, stdin contains no more test cases, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `c` * `a`, where `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, and `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `m` is 0, the term `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` in the expression for `s` evaluates to 0, so it does not contribute to the final value of `s`.
