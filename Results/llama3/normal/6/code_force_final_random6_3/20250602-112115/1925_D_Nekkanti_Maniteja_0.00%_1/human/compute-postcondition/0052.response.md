The code prints the value of `s` modulo `M`. To determine the value of `s`, we need to consider the values of its components: `k`, `c`, `i`, `c`, `m`, and `a`.

`k` is given as 0, so any term multiplied by `k` will be 0. Therefore, the entire expression `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a` simplifies to 0, regardless of the values of `c`, `i`, `m`, and `a`.

Since `s` is 0, the expression `s % M` will also be 0, because 0 modulo any number is 0.

Output: **0**
