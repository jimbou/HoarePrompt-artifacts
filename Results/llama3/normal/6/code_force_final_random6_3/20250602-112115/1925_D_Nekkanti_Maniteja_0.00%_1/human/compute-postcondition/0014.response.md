Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) modulo `M`, `s` is 3 * `c` * `a` + 2 * `c` * `i` * `c` * `m`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` * `f`, `i` is 2, stdin contains no more test cases, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include an additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is equivalent to `c * 2 * c * 0 + c * a` since `i` is 2 and `m` is 0. This simplifies to `c * a`. Therefore, the new value of `s` is `c * a` plus the original value of `s`, which is `c * a` plus `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Since `m` is 0, this further simplifies to `3 * c * a + 2 * c * i * c * m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
