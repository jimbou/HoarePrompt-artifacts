The code prints the value of `n`, which is an integer equal to `(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2`. This expression represents the sum of the squares of the differences between the pairs of integers `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. The values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not explicitly provided, but they are described as integers within the range `-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000` in the precondition.

Output: **(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 (where a, b, e, and f are integers within the range -1000 to 1000)**
