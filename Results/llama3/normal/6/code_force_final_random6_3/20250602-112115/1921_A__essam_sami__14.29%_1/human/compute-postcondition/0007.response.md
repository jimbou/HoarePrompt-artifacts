The code prints the value of `x`, which is the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of two points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`.
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x`.
Output: **x (where x is the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of two points (c, d) and (g, h))**
