Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2.**

In this final state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as one test case has been processed. The values of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are updated based on the input values. The values of n and x are calculated based on the updated values of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h. The value of steps remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
