Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 2, a, b, e, f are integers, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2, and the value of n which is equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 is being printed**
