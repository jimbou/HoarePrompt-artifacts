Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 2, a, b, e, f are integers, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2, and either the value of n which is equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 or the value of x which is equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 is being printed, depending on whether x is greater than n or not.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` have been updated based on the input values. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The value of `steps` remains unchanged. The values of `c` and `d` are no longer present in the output state as they were only used to calculate the value of `x`. The output state now includes the updated values of `n` and `x`, which are calculated based on the input values.
