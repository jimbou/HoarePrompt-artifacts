The code prints the value of `x`, which is an integer equal to `(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2`. This expression represents the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of two points, `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`. Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x`.

Output: **(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 (where c, d, g, and h are integers)**
