Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000) per line.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2. If the current value of x is greater than the current value of n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2, and either the value of n which is equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 or the value of x which is equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 is being printed, depending on whether x is greater than n or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 2, a, b, e, f are integers, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2, and the program prints the larger value between n and x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
