To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `steps` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `steps` and `t`. If `steps` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `steps` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `steps` must be increased by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `steps`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000) per line, `steps` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` are integers, `n` is an integer equal to `(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2`, `x` is an integer equal to `(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2`, and either the value of `n` which is equal to `(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2` or the value of `x` which is equal to `(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2` is being printed, depending on whether `x` is greater than `n` or not.**
