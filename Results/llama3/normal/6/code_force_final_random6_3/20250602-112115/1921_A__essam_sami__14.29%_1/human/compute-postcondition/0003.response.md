Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2, and the current value of x is greater than the current value of n.**
