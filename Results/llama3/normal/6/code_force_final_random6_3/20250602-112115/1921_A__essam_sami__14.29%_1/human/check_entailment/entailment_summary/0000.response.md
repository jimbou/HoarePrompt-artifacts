Reasoning:

The program is attempting to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. It calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points for each test case and prints the larger of the two squared distances. However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program is using the wrong formula to calculate the squared distance. The correct formula is (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2, but the program is using (x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1).

2. The program is comparing the squared distances and printing the larger one. However, the area of the square is the same regardless of which pair of points is used to calculate it. Therefore, the program should print the same value for both pairs of points.

3. The program is not handling the case where the input coordinates are not valid (i.e., they do not form a square).

Correctness: **False**
