Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consisting of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) per line, steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is an integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, x is an integer equal to (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases because one test case has been processed. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are assigned integer values from the input. The variable `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. Similarly, the variable `x` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `c` and `g`, and `d` and `h`. The variable `steps` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
