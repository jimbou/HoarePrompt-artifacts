The code prints the value of `x` which is equal to `(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2`, or the value of `n` which is equal to `(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2`, depending on whether `x` is greater than `n` or not. However, since the print statement only prints `x`, the value of `x` will be printed regardless of whether it is greater than `n` or not.

Output: **(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 (where c, g, d, and h are integers)**
