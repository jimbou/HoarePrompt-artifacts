Reasoning:

1. The problem statement asks to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

3. The program calculates the square of the differences in x and y coordinates between two pairs of points (`(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`). This gives the square of the lengths of two sides of the square.

4. The program then compares the two squared lengths and prints the smaller one. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the lengths of the sides are equal, and the area of the square is the square of the length of one side.

5. The program uses the correct formula to calculate the area of the square, which is the square of the length of one side.

6. The program handles the case where the input coordinates are in random order by comparing the squared lengths of two sides and printing the smaller one.

7. The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are not valid (e.g., not forming a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes). However, the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates form a valid square.

8. The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are not integers. However, the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates are integers.

9. The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are outside the range [-1000, 1000]. However, the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates are within this range.

10. The program does not handle the case where the number of test cases `t` is not within the range [1, 100]. However, the problem statement guarantees that `t` is within this range.

Correctness: **True**
