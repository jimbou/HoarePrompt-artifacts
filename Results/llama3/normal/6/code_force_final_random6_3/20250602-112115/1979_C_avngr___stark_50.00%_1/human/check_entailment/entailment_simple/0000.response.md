Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for the amount of coins for each outcome as input.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the LCM and each multiplier, and divides the LCM by the HCF to get the bet amount for each outcome.

The program then checks if the sum of the bet amounts is less than the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is, the program prints the bet amounts for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the HCF of a list of numbers. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the HCF.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
