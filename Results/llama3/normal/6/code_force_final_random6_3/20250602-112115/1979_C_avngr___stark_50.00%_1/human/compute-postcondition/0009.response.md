Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the input list 'numbers', which also represents the number of elements in the list. It takes a list of integers as input, where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins for each outcome. The function returns the GCD of all elements in the list, which is also the number of elements in the list.**
