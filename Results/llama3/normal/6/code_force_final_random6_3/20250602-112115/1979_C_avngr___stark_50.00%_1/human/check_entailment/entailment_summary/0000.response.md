Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers as input, calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, and then finds the highest common factor (HCF) of the LCM divided by each multiplier. It then checks if the sum of the LCM divided by each multiplier and the HCF is less than the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is, the program prints the LCM divided by each multiplier and the HCF; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the LCM and HCF, and it correctly checks the condition to determine if there is a way to distribute the coins as required. The use of the math.gcd function to calculate the GCD is also correct.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function func_1 is not necessary, and the calculation of the HCF can be done directly in the main loop. This would simplify the program and make it more efficient.

Correctness: **True**
