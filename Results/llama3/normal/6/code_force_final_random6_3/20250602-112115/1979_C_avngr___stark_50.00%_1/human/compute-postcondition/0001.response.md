The only objects in the loop head are variables  num and numbers, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the numbers.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, hcf is the number of test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second element in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the number of test cases, num is the second element in the list**
