Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the second element in the list, `num` is the second element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of its original value (the number of test cases) and `num` (the second element in the list). The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
