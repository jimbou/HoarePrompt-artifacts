Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.
2.  It then calculates the initial bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by each multiplier.
3.  The program finds the highest common factor (HCF) of all the initial bets. This is done by defining a function `func_1` that calculates the HCF of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
4.  The program then divides each initial bet by the HCF to get the final bets. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet while ensuring that the total amount is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
5.  If the total amount of coins bet is greater than or equal to the LCM divided by the HCF, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the final bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
