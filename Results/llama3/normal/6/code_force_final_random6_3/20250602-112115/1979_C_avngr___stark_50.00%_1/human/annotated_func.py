#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins for each outcome, with the first element of each list being the number of outcomes.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least `hcf` elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list, `num` is the last element in the list
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list 'numbers', which is also the number of elements in the list 'numbers'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the input list 'numbers', which also represents the number of elements in the list. It takes a list of integers as input, where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins for each outcome. The function returns the GCD of all elements in the list, which is also the number of elements in the list.
