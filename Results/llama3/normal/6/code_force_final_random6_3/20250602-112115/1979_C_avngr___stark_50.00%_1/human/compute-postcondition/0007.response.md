Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least `hcf` elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list, `num` is the last element in the list**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be such that the list `numbers` will have at least as many elements as the final value of `hcf`, which is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The variable `hcf` will hold this greatest common divisor, and `num` will be the last element in the list.
