Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins for each outcome, with the first element of each list being the number of outcomes, `hcf` is the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the second element in the list, `num` is the second element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the third element in the list and the third element in the list, `num` is the third element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the third element in the list, the third element in the list, and the fourth element in the list, `num` is the fourth element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
