Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, in which case it outputs -1.

The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, but based on the state of the program before the function call, it appears to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the input list. This is used to reduce the bets for each outcome while still ensuring that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
