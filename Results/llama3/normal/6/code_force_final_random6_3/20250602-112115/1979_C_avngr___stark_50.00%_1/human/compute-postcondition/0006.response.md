Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the third element in the list, the third element in the list, and the fourth element in the list, `num` is the fourth element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of its previous value (which was the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the third element in the list) and the fourth element in the list (`num`). The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
