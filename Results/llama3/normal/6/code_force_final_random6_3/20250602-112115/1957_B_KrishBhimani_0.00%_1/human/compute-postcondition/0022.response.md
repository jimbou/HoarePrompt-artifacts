To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arr` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `k0` and another element which is 1 shifted to the left by `i`, `c` is equal to `n`**
