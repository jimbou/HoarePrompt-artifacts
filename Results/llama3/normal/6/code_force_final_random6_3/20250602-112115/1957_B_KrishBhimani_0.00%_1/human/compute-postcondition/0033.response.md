The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`. Since `arr` is an empty list, the elements in `ans` are all 1 (1 shifted to the left by 0). The last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, which is `k0 - n` (since there are `n` elements in `ans`, each of which is 1).

Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is out of range of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are printed: `[1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n]`**
