Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 2 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the second element of arr, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing four elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, 1 shifted to the left by i, and k0 - sum(ans).**

The code block increments the value of `c` by 1, making it equal to `n`. Then, it appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Since `c` is now equal to `n`, the condition `if c is equal to n - 1` is not met, and the list `ans` is modified by appending the new value. The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the updated values of `c` and `ans`.
