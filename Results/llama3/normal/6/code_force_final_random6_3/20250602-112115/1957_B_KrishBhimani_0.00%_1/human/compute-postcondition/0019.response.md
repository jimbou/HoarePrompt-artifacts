Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 1 element, which is the binary representation of k0 in reverse order, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the first element of arr, ans is a list containing one element which is k0, and the current value of c is equal to n - 1.**

The first line appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially empty, `sum(ans)` is 0, so `k0` is appended to `ans`. The second line breaks the loop, but since there is no loop in the given code snippet, it doesn't have any effect. No other variables are affected.
