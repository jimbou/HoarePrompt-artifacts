Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of times the loop executed, c is equal to n + the number of times the loop executed minus 1, ans is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus 1 elements: k0, 1, 1 << i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, otherwise ans is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus 1 elements: k0, 1, and 1 << i.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The number of times the loop executed is equal to the length of the list `arr`, which is now empty. The variable `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and `c` is equal to `n` plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1. The list `ans` contains the number of times the loop executed plus 1 elements, which are `k0`, 1, and `1 << i` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `ans` contains the number of times the loop executed plus 1 elements, which are `k0`, 1, and `1 << i`. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
