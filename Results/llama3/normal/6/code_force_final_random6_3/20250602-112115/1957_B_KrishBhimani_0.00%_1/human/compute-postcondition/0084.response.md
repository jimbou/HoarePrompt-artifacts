Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of times the loop executed, c is 0, ans is an empty list**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line initializes an empty list `ans`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line assigns the value 0 to `c`, overwriting its previous value of `n - 1`. The remaining variables (`n`, `k`, `_`, `stdin`, `l1`, `arr`, `k0`, and `i`) are not affected by the code snippet and retain their initial values.
