Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1 and must have at least 2 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n + 1, ans is a list containing three elements: k0, 1, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, otherwise ans is a list containing three elements: k0, 1, and 1 << i.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1, making it equal to `n + 1`. The second line appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 1, `1 << i` equals 2. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` contains three elements: `k0`, 1, and `k0 - sum(ans)`. Otherwise, `ans` contains three elements: `k0`, 1, and 2.
