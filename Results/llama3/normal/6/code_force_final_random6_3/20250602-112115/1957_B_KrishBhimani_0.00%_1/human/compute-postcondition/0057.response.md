Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 4 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places if c was equal to n - 1, otherwise the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, and the second element is equal to k0 - the first element of ans.**

Explanation: The first line appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` initially contains one element equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places, the new element will be equal to `k0 - (1 shifted left by i places)`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` is reduced by one line, as one line is read by the `input()` function. The value of `l1` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `arr` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k0` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `c` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is modified, as a new element is appended to it.
