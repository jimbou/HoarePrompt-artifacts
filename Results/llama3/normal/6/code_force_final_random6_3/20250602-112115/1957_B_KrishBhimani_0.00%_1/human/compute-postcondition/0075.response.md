According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is a non-zero integer divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 2 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing one integer which is 0 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.**
