The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than 1 and is a quarter of its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, if k is odd, arr is a list containing one integer which is 1, otherwise arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: if k is odd, [1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n - 1], otherwise [1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n]**
