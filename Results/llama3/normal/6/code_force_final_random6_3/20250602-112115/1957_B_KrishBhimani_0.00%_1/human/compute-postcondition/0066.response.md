The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains `n` elements. The first `i` - 1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the corresponding element in the original list `arr`. However, since `arr` is an empty list, these elements will be equal to 1 shifted left by 0, which is simply 1. Therefore, the first `i` - 1 elements of `ans` will be equal to 1.

The last `i` - 1 elements of `ans` are also equal to 1 shifted left by the corresponding element in the original list `arr`. Again, since `arr` is an empty list, these elements will be equal to 1 shifted left by 0, which is simply 1. Therefore, the last `i` - 1 elements of `ans` will also be equal to 1.

The last `n` - `i` elements of `ans` are equal to 0.

The last element of `ans` is equal to `k0` - the sum of the first `i` - 1 elements. Since the first `i` - 1 elements are all equal to 1, their sum is equal to `i` - 1. Therefore, the last element of `ans` is equal to `k0` - (`i` - 1).

In summary, the `ans` list will contain `i` - 1 ones, followed by `i` - 1 ones, followed by `n` - `i` zeros, and finally `k0` - (`i` - 1).

Output: **[1] * (i - 1) + [1] * (i - 1) + [0] * (n - i) + [k0 - (i - 1)]**
