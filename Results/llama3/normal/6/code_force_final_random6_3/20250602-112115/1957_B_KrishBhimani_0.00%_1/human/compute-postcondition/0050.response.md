Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is 0, ans is an empty list.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reinitializes the list `ans` to an empty list, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line assigns the value 0 to the variable `c`, overwriting its previous value which was equal to `n`. 

All other variables remain unaffected by the code snippet. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` remains 0, `_` remains 1, stdin still contains t - 3 lines each containing two integers, `l1` still contains two strings, `arr` still contains the binary representation of the original value of `k`, `k0` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` remains equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`.
