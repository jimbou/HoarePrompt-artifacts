Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 1 element, which is the binary representation of k0 in reverse order, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the first element of arr, ans is a list containing one element which is k0 and another element which is 1 shifted to the left by i, c is equal to n.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and the list `ans` has been appended with the value `1 << i`, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of `i`. The value of `i` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is the binary representation of `k0` in reverse order. The value of `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The value of `k` is 0. The value of `_` is 0. The value of `stdin` contains `t` - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The value of `l1` is a list containing two strings. The value of `arr` is a list containing at least 1 element, which is the binary representation of `k0` in reverse order.
