Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 3 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the third element of arr, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing four elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, 1 shifted to the left by i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing five elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, 1 shifted to the left by i, k0 - sum(ans), and k0 - sum(ans).**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1, making it equal to `n`. The second line appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` contains five elements; otherwise, it contains four elements. The values of `n`, `k`, `_`, `l1`, `arr`, `k0`, and `i` remain unchanged.
