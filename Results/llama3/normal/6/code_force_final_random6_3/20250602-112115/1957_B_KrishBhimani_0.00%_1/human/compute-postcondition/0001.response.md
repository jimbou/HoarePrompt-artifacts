Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 0**

The first line reads the first line from stdin, which contains two integers n and k, and splits it into a list of strings l1. The second line converts the first two elements of l1 into integers and assigns them to n and k, respectively. The third line initializes an empty list arr. The fourth line assigns the value of k to k0. The fifth line initializes a variable i to 0. 

Note that the value of t is not explicitly used in the code snippet, but it is mentioned in the initial state that stdin contains t lines. After the first line is read, there are t - 1 lines left in stdin.
