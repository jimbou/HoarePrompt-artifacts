To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `arr`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list `arr`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 3` lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `k` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`, `c` is equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places and the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places.**
