Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i places if c was equal to n - 1, otherwise ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i places. If c was equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places and the second element is equal to k0 - the first element of ans.***
