Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 2 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the second element of arr, ans is a list containing three elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, and k0 - sum(ans), c is equal to n**

The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is the difference between `k0` and the sum of all elements in `ans`. This operation does not affect any other variables. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as does the value of `k`, `_`, `l1`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, and `c`. The only change is in the list `ans`, which now contains three elements.
