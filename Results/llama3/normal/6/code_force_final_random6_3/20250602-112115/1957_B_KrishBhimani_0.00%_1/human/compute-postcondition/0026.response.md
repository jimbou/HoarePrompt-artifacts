The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `arr` must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element of `arr`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing four elements: `k0`, 1 shifted to the left by `i`, 1 shifted to the left by `i`, and `k0` - sum(ans)**
