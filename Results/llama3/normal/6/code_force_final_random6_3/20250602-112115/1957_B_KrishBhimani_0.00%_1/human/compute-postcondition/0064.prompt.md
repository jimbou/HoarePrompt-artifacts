Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is 0, ans is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i places if c was equal to n - 1, otherwise ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i places.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n + 1, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places and the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n + 2, if c is equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, and the third element is equal to k0 - 2 * (1 shifted left by i places). Otherwise, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, and the third element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
