Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing a single element 1, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and i is 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `i`. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. This means `k` will be an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
