Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is out of range of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are printed: `[1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`, `c` is equal to `n` + `i` - 1, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: the first `i` - 1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the corresponding element in the original list `arr`, the last `i` - 1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the corresponding element in the original list `arr`, and the last `n` - `i` elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to `k0` - the sum of the first `i` - 1 elements, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two integers, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `c` is equal to `n` + the number of times the loop executed minus 1, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: `k0`, 1, 1 << `i`, and `n` - `i` - 2 zeros if `c` is equal to `n` - 1, otherwise `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: `k0`, 1, 1 << `i`, and `n` - `i` - 2 zeros, and the elements of `ans` are printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
