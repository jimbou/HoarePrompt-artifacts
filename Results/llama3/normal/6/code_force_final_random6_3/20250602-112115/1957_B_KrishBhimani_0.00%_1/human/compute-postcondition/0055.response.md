Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i places if c was equal to n - 1, otherwise ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i places.**

The first line increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was either 0 or `n - 1`, it becomes either 1 or `n`. The second line appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`, this operation effectively appends the value of `1` shifted left by `i` places to the list `ans`. The value of `ans` depends on the original value of `c`. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` now contains one element equal to `1` shifted left by `i` places. Otherwise, `ans` now contains one element equal to `1` shifted left by `i` places. No other variables are affected.
