Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n + 1, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places and the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places.**

The code block modifies the values of `c` and `ans`. The first line increments `c` by 1, making it equal to `n + 1`. The second line appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places. Since `i` is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`, this new element is equal to 1 shifted left by the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. The list `ans` now contains two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places, and the second element is also equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places.
