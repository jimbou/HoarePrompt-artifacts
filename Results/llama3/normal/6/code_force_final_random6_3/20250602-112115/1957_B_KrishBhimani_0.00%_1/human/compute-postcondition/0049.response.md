Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: [1, 2, ..., 1, k0 - n - (number of 1s in the binary representation of the original value of k)].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of k becomes 0, the value of i becomes equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, and the list arr contains the binary representation of the original value of k. The other variables remain unchanged. The list ans contains n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans). The elements of ans are printed, with the first n-1 elements being powers of 2, and the last element being k0 - n - (number of 1s in the binary representation of the original value of k).
