Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to `n`, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing two integers: 1 and 2, `ans` is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: [1, 2, ..., 1, k0 - n - 2]. If `k` is even, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: [1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n].**
