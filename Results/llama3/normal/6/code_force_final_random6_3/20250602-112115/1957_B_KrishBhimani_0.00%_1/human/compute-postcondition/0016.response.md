Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of k0 in reverse order, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, ans is an empty list, c is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which introduce new variables. The first line creates an empty list called `ans`, and the second line initializes a variable `c` to 0. These lines do not modify any existing variables or consume any input from stdin. Therefore, the state of all variables and stdin remains unchanged, except for the addition of the new variables `ans` and `c`.
