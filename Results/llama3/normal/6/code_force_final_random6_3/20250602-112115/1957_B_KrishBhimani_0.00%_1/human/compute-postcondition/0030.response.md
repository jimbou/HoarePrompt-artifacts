Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is out of range of arr, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop counter `c` has reached the value of `n`, and the list `ans` contains `n` elements, each of which is a power of 2 corresponding to the binary representation of `k0`. The last element of `ans` is the difference between `k0` and the sum of all the previous elements in `ans`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
