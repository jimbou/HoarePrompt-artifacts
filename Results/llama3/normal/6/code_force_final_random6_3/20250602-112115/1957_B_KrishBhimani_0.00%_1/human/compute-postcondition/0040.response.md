Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is non-zero and is half of its original value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing one integer which is 0 if k is odd, otherwise arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: [1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n].**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been halved due to the right shift operation `k = k >> 1`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
