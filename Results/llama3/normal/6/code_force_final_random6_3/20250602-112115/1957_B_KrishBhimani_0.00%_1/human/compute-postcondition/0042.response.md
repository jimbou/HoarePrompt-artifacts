Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1 and is half of its original value, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing one integer which is 1 if k is odd, otherwise arr is a list containing one integer which is 1, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, `c` is equal to n, `ans` is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: [1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n - 1]**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is 1, the list `arr` now contains one integer which is 1 if k is odd, otherwise arr is a list containing one integer which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The elements of `ans` are also updated, with each element being 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`. The elements of `ans` are printed as [1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n - 1].
