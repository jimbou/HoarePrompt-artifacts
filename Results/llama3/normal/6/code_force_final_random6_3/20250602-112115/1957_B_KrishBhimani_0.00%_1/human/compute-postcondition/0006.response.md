Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing a single element 0 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been halved due to the right shift operation `k = k >> 1`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 due to the statement `i += 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
