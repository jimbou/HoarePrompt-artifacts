Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 6 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr is a list containing two integers: 1 and 2, otherwise arr is a list containing one integer which is 2, and k is greater than 0**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is 2, the list `arr` now contains an additional element, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t - 6` lines, each containing two integers, because one line has been read. The list `ans` is still being printed.
