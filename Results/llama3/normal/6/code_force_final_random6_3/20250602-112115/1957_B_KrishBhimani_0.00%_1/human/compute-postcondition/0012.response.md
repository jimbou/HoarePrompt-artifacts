Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` is 2**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. The value of `i` is 2, so the list `arr` now contains two elements: 1 and 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
