Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of k0 in reverse order, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, ans is an empty list, c is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 1 element, which is the binary representation of k0 in reverse order, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the first element of arr, ans is a list containing one element which is k0 and another element which is 1 shifted to the left by i, c is equal to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 2 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the second element of arr, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing four elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, 1 shifted to the left by i, and k0 - sum(ans).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing at least 3 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is the third element of arr, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing four elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, 1 shifted to the left by i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing five elements: k0, 1 shifted to the left by i, 1 shifted to the left by i, k0 - sum(ans), and k0 - sum(ans).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
