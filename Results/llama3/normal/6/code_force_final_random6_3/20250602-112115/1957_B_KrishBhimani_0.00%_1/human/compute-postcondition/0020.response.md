Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing at least 1 element, which is the binary representation of `k0` in reverse order, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `ans` is a list. If the current value of `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` contains one element which is `k0`.***
