The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. Since `i` is 0, the list `arr` now contains a single element, which is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an odd integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` is 0.**
