Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 6 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 3, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr is a list containing two integers: 1 and 2, otherwise arr is a list containing one integer which is 2, and k is greater than 0**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `i`. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. Since `k` was initially a non-zero integer divided by 4 and greater than 0, after the division, it becomes a non-zero integer divided by 8 and greater than 0. The second line increments `i` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
