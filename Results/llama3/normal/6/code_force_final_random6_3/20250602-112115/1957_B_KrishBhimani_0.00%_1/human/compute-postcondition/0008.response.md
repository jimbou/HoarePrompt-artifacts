Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 1/2 * 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `k` is odd, otherwise it is a list containing a single element 1, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 1. If `k` is odd, `arr` now contains a single element 1. If `k` is even, `arr` now contains a single element 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
