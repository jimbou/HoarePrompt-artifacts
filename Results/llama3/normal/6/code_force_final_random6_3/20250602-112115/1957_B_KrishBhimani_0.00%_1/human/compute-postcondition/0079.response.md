The variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k.  If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr is a list containing one integer which is 1, otherwise arr is an empty list, and k is greater than 0**
