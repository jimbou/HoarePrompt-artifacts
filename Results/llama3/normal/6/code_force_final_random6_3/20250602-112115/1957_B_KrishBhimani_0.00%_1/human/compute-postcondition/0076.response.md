Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 2 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing one integer which is 1 if k is odd, otherwise it is a list containing one integer which is 1, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n is still between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is still a non-zero integer divided by 2 and greater than 0, _ is still 2, stdin still contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is still a list containing two integers, arr is now a list containing one integer which is 1 if k is odd, otherwise it is a list containing one integer which is 1, k0 is still an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is still 1, c is still equal to n - 1, ans is still a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are still being printed.
