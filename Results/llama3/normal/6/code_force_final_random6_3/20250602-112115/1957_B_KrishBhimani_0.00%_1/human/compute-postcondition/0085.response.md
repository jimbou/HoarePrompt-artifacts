The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, which is 0, and `arr` contains integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1. So for the loop to be executed `arr` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two integers, `arr` is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1 and must have at least 1 element, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list**
