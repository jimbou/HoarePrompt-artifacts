Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 0, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing one integer which is 0 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr is a list containing one integer which is 1, otherwise arr is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 6 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 3, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr is a list containing two integers: 1 and 2, otherwise arr is a list containing one integer which is 2, and k is greater than 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
