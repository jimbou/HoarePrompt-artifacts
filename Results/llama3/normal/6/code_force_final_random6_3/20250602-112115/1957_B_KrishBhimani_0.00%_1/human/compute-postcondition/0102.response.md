Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is equal to `t`, stdin is empty, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `c` is equal to `n` + the number of times the loop executed minus 1, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: `k0`, 1, 1 << `i`, and `n` - `i` - 2 zeros if `c` is equal to `n` - 1, otherwise `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: `k0`, 1, 1 << `i`, and `n` - `i` - 2 zeros, and the elements of `ans` are printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of lines in the input.
- The input has been fully processed, and the input stream is empty.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `l1`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, and `c` have the same values as in the previous iterations, but `i` is now equal to the number of times the loop executed.
- The list `ans` contains `n` elements, which are the results of the last iteration of the loop. If `c` is equal to `n` - 1, the last element of `ans` is `k0` - the sum of the first `i` - 1 elements. Otherwise, the last element of `ans` is `k0`.
- The elements of `ans` are printed to the output.
