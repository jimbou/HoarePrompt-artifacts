Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 0, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed**

The first line reads a line from stdin and splits it into two strings, assigning them to `l1`. The second line converts these strings to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The third line initializes an empty list `arr`. The fourth line assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. The fifth line sets `i` to 0. The sixth line calculates `c` as `n` + `i` - 1, which is equal to `n` - 1. The seventh line initializes `ans` with `n` elements: the first `n` - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to `k0`. The elements of the list `ans` are being printed.
