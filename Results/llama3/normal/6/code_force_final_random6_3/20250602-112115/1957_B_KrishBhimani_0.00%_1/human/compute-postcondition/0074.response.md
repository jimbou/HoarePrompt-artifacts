Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is a non-zero integer divided by 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing one integer which is 0 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.**

The code block modifies the values of `k` and `i`. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. The second line increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
