To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Here, the variable `_` is the loop variable, and `int(input())` is the range over which the loop iterates. The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5
- `k` is 0
- `_` is 0
- stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`
- `l1` is a list containing two strings
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9
- `i` is out of range of `arr`
- `c` is equal to `n`
- `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are printed: `[1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n]`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop variable `_` and the range `int(input())`. Since `_` is the loop variable, its value will increment by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The range `int(input())` depends on the input from stdin.

Given that stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and assuming that the loop has executed t - 1 times, the next iteration will depend on the next line of input. Therefore, the range `int(input())` should be greater than the current value of `_` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is out of range of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are printed: `[1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n]`**
