Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n + i - 1, ans is a list containing i elements: the first i - 1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the corresponding element in the original list arr, and the last element is equal to k0 - the sum of the first i - 1 elements.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates over the list `arr`, which contains the binary representation of the original value of `k`. In each iteration, the loop appends an element to the list `ans`, which is equal to 1 shifted left by the current element in `arr`. If the loop reaches the last iteration, it appends an element to `ans` that is equal to `k0` minus the sum of all the previous elements in `ans`. The loop terminates when it has iterated over all elements in `arr`, and the final state of the variables is as described above.
