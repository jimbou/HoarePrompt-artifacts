According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9. This already ensures that the loop will execute again, so no adjustments are needed.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing a single element 1, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and i is 2**
