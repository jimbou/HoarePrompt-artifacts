Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is out of range of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`.**

The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to the end of the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains `n` elements, the length of `ans` is already equal to `n`. Therefore, `n - len(ans)` is 0, and no zeros are appended to `ans`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
