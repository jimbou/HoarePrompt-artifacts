Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1 and must have at least 3 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, c is equal to n + 1. If c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing four elements: k0, 1, 1 << i, and k0 - sum(ans). Otherwise, ans is a list containing three elements: k0, 1, and 1 << i.***
