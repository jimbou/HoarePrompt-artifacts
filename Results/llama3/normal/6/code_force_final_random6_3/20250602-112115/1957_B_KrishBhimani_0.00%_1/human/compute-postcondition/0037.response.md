Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` must be non-zero, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are printed: `[1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n]`. The current value of `k` is odd.***
