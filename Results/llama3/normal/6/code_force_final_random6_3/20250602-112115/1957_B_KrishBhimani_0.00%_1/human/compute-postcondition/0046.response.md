Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to `n`, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `arr` is a list containing two integers: 1 and 2, `ans` is a list containing n elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in arr, and the last element is k0 - sum(ans), and the elements of ans are printed: if k is odd, [1, 2, ..., 1, k0 - n - 2], otherwise [1, 2, ..., 1, k0 - n - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The value of `ans` has also been updated to reflect the new value in `arr`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
