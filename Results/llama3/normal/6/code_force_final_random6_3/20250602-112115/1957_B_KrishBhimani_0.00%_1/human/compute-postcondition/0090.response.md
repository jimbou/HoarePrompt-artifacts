The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 element, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1 and must have at least 2 elements, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing two elements: k0 and 1**
