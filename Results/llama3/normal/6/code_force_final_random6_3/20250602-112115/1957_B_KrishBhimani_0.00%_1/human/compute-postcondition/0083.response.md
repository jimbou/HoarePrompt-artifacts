Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of times the loop executed, c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n - 1 elements are equal to 0, and the last element is equal to k0, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The variable k is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable i has reached the number of times the loop executed, and the list arr contains integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
