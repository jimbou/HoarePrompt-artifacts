Based on the initial state, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains `n` elements, each of which is 1 shifted to the left by the corresponding element in `arr`. However, since `arr` is an empty list, all elements in `ans` will be 1 (which is equivalent to 1 shifted to the left by 0).

The last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. Since `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `sum(ans)` is the sum of all elements in `ans` (which are all 1), the last element will be `k0 - n`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print `n` ones, followed by `k0 - n`.

Output: **1, 1, ..., 1, k0 - n (where there are n ones and k0 - n is the last element)**
