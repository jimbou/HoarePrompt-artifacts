Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of k0 in reverse order, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of k will be 0, and the list arr will contain the binary representation of k0 in reverse order. The number of bits in the binary representation of k0 is stored in the variable i. The other variables remain unchanged.
