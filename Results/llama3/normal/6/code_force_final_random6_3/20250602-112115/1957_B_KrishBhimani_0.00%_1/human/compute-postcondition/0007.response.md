The variable in the loop head is k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k.  If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer between 1/2 and 1/2 * 10^9, So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 1/2 * 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing a single element 0 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and i is 1**
