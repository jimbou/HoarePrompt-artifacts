Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two strings, arr is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of k that must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list arr, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of k, c is equal to n + 2, if c is equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, and the third element is equal to k0 - 2 * (1 shifted left by i places). Otherwise, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places, and the third element is equal to 1 shifted left by i places.**

The code increments `c` by 1, making it equal to `n + 2`. The second line appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`, which is 0, `1 << i` is equal to 1. Therefore, `ans` now contains three elements: the first two elements are equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places, and the third element is also equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places.
