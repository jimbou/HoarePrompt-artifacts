Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of n elements, where the first elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the binary representation of k, and the remaining elements are zeros, except for the last element, which is the remaining value of k after subtracting the sum of the powers of 2. The function then prints the generated list for each test case.**
