Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, `l1` is a list containing two integers, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `c` is equal to `n` + the number of times the loop executed minus 1, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: `k0`, 1, 1 << `i`, and `n` - `i` - 2 zeros if `c` is equal to `n` - 1, otherwise `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: `k0`, 1, 1 << `i`, and `n` - `i` - 2 zeros.**

In this output state, the length of the list `ans` has been updated to `n` by adding zeros to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `ans` now contains `n` elements, with the first three elements being `k0`, 1, and 1 << `i`, and the remaining elements being zeros. The number of zeros added to `ans` is `n` - `i` - 2, which is calculated based on the value of `i` and `n`.
