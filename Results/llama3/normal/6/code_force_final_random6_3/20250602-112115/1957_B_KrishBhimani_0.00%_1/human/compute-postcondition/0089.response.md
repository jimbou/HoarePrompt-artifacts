Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 5 lines, each containing two integers, l1 is a list containing two integers, arr is a list containing integers from 0 to the number of times the loop executed minus 1 and must have at least 1 element, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 0, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing two elements: k0 and 1.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1, making it equal to `n`. Then, it appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `1 << i` equals 1. Therefore, the list `ans` now contains two elements: `k0` and 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
