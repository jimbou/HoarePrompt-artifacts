To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `arr` contains the binary representation of `k0` in reverse order, we know that `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, so `arr` must have at least 1 element (the least significant bit of `k0`).

Therefore, we can adjust the state of `arr` to have at least 1 element, and the state of `i` to be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` - 1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` is a list containing two strings, `arr` is a list containing at least 1 element, which is the binary representation of `k0` in reverse order, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
