Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character `i` in the string `s` is 'A', then `ac` is increased by 1 and `bc` remains the same as before. If the second character `i` in the string `s` is 'B', then `ac` remains the same as before and `bc` is increased by 1.***
