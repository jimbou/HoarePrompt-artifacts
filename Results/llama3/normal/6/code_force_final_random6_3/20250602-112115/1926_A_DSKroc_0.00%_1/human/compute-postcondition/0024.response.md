Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32, q is 1, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus one, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, i is the first character in the string s, and i is not 'A'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of bc has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The string s still has a length of 5 and consists of letters A and B, with at least one character. The value of t is still between 1 and 32, q is still 1, and the number of 'A's in the string s is still ac. The first character in the string s is still i, which is not 'A'. The stdin still contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
