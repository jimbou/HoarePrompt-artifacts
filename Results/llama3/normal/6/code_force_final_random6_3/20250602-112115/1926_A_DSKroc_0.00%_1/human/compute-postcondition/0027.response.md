Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32, q is 1, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string s, i, is 'A', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 2, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s. Otherwise, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains the same, q remains 1, and s remains a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B with at least 2 characters. The number of strings in stdin remains t-3. The value of ac has increased by 1. If the first character of s is 'A', then ac is now the number of 'A's in s plus 2, and bc remains the number of 'B's in s. If the first character of s is 'B', then ac is now the number of 'A's in s plus 1, and bc remains the number of 'B's in s plus one.
