The only variable in the loop head is variable  q and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `q` and `t`. If `q` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be increased by 1 so `q` is 1 and `t` is still an integer between 1 and 32.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32, q is 1, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, bc is the number of 'B's in the string s, s is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**
