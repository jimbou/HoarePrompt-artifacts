Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the frequency of 'A' and 'B' is equal. In such cases, the program will always print 'B', whereas the problem description does not specify what to do in such cases. 

For example, if the input string is "ABABA", the program will print 'B', but it should either print 'A' or handle this case differently according to the problem description.

Here is the corrected code:

```
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif ac < bc:
            print('B')
        else:
            print("Equal")  # or handle this case according to the problem description

```
