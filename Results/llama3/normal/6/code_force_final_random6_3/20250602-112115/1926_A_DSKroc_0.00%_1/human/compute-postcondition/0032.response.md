Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `ac` remains the same as before, `bc` is increased by 1, stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
