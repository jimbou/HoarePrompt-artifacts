Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32, q is 0, ac is 1, bc is 0, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, the first character of the string, i, is 'A', stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of ac has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
