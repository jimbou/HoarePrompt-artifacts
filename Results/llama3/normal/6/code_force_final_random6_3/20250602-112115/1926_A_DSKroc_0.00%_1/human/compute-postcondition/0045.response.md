Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 32, q is 2, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string s, i, is 'A', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus one. If the first character of the string s, i, is not 'A', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus two.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of bc has been incremented by 1. The value of bc now depends on the first character of the string s. If the first character is 'A', bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus one. If the first character is not 'A', bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus two.
