Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 32, q is 2, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-4 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string s, i, is 'A', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 2, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s. If the first character of the string s, i, is 'B', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus two.**
