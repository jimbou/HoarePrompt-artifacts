Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index, `i` is less than or equal to 4, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still has a length of at least 6, and `s` is still a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index. The integer `n` remains unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
