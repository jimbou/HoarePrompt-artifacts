Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3, `i` is less than or equal to 6, and stdin contains t-4 test cases if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is less than or equal to 4 and stdin contains t-3 test cases. Additionally, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', ans is increased by 1.***
