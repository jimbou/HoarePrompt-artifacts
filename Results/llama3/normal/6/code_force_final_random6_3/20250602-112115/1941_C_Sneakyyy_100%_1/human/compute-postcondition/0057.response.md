Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3 if `i` is 1 or 2, and a length of at least 5 if `i` is 3 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, if `s` was either 'map' or 'pie' before the if else block, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If `s` was not 'map' or 'pie' before the if else block, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' after the if else block, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
