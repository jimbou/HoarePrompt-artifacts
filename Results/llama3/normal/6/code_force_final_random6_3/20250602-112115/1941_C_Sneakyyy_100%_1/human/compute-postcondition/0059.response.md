Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index, `i` is less than or equal to 3, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
