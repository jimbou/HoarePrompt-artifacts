Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 7 or 9 or 5 or 4 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5 or 7. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3 or 2, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 5 or 7. Otherwise, `i` is now 3 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
