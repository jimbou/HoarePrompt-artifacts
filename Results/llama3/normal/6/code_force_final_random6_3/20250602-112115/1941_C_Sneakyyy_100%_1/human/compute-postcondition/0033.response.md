Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first test case, a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3, ans is 2 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise ans is 1, i is 6 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 4, s is a substring of a with length 3 starting at index i, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code increments `i` by 3, making it 6 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise it becomes 4. The code also increments `ans` by 1, making it 2 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise it becomes 1. No other variables are affected.
