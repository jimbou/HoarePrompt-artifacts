Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 7 or 9 or 5 or 4 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 or 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 or 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditionals related to `ans` and `i` are still valid, but now `s` has a new value based on the substring of `a` starting at index `i`.
