The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a. If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 1 and a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3. If i is 3, then a must be at least 5 characters long, otherwise, a must be at least 3 characters long. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first test case, a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3, ans is 1 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise ans is 0, i is 3 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 1, s is a substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
