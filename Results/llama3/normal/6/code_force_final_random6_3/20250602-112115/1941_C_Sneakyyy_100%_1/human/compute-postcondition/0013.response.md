Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 4 characters if `i` is 1 or 2 or at least 5 characters if `i` is 3 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` or `i` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 or 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 or 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.***
