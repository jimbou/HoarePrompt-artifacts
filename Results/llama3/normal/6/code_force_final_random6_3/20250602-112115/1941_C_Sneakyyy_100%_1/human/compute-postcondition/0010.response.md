Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 4 characters if `i` is 1 or at least 5 characters if `i` is 3, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` has at least 4 characters if `i` is 1 or at least 5 characters if `i` is 3 is still valid. The value of `s` is now a substring of `a` starting at index `i`, which can be either 'map' or 'pie' if `i` is 3, or neither 'map' nor 'pie' if `i` is 1.
