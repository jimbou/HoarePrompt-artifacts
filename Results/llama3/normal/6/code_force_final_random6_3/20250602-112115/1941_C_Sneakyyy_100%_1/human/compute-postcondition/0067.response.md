Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. It then counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each string s and prints the count for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the standard input is empty.**
