The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a.  If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 6 or 4 or 2 and a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of a must be greater than i + 2. So the length of a must be greater than 8 if i is 6, otherwise the length of a must be greater than 6 if i is 4, otherwise the length of a must be greater than 4. Also, the length of a must be at least 5 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise the length of a must be at least 3. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, a must be a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5. Also, i is either 6 or 4 or 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5, `ans` is either 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is either 6 or 4 or 2, `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
