The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `t-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `_` is equal to `t` and `stdin` contains `t` test cases.
State: **`stdin` contains `t` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is ans is being printed**
