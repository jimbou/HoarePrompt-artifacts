Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3, `ans` is 1 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 4, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
