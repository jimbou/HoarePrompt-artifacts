Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be such that `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases, `n` remains an integer greater than 0, and `a` remains the same string. The variable `ans` will hold the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in string `a`. The index `i` will be positioned at the third last character of string `a` (since the loop stops when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`). The substring `s` will be the last 3 characters of string `a` starting at index `i`.
