Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3, `ans` is 1 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 3 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i`. The value of `i` depends on whether the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie'. If it is, then `i` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
