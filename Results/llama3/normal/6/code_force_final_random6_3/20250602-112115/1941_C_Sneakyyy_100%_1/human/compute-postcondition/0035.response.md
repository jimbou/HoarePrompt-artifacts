Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3. If the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 if the substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2. `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
