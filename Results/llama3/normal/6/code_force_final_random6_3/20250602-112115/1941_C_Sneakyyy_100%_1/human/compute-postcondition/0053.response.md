According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `a` has a length of at least 3. If `i` is 1, then `a` can still have a length of at least 3. However, if `i` is 3, then `a` must have a length of at least 5 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3 if `i` is 1, and a length of at least 5 if `i` is 3, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the 0th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
