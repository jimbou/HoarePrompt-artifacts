Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, ans is 0, i is 0, _ is 0**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. It then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The variables `ans` and `i` are initialized to 0, and the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
