Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5, `ans` is either 3 or 2 or 1, `i` is either 9 or 7 or 5, `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i-3`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases if `s` is 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5, `ans` is either 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is either 7 or 5 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i-1`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
