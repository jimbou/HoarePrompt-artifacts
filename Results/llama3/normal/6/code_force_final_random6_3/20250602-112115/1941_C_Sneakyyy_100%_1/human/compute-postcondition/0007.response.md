The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The string `a` still has at least 3 characters. The value of `ans` is still 0. The variable `_` is still 0. The substring `s` is still a substring of `a` starting at index 0 with length 3, and it is neither 'map' nor 'pie'. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0.

Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 0 with length 3, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**
