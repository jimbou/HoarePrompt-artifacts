Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 0 with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.***
