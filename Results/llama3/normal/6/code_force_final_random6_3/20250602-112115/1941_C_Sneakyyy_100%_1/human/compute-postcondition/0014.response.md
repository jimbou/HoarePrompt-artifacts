The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a.  If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 4 or 6 or 2 or 1, and a has at least 4 characters if i is 1 or 2 or at least 5 characters if i is 3 or 4. For the loop to be executed one more time, i must be less than len(a) - 2. So, for i = 4 or 6 or 2 or 1, a must have at least 7 or 9 or 5 or 4 characters respectively. Also, since a has at least 4 characters if i is 1 or 2 or at least 5 characters if i is 3 or 4, a must have at least 5 characters if i is 4 or 6.
State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 7 or 9 or 5 or 4 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` or `i` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 or 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 or 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**
