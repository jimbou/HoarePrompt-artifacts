Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the 0th index, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The string `a` still has a length of at least 3, `ans` remains 0, `s` is still a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the 0th index, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'. Additionally, the number of test cases in stdin remains t-3.
