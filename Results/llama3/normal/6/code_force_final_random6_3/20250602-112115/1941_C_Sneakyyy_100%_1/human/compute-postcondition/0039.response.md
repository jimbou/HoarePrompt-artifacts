Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first test case, `a` is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 5, `ans` is either 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is either 7 or 5 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index `i-1`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 7, 5, or 3. The value of `s` is still a substring of `a` with length 3, but it now starts at index `i-1` instead of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
