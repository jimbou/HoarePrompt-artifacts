Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first test case, a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3, ans is 1 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise ans is 0, i is 3 if the substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 1, s is a substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
