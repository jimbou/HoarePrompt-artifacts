Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads a series of test cases from standard input, counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each string, and prints the count for each test case.

The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string, checking every 3-character substring to see if it matches 'map' or 'pie'. If a match is found, the loop counter is incremented by 3 to skip over the matched substring, and the answer counter is incremented by 1. If no match is found, the loop counter is incremented by 1 to move on to the next character.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') by printing 0 in this case.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
