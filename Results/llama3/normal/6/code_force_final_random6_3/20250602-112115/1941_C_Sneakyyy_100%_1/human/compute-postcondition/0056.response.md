Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3 if `i` is 2, and a length of at least 5 if `i` is 4, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 4. The length of string `a` is still at least 3 if `i` is 2, and at least 5 if `i` is 4. The substring `s` is still a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index. The values of `n`, `ans`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
