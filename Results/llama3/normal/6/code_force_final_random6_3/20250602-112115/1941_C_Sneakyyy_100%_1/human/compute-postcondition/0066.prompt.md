Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a string s of length n. 1 <= t <= 10^4 and 1 <= n <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first test case, a is a string equal to the second input, ans is the number of substrings of a with length 3 that are either 'map' or 'pie', i is equal to the length of a, s is the last substring of a with length 3, and stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the number of substrings of a with length 3 that are either 'map' or 'pie' which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, a is a string, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i is equal to the length of a, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the (i-3)th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a which is ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
