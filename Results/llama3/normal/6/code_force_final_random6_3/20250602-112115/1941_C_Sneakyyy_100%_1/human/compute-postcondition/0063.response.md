Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i is equal to the length of a, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the (i-3)th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the integer n remains unchanged, the string a remains unchanged, the variable ans is equal to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string a, the variable i is equal to the length of the string a, the variable s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the (i-3)th index, and the standard input contains t-3 test cases.
