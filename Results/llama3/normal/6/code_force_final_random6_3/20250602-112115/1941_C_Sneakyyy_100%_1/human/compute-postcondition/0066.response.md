Output State: **stdin is empty, n is an integer, a is a string, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i is equal to the length of a, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the (i-3)th index, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a which is ans is being printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the input buffer (stdin) will be empty because all test cases have been processed. The variables n, a, ans, i, and s will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, n will be an integer, a will be a string, ans will be the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i will be equal to the length of a, and s will be a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the (i-3)th index. Additionally, the value of ans will be printed as output.
