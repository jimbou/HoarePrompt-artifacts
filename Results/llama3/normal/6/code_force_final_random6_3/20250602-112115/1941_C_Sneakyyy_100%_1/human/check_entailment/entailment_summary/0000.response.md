Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It iterates through the string, checking for non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie', and increments the count whenever such a substring is found. The count is then printed for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') or when the string contains overlapping occurrences of the substrings.

Correctness: **True**
