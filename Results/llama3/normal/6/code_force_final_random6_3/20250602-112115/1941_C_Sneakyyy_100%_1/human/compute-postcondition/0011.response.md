Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a has at least 4 characters if the original i was 1 or at least 5 characters if the original i was 3, s is a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, i is 4 if the original i was 1 or 6 if the original i was 3, ans is 1 if the original s was 'map' or 'pie' or 1 if the original s was neither 'map' nor 'pie', stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The length of string `a` is still at least 4 characters if the original `i` was 1 or at least 5 characters if the original `i` was 3. The substring `s` of `a` now starts at the updated index `i` with a length of 3. The value of `i` has been incremented by 3, so it is now 4 if it was originally 1 or 6 if it was originally 3. The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1 if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', or 1 if the original `s` was neither 'map' nor 'pie'. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-1` test cases.
