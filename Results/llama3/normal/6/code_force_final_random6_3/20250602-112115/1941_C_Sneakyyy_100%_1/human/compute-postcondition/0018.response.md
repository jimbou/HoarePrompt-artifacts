Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 7 or 9 or 5 or 4 characters, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 or 2 and `i` is 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 or 1 and `i` is 1, 2, 3, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.***
