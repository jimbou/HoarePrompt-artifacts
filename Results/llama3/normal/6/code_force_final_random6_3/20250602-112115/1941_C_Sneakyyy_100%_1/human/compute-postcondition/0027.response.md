Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first test case, a is a string equal to the second input and its length is at least 3, ans is 1, i is 3, s is a substring of a with length 3 starting at index 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of s is either 'map' or 'pie'.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3 and the value of `ans` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the first test case. The value of `a` also remains unchanged as the second input. The length of `a` is still at least 3. The value of `s` is still a substring of `a` with length 3 starting at index 0, and its current value is either 'map' or 'pie'. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
