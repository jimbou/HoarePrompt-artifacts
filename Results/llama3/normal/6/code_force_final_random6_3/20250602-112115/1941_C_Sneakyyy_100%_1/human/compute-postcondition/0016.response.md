Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a has at least 7 or 9 or 5 or 4 characters, s is a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, i is 7 or 9 or 5 or 3, ans is 2 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise ans is 1, and s is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3 and adds 1 to the value of `ans`. Since `i` was initially 4 or 6, it becomes 7 or 9. Since `ans` was initially 1 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie', it becomes 2; otherwise, it was 0 and becomes 1. The values of `stdin`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
