Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the string contains "mapie" or "mapie" with any number of 'p's in between. In such cases, the program will count it as two separate occurrences of "map" and "pie", whereas it should be counted as only one occurrence.

For example, if the input string is "mappppie", the program will output 2, whereas the correct output should be 1.
