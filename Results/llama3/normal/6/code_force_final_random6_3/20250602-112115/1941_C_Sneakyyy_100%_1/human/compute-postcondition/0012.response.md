Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` has at least 4 characters if `i` is 2 or at least 5 characters if `i` is 4, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` with length 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 4. The length of string `a` is still at least 4 characters if `i` is 2 or at least 5 characters if `i` is 4. The substring `s` is still of length 3, but its starting index is now `i-1`. The values of `n`, `ans`, and the condition on `s` remain the same.
