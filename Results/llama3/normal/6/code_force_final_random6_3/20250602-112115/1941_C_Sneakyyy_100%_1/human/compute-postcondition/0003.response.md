Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 0 with length 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is now a substring of `a` starting at index 0 with a length of 3 characters. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
