Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 3 if i was 1, and a length of at least 5 if i was 3, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the ith index, i is i+3, ans is ans+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If s was either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6. Otherwise, ans is 1 and i is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The length of string `a` is still at least 3 if `i` was initially 1, and at least 5 if `i` was initially 3. The substring `s` is still a substring of `a` with a length of 3, but its starting index has shifted due to the change in `i`. The value of `i` has increased by 3. The value of `ans` has increased by 1. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, t-3. If `s` was either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is now 2 and `i` is now 6. Otherwise, `ans` is now 1 and `i` is now 4.
