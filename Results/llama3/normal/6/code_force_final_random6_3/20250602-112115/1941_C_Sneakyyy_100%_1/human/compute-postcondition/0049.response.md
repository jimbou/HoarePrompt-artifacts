Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 3, ans is 1, i is 3, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the 0th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. The current value of s is either 'map' or 'pie'.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3 and the value of `ans` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The string `a` and its substring `s` also remain unchanged, with `s` still being either 'map' or 'pie'. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, with t-3 test cases still present.
