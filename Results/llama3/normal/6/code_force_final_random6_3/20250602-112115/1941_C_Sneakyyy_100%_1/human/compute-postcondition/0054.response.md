Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3 if `i` is 1, and a length of at least 5 if `i` is 3, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`th index. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The length of `a` is still dependent on the value of `i`, and the value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `s`. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same.
