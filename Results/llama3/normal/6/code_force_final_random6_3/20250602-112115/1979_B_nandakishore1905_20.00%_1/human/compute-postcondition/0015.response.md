The code prints the difference between k and q.
k is the absolute difference between n and m, where n and m are non-negative integers.
q is 2 to the power of p-1, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.
Output: **k - 2^(p-1) (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k)**
