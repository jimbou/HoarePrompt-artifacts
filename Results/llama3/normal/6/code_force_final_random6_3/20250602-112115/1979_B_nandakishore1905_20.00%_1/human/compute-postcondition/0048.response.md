Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, i is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between n and m which is k is a power of 2, then k is printed for each test case. Otherwise, if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed for each test case. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed for each test case. Otherwise, the difference between k and 2 to the power of p-1 is printed for each test case, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input. The values of n, m, and k are the values from the last test case. The value of i is equal to the number of test cases. The input (stdin) is empty because all test cases have been processed. The output is a series of printed values, one for each test case, which are either the absolute difference between n and m (if it's a power of 2), 1 (if n is 0 and m is odd), 2 (if n is 0 and m is even), or the difference between the absolute difference and 2 to the power of p-1 (if none of the above conditions are met).
