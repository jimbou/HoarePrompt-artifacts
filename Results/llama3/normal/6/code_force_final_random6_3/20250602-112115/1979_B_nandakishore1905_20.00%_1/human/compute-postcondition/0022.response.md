Based on the precondition, we know that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which means `k` is the result of the expression `abs(n - m)`.

When the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **the absolute difference between n and m**
