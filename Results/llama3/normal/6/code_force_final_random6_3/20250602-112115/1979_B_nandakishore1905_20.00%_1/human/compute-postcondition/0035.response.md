Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The absolute difference between `n` and `m` is then calculated and assigned to `k`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2. The stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus two, as two inputs have been read.
