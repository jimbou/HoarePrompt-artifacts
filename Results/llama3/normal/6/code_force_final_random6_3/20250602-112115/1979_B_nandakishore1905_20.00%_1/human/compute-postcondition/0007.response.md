Based on the precondition, the value of `n` is 0, `m` is an odd non-negative integer, `k` is equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m` which is equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus one. Additionally, `k` is not a power of 2.

The print statement simply prints the value 1.

Output: **1**
