Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and prints a value based on the following conditions: if the absolute difference is a power of 2, it prints the absolute difference; if the first integer is 0 and the second integer is odd, it prints 1; if the first integer is 0 and the second integer is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints the difference between the absolute difference and 2 to the power of the number of digits in the binary representation of the absolute difference minus 1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
