Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two, l is a string of binary digits representing k, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1.**

The code first converts the absolute difference between n and m, k, to a binary string and assigns it to l. The length of this binary string is then calculated and assigned to p. Finally, q is calculated as 2 to the power of p-1. The values of n, m, k, and i remain unchanged, and stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus two.
