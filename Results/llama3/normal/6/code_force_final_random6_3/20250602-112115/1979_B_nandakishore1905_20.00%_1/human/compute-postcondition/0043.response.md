The code prints the difference between the absolute difference between n and m (k) and 2 to the power of p-1 (q), where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k (l).
Output: **k - 2^(p-1) (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k)**
