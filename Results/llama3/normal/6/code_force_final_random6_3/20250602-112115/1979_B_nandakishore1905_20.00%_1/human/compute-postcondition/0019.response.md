Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one. If k is a power of 2, k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, then if n is 0 and m is odd, 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number k - q is printed, where q is 2 to the power of p-1, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.***
