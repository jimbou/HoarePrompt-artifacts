The only object in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1 and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two.**
