According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two distinct non-negative integers x and y, separated by a space. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and i is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case. Each test case contains two distinct non-negative integers x and y, separated by a space. `i` is 0**
