Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. The value of `k` is then updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The code does not affect the number of test cases in stdin.
