The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one.**
