The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin, assigns them to `n` and `m`, and then stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one. The second line calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one.**
