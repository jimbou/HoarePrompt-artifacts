The code prints the difference between k and q. Where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and q is 2 to the power of p-1, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.
Output: **n is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus one, l is a string of binary digits representing k, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, and this is printed: k - q (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and q is 2 to the power of p-1, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k)**
