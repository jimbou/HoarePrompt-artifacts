Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus two. If n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, l is a string of binary digits representing k, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, and the difference between k and q is printed.***
