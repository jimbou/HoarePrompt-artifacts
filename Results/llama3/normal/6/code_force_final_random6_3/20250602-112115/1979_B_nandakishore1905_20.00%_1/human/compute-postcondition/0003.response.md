Based on the precondition, we can determine the value of `k` and describe the output as follows:

`k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since `k` is a power of 2, it can be represented as 2^x, where x is a non-negative integer.

When the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the current value of `k`, which is a power of 2.

Output: **a power of 2 (where the power of 2 is the absolute difference between n and m)**
