The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus two and `t` is currently greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique integers, `b` is a set of unique integers, `f` is 1 if `i` is in `a` or `b`, otherwise 0, `m` is `k` // 2 minus 1 if `i` is in `a` but not `b`, otherwise `k` // 2, `n` is `k` // 2 minus 1 if `i` is in `b` but not `a`, otherwise `k` // 2, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `u` is True if `i` is in `a`, otherwise False, `v` is True if `i` is in `b`, otherwise False, stdin contains a series of test cases minus six lines.**
