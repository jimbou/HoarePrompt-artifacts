To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero (since in most programming languages, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context).

Given that `t` is an integer, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be adjusted to be non-zero.

State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one line with a single integer**
