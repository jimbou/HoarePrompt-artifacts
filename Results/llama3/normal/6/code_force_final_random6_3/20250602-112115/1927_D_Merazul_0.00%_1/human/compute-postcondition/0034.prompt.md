Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one line with a single integer
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    *_, k = R()
    a = {*R()}
    b = {*R()}
    f = 1
    m = n = k // 2
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        u = i in a
        v = i in b
        f &= u | v
        m -= u & ~v
        n -= ~u & v
    print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-zero integer minus one, stdin contains a series of test cases minus three lines, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if any integer from 1 to k is in a or b (or both), otherwise f is 0, m is k // 2 minus the number of integers from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, n is k // 2 minus the number of integers from 1 to k that are not in a and are in b, k is an integer, i is k, and 'Y' is printed if f is 0 and m and n are both non-negative, 'N' is printed if f is 1 or either m or n is negative, 'E' is printed if f is 0 and either m or n is negative, 'O' is printed if f is 0 and both m and n are non-negative, and 'S' is printed if f is 1 and both m and n are non-negative
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a non-zero integer minus two and t is currently greater than 0, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a but not b, otherwise k // 2, n is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b but not a, otherwise k // 2, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is k, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, stdin contains a series of test cases minus six lines, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed. The printed string will be 'Y' if f is 1 and both m and n are greater than or equal to 0, 'N' if f is 0 or either m or n is less than 0, 'E' if f is 1 and either m or n is less than 0, 'O' if f is 0 and both m and n are greater than or equal to 0, and 'S' if f is 1 and both m and n are greater than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a non-zero integer minus three and t is currently greater than 0, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, n is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is k, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, stdin contains a series of test cases minus nine lines, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed, where 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is 'Y' if f is 1 and m and n are both non-negative, 'N' if f is 0 or either m or n is negative, 'E' if f is 1 and either m or n is negative, 'O' if f is 0 and both m and n are non-negative, 'S' if f is 1 and both m and n are non-negative, and the value of f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, the value of m is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, the value of n is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
