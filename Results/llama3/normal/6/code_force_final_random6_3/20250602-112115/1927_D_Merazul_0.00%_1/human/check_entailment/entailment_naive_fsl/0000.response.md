Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array a contains duplicate elements. In this case, the program may not correctly identify the pair of different elements among a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

The program should output:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

However, the program may not correctly identify the pair of different elements in the first query, and may output incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
