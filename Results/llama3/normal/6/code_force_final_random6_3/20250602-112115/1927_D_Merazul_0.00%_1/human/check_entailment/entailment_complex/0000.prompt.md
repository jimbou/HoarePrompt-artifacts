Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains a line with a single integer n, a line with n space-separated integers, a line with a single integer q, and q lines with two space-separated integers each. All integers are in the range [1, 2*10^5] and the sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        *_, k = R()
        
        a = {*R()}
        
        b = {*R()}
        
        f = 1
        
        m = n = k // 2
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin contains an empty series of test cases, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, n is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is k, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a set of integers and a set of queries. It then checks if all integers from 1 to k are present in either of the sets, and if the difference between the number of integers in the first set and the number of integers in the second set is within a certain range. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
