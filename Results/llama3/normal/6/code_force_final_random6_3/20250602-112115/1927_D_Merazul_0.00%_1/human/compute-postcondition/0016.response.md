The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k. If i is less than k + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, k is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again k must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a non-zero integer minus two and t is currently greater than 0, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if i is in a or b, otherwise 0, m is k // 2 minus 1 if i is in a but not b, otherwise k // 2, n is k // 2 minus 1 if i is in b but not a, otherwise k // 2, k is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains a series of test cases minus six lines.**
