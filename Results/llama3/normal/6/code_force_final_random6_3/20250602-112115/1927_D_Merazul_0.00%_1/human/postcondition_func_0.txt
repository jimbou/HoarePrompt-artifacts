This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a set of integers and a set of queries. It then checks if all integers from 1 to k are present in either of the sets, and if the difference between the number of integers in the first set and the number of integers in the second set is within a certain range. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
