The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than 3.
State: **t is a non-zero integer minus one, stdin contains a series of test cases minus three lines, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if either 1 is in a or 1 is in b (or both), otherwise f is 0, m is k // 2 minus 1 if 1 is in a and 1 is not in b, otherwise m is k // 2, n is k // 2 minus 1 if 1 is not in a and 1 is in b, otherwise n is k // 2, k is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, u is 1 if 2 is in a, otherwise u is 0, v is 1 if 2 is in b, otherwise v is 0**
