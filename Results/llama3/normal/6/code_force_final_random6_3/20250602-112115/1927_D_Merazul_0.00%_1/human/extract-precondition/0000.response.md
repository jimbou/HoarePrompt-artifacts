Precondition: **stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains a line with a single integer n, a line with n space-separated integers, a line with a single integer q, and q lines with two space-separated integers each. All integers are in the range [1, 2*10^5] and the sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**
