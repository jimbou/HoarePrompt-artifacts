Output: **t is a non-zero integer minus three and t is currently greater than 0, a is a set of unique integers, b is a set of unique integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, n is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is k, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, stdin contains a series of test cases minus nine lines, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed, where 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is 'Y' if f is 1 and m and n are both non-negative, 'N' if f is 0 or either m or n is negative, 'E' if f is 1 and either m or n is negative, 'O' if f is 0 and both m and n are non-negative, 'S' if f is 1 and both m and n are non-negative, and the value of f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, the value of m is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, the value of n is k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2**
