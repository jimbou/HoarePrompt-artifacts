Output State: **a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is an integer and is equal to the value at index s in list p, k is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, and vis is a list of n integers where the value at index s is 1 and all other values remain the same as their original values.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has changed to the value at index `s` in list `p`, and the value of `k` has decreased by 1. The value of `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times the value at index `s` in list `a`. The value of `cur` has increased by the value at index `s` in list `a`. The value of `vis` at index `s` has been changed to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
