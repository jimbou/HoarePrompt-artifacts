Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha. The game involves two players starting at different positions in a permutation and moving simultaneously for a certain number of turns. The player with the higher score at the end of the game wins.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It then reads the permutation and the array of scores.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position and playing for a certain number of turns. This function uses a greedy approach, always choosing the move that maximizes the score.

The program then calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, passing their starting positions and the duration of the game as arguments. It compares the scores returned by `func_1` and prints the winner of the game.

The program correctly implements the game logic and the greedy approach to maximize the score. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation of `func_1`. The function uses a `vis` array to keep track of visited positions, but it does not handle the case where the game duration `k` is greater than the length of the permutation. In such cases, the function will enter an infinite loop.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that `k` does not exceed the length of the permutation. If `k` is greater than the length of the permutation, the function should return the maximum score that can be achieved by playing for the remaining turns.

Correctness: **False**
