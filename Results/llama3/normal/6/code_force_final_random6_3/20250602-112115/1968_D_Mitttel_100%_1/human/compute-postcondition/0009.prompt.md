You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is a list of two integers, and k is a non-negative integer. The length of p is equal to the length of a. The length of s is 2. The values in p are between 1 and the length of p (inclusive). The values in s are between 1 and the length of p (inclusive).
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is an integer and is equal to the value at index s in list p, k is 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, and vis is a list of n integers where the value at index s is 1 and all other values remain the same as their original values.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, where cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, k is 0, and the value at index s in list a is an integer in the list of integers a, and the original value of mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, where cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, k is 0, and the value at index s in list a is an integer in the list of integers a, and the original value of mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
