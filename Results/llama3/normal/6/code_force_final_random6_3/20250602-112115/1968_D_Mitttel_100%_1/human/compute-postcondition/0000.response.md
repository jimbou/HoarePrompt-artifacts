Output State: **a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is a list of two integers, k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of n zeros.**

The code initializes four new variables: n, mx, cur, and vis. The value of n is set to the length of p, which is equal to the length of a. The values of mx and cur are set to 0. The vis variable is initialized as a list of n zeros, where n is the length of p. The initial state of a, p, s, and k remains unchanged.
