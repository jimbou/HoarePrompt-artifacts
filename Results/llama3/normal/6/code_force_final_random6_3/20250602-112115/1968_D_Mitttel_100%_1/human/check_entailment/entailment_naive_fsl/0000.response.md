Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum score a player can get by either staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation. However, the current implementation only considers the case where the player stays at the current position, and does not consider the case where the player moves to the next position.

For example, consider the case where the permutation is `[2, 3, 1]`, the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the starting position is `1`. The function `func_1` will return `3`, which is the score if the player stays at position `1` for all `k` turns. However, the player can actually get a higher score by moving to position `2` and then staying at position `2` for the remaining `k-1` turns, which would give a score of `2 + (k-1) * 3`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic, and the correctness is **False**.
