Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the problem description.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. It then calls the function `func_1` twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position, to calculate the maximum score each player can achieve.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve. It iterates through the permutation `p` starting from the given starting position `s`, and at each step, it updates the maximum score `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of the current score `cur` and the remaining `k` times the value at the current index in the array `a`. The function returns the maximum score `mx` obtained during this traversal.

The main program then compares the maximum scores obtained by Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
