To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `vis`, `s`, and `k` since these are the variables in the loop head.

1. `vis[s]`: Currently, the value at index `s` in `vis` is 1, which means the loop condition `not vis[s]` is False. To make the loop execute again, we need to adjust `vis[s]` to be 0.

2. `s`: The value of `s` is equal to the value at index `s` in list `p`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we don't need to adjust `s` because its value is not directly affecting the loop condition.

3. `k`: The value of `k` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value. To make the loop execute again, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers, `s` is an integer and is equal to the value at index `s` in list `p`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times the value at index `s` in list `a`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the value at index `s` in list `a`, and `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `s` is 0 and all other values remain the same as their original values.**
