To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `vis` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `vis[s]` is 1, which means it does not satisfy the condition `not vis[s]`. Therefore, we need to adjust `vis[s]` to 0.

Additionally, `k` is one less than its original value, which means it has been decremented. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers, `s` is an integer and is equal to the value at index `s` in list `p`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times the value at index `s` in list `a`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the value at index `s` in list `a`, and `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `s` is 0 and all other values remain the same as their original values.**
