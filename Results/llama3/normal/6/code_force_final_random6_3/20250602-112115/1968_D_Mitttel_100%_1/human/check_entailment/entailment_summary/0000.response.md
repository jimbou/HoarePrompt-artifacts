Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by a player starting from a given position. This function iterates through the permutation `p` and keeps track of the maximum score that can be obtained by adding the current value in `a` and the remaining `k` times the value at the current index. The program then compares the maximum scores obtained by Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
