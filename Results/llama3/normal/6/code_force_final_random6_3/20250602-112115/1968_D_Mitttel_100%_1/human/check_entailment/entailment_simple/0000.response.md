Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. It then calls the function `func_1` twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position, to calculate their respective scores.

The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting from a given position. It does this by simulating the game and keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved at each step.

The program then compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts for k turns, and the players can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation.

The program also correctly handles the case where the players start at different positions and have different scores.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
