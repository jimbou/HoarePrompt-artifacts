Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is a list of two integers, k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is an integer and is equal to the value at index s in list p, k is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, and vis is a list of n integers where the value at index s is 1 and all other values remain the same as their original values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is an integer and is equal to the value at index s in list p, k is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, and vis is a list of n integers where the value at index s is 1 and all other values remain the same as their original values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is an integer and is equal to the value at index s in list p, k is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, and vis is a list of n integers where the value at index s is 1 and all other values remain the same as their original values.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
