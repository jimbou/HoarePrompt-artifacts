To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `not vis[s] and k > 0`.

1. **`not vis[s]`**: This condition requires that the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is not `True` (or not a non-zero value, considering `vis` is a list of zeros). Since `s` is a list of two integers, it cannot directly index `vis` without causing an error. However, assuming `s` is meant to be an index or a single integer value (since it's described as a list of two integers but used as an index), for this condition to be true, `vis[s]` must be 0, which is already the case given that `vis` is a list of n zeros. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `vis` or `s` based on this condition alone.

2. **`k > 0`**: This condition requires that `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is described as a non-negative integer, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

Given these considerations, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute the first time is `k`, which must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of two integers, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, and `vis` is a list of n zeros**
