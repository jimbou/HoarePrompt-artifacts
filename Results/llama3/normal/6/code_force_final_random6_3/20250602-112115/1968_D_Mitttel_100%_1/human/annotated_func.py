#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is a list of two integers, and k is a non-negative integer. The length of p is equal to the length of a. The length of s is 2. The values in p are between 1 and the length of p (inclusive). The values in s are between 1 and the length of p (inclusive).
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: a is a list of integers, p is a list of integers, s is an integer and is equal to the value at index s in list p, k is 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, and vis is a list of n integers where the value at index s is 1 and all other values remain the same as their original values.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a, where cur is the sum of its original value and the value at index s in list a, k is 0, and the value at index s in list a is an integer in the list of integers a, and the original value of mx is the maximum of its original value and the sum of cur plus k times the value at index s in list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a list of integers 'a' based on a given list of indices 'p', a starting index 's', and a non-negative integer 'k'. The function iterates through the list 'a' using the indices in 'p' and keeps track of the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the current value in 'a' and the remaining 'k' times the value at the current index. The function returns the maximum value obtained during this traversal.
