Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `t` inputs: 0 integers, the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has `n` elements, all but the last one are equal, and the last two elements are equal. The variables `l` and `r` are both `n - 2`, and `st` and `end` are both 0. The variable `ans` has been assigned the value `n - 1`. The input stream still contains `t` inputs, but no integers have been read yet. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.
