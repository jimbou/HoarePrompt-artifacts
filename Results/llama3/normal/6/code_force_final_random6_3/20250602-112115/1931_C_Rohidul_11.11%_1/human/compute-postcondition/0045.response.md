Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, the first and last elements of `a` are equal, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 2`, `end` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains t inputs: 0 integers**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The list `a` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, and the first and last elements of `a` are equal. The values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are still `n - 2`. A new variable `ans` is introduced and assigned the value 0, which is the result of subtracting `l` from `r` and then subtracting 1. The stdin still contains t inputs, but they are all 0 integers.
