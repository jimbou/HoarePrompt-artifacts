The variables in the loop head are r and l, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables r and l and a[r] and a[r - 1]. If r is greater than l and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, r is equal to l, l is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1] and a[r] is equal to a[r + 1]. r being equal to l does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to r is greater than l. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, r is greater than l, st is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 2, a[r] is equal to a[r - 1] and a[r] is equal to a[r + 1], stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n)**
