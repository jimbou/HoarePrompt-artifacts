Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, r is n - 2, st is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The rest of the variables (`n`, `a`, `l`, `st`, and the contents of `stdin`) remain unchanged.
