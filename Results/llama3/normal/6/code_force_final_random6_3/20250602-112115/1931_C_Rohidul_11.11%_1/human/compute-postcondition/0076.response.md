Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r, r is equal to l, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is equal to r - l, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. The first and last elements of a are not equal. Either st is not equal to 0, or end is not equal to 0, or a[0] is equal to a[-1].***
