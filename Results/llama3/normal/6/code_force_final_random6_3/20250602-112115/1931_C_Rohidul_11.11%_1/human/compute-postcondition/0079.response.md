Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r, r is equal to l, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is equal to r - l, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is equal to r - l - 1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to 0, end is equal to 0, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then ans is equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans is equal to 0.**
