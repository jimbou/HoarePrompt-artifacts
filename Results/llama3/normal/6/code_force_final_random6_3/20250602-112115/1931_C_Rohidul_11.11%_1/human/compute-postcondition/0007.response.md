Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where a[0] equals a[1] and a[1] equals a[2] and a[2] equals a[3], l is 3, r is greater than 2, st is 3, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

The code increments the value of `l` by 1, making it 3, and the value of `st` by 1, making it 3. No other variables are affected. The values of `n`, `a`, `r`, and `end` remain the same. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged.
