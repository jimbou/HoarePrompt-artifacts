Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where a[0] equals a[1] and a[1] equals a[2], l is 2, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

In this final state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 2, and the value of `st` has also been incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `r`, and `end` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations were performed.
