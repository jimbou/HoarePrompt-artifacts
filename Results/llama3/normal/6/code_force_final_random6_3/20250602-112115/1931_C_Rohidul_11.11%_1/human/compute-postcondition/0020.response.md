Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, `l` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `r` is equal to `l`, `st` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `end` is equal to `n - l - 1`, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) and then `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= `n`), the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, the current value of `st` is 0, the current value of `end` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables and conditions from the initial state remain the same, except that a new variable `ans` is introduced and assigned the value of `n - 1`, which is the length of the list `a` minus 1.
