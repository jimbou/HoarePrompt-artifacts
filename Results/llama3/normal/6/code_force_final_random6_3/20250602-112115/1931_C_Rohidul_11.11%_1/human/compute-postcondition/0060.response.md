Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r - 1, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 1, end is 0, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.**

The code increments `l` by 1 and `st` by 1. The value of `l` is now less than `r - 1` and the value of `st` is now 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
