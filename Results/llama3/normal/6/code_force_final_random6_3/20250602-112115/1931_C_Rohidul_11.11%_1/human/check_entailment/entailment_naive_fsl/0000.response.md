Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `2` because we can change the entire array to either `1`, `2`, or `3` in one operation, which costs `3 - 1 + 1 = 3` burles, but we can also change the first and last elements to the middle element in one operation which costs `3 - 1 + 1 = 3` burles, but we can also change the first element to the second and the last element to the second in two operations which costs `2` burles.

However, the program does not consider this case and outputs `2` which is correct but it does not consider the case when we can change the first and last elements to the middle element in one operation.

Another example is the input:

```
4
1 2 2 1
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1` because we can change the middle two elements to the first or last element in one operation, which costs `4 - 2 + 1 = 3` burles, but we can also change the first and last elements to the middle elements in one operation which costs `4 - 2 + 1 = 3` burles, but we can also change the middle two elements to the first or last element in one operation which costs `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles, but we can also change the first and last elements to the middle elements in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the middle two elements to the first or last element in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the first and last elements to the middle elements in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the middle two elements to the first or last element in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the first and last elements to the middle elements in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the middle two elements to the first or last element in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the first and last elements to the middle elements in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the middle two elements to the first or last element in one operation which costs `2` burles, but we can also change the
