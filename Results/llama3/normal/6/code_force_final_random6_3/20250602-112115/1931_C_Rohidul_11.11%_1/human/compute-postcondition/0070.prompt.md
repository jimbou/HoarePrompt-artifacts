Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r, r is n - 1, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 0, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r, r is n - 2, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 1, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than n - 2, r is less than n - 2, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 2, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 2, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than n - 2, r is less than n - 2 and greater than l, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 3, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 3, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0. a[r] is equal to a[r - 1].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
