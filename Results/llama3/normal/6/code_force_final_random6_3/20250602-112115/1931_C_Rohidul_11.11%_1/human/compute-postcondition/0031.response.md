Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first two elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: n - 2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_(n-2)**

The code increments `l` by 1, making it equal to 1, and increments `st` by 1, making it equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
