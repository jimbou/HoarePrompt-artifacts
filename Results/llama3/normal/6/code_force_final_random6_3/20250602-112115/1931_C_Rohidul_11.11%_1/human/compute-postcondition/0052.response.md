Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is n - 2, r is n - 2, st is n - 2, end is n - 2, stdin contains t inputs: 0 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0.***
