According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r`, `l`, and `a`. If `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is less than `r`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` (because the last two elements of `a` are equal). For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`. Since `r` is `n - 2`, `l` must be less than `n - 2`. Also, since the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, and the first `n - 1` elements of `a` are equal, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` if and only if `r` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `r` must be less than `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than n - 2, r is less than n - 1, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 1, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.**
