Output: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, r is equal to l, st is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is equal to n - l - 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is equal to -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans is equal to 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is either 0 or n - 1 depending on the values of st, end, and the first and last elements of a*
