According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and `a`. If `l` is less than `r` and `a[l]` equals `a[l + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, and `a[0]` equals `a[1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `r` and `a[l]` must equal `a[l + 1]`. Since `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 3. Also, since `a[0]` equals `a[1]`, `a[1]` must equal `a[2]` for the loop to execute again.

State: **n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where a[0] equals a[1] and a[1] equals a[2], l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**
