Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 1, end is 0, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, and the value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, with the first `n - 1` elements being equal, and the last two elements being equal. The longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is still less than `n - 1`. The values of `r`, `end`, and `ans` remain the same. The stdin still contains `t - 1` inputs: 1 integers.
