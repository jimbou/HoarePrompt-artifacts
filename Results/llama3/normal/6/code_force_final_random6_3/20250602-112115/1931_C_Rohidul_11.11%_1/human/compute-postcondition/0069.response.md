Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than n - 2, r is less than n - 2 and greater than l, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 3, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 3, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0. a[r] is equal to a[r - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the equality of the first and last elements of `a`, the value of `st`, and the printing of the maximum of 0 and `ans` are still applicable.
