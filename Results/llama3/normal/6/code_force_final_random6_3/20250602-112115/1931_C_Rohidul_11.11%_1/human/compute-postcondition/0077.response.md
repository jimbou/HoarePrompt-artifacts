Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is equal to `l`, `st` is equal to the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `end` is equal to `r - l`, `ans` is equal to 0, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs: 1 integers. The first and last elements of `a` are not equal. Either `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now 0, which is the difference between `r` and `l`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer greater than 1, `a` being a list of `n` integers with the first `n - 1` elements equal and the last two elements equal, `l` being less than `r`, `r` being equal to `l`, `st` being equal to the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, and `end` being equal to `r - l`. The stdin still contains `t - 1` inputs: 1 integers. The first and last elements of `a` are still not equal. Either `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.
