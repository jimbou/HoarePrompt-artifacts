Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 0, end is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: n - 2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_(n-2)**

The code first reads an integer n from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. Then, it reads n integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns this list to the variable a. The variables l and r are initialized to 0 and n - 1, respectively. The variables st and end are also initialized to 0. 

After the execution of the code, the value of n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the value of a is a list of n integers between 1 and n. The longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, and the last two elements of a are equal. The values of l, r, st, and end are 0, n - 1, 0, and 0, respectively. Stdin now contains t - 2 inputs: n - 2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_(n-2).
