Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r, r is n - 1, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 0, ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated until it has found the longest prefix of the list `a` where all elements are equal. The variable `l` is now equal to the length of this prefix, and the variable `st` is also equal to this length. The variable `r` remains at `n - 1`, and the variable `end` remains at `0`. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
