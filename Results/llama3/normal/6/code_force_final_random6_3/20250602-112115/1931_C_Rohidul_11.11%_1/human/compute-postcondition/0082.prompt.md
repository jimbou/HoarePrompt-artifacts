Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t times: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, r is equal to l, st is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is equal to n - l - 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is equal to -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans is equal to 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is either 0 or n - 1 depending on the values of st, end, and the first and last elements of a*

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is n - 2, r is n - 2, st is n - 2, end is n - 2, stdin contains t inputs: 0 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is either 0 or n - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is less than r, r is equal to l, st is equal to the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is equal to r - l, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is equal to r - l - 1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is equal to 0, end is equal to 0, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then ans is equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans is equal to 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
