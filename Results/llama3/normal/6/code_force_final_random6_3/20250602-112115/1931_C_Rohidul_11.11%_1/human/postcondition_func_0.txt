This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates the length of the longest contiguous subarray with equal elements, excluding the first and last elements if they are equal. If the first and last elements are not equal, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray with equal elements, excluding the first element if it is not equal to the last element. The function prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated length for each test case.
