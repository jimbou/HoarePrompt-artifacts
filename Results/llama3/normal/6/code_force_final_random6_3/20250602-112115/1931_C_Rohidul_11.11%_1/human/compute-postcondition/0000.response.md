According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t times: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t times: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), `_` is 0, input() must be at least 1**
