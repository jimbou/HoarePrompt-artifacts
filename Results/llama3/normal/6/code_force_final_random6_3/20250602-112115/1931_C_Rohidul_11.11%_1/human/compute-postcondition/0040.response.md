Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is n - 2, r is n - 2, st is n - 2, end is 2, stdin contains t - 3 inputs: n - 3 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_(n-3)**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it equal to `n - 2`, which is the same value as `l`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `a` and `stdin` remains the same as in the initial state.
