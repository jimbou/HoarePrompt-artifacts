Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first four elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is 3, r is n - 1, st is 3, end is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: n - 2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_(n-2)**

The code increments the value of `l` by 1, making it 3, and the value of `st` by 1, making it 3. No other variables are affected.
