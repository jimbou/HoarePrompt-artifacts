Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first n - 1 elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 0, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: 1 integers. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0, and the maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is either 0 or n - 1**

The code executes as follows:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, this line does not change the fact that `n` is greater than 1.

2. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, and the last two elements of `a` are equal, this line does not change the properties of `a`.

3. `l, r = 0, n - 1`: This line assigns 0 to `l` and `n - 1` to `r`. Since `l` was `n - 2` and `r` was `n - 2`, this line changes the values of `l` and `r`.

4. `st, end = 0, 0`: This line assigns 0 to `st` and 0 to `end`. Since `st` was `n - 2` and `end` was `n - 2`, this line changes the values of `st` and `end`.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is an integer greater than 1.
* `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, and the last two elements of `a` are equal.
* `l` is 0.
* `r` is `n - 1`.
* `st` is 0.
* `end` is 0.
* stdin contains `t - 1` inputs: 1 integers.
* If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is 0. If the first and last elements of `a` are not equal, then if `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `n - 1`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and the maximum of 0 and `ans` is printed, which is either 0 or `n - 1`.
