Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where a[0] equals a[1], l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

The code block increments the value of `l` by 1 and the value of `st` by 1. The initial value of `l` was 0, so it becomes 1. The initial value of `st` was also 0, so it becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `a`, `r`, and `end` remain the same as in the initial state. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.
