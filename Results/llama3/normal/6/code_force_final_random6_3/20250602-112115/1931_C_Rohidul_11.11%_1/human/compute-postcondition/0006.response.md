The variables in the loop head are l, r, and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l, r, and a. If l is less than r and a[l] is equal to a[l + 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is 2, r is n - 1, and a[0] equals a[1] and a[1] equals a[2]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r, so r must be greater than 2. Also, a[l] must be equal to a[l + 1], so a[2] must be equal to a[3]. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where a[0] equals a[1] and a[1] equals a[2] and a[2] equals a[3], l is 2, r is greater than 2, st is 2, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**
