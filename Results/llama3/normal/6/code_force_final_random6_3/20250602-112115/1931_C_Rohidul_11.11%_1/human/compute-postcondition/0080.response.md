The code prints the maximum value between 0 and `ans`. To determine the value of `ans`, we need to consider the conditions described in the initial state.

Since the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, `st` is less than `n - 1`. Also, the last two elements of `a` are equal, so `end` is at least 1.

If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1`. Since `r` is equal to `l`, `ans` is equal to `-1` in this case.

If the first and last elements of `a` are not equal, then we need to consider the values of `st` and `end`. If `st` is equal to 0, `end` is equal to 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `n - 1`.

However, since `st` is less than `n - 1` and the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, `st` cannot be 0. Therefore, this condition is not met.

In all other cases, `ans` is equal to 0.

So, the value of `ans` can be either `-1`, `n - 1`, or 0. Since we are printing the maximum value between 0 and `ans`, the output will be either 0 or `n - 1`.

Output: **0 or n - 1 (where n is the length of the list a)**
