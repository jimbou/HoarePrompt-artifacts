Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` where the first `n - 1` elements are equal, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is equal to `l`, `st` is equal to the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `end` is equal to `r - l`, `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs: 1 integers. The first and last elements of `a` are equal.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been calculated as `r - l - 1`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition that the first and last elements of `a` are equal is still valid. The stdin still contains `t - 1` inputs: 1 integers.
