Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, l is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, r is n - 1, st is the length of the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal, end is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `l` will be equal to the length of the longest prefix of the list `a` where all elements are equal. The variable `st` will also be equal to this length. The variable `r` will remain `n - 1`, and the variable `end` will remain `0`. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body, such as `n` and `a`, will remain unchanged.
