Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n where the first three elements are equal, the longest prefix of a where all elements are equal is less than n - 1, the last two elements of a are equal, l is 2, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: n - 2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_(n-2)**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `st` have been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, with the first three elements being equal and the last two elements being equal. The longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is still less than `n - 1`. The value of `n` is still greater than 1, and the stdin still contains `t - 2` inputs.
