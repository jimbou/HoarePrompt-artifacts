The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`, and also `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `l`, and also `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`. If `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`. `r` being `n - 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `r` is greater than `l`. Also, `a[r]` being equal to `a[r - 1]` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r + 1]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal is less than `n - 1`, the last two elements of `a` are equal, `l` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `r` is greater than `l`, `st` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` where all elements are equal, `end` is 1, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r + 1]`, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) and then `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= `n`).**
