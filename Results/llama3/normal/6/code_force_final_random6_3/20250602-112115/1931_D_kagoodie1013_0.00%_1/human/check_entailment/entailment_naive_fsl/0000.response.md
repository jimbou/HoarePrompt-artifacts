Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it counts the beautiful pairs. The program increments the count by the number of occurrences of the modular inverses of `x` and `y` for each number in the array. However, this approach is incorrect because it counts each pair twice.

For example, consider the input `n = 6, x = 5, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`. The program will count the pair `(1, 9)` twice, once when processing `1` and once when processing `9`. This results in an incorrect count of beautiful pairs.

A correct approach would be to use a single hash map to store the count of numbers modulo `x` and then iterate through the array to find the beautiful pairs. This way, each pair is counted only once.
