Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x and y are the first two integers in the first test case, arr is the list of n integers in the first test case and must have at least n integers, results is a list with one element which is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key equal to the remainder of num divided by x and a value equal to the number of times num divided by x has the remainder mod_x_key, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key equal to the remainder of num divided by y and a value equal to the number of times num divided by y has the remainder mod_y_key, num is the last integer in the first test case, mod_x is equal to the negative remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of results now contains the count of the number of times the remainder of the last integer in the first test case divided by x and y appears in the mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries respectively, plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
