Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x and y are the first two integers in the first test case, arr is the list of n integers in the first test case and must have at least 2 integers, results is an empty list, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key equal to the remainder of num divided by x and a value equal to 1 plus the value of mod_x_map for the key mod_x_key, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key equal to the remainder of num divided by y and a value equal to 1 plus the value of mod_y_map for the key mod_y_key, num is the second integer in the first test case, mod_x is equal to the negative remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by y.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The code executes on the given initial state, modifying the values of certain variables. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, with at least one test case containing an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. The `results` list is still empty.

The `count` variable is updated by adding the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively, to its original value. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries are also updated by incrementing the values for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively.

New variables `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` are introduced, with `mod_x` being the negative remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` being the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x_key` being the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `mod_y_key` being the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

The `num` variable remains unchanged, being the second integer in the first test case.
