Functionality: **This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the negative remainder of each integer divided by x and the remainder of each integer divided by y, and counting the occurrences of these remainders in two separate dictionaries. The function returns a list of results, where each result is the total count of occurrences of the calculated remainders for each test case.**
