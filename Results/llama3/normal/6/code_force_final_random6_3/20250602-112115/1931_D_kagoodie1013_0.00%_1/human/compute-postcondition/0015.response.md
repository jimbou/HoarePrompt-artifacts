To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, and `num` is the last integer in `arr`.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the next integer in `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 1 integer, we can assume that the next integer exists.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 2 test cases, `n` is the number of integers in the second test case, `x` and `y` are the first two integers in the second test case, `arr` is the list of n integers in the second test case and must have at least 2 integers, `results` is a list with one element which is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is mod_x_key and the value is 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is mod_y_key and the value is 1, `num` is the second integer in the first test case, `mod_x` is equal to the negative remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, `mod_x_key` is equal to the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y_key` is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively**
