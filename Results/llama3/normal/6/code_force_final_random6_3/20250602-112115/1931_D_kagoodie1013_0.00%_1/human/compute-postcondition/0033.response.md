Output State: **The program returns a list of results where each result is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively plus the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus the values of `mod_x_map` for the key `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for the key `mod_y`, for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, the program returns a list of results where each result represents the sum of the counts of numbers in the test case that have a certain remainder when divided by `x` and `y`, plus the counts of numbers that have a certain remainder when divided by `x` and `y` in the entire list of test cases. The counts are stored in dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the remainders as keys. The program returns this list of results for each test case in the `test_cases` list.
