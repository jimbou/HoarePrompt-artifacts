Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary to store the count of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and y. It then iterates over the array, for each number, it calculates the remainder when divided by x and y, and checks if the corresponding remainder is present in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is counting the pairs where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y, but it is not considering the condition that i < j. This means that the program is counting each pair twice, once for (i, j) and once for (j, i).

To fix this error, the program should only count the pairs where i < j. This can be done by modifying the program to only increment the count when the remainder of a_i + a_j is divisible by x and the remainder of a_i - a_j is divisible by y, and i < j.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(arr):
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[j] + num) % x == 0 and (arr[j] - num) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

Correctness: **False**
