To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 3 test cases, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, `n` is the number of integers in the second test case, `x` and `y` are the first two integers in the second test case, `arr` is the list of `n` integers in the second test case and must have at least `n` integers.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be updated to the corresponding values in the third test case.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer `n` and two integers `x` and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers, and `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases, `n` is the number of integers in the third test case, `x` and `y` are the first two integers in the third test case, `arr` is the list of `n` integers in the third test case and must have at least `n` integers, `results` is a list with two elements, the first element is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively plus the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus the values of `mod_x_map` for the key `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for the key `mod_y`, and the second element is `count` which is equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively plus the values of `mod_x_map` for the key `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for the key `mod_y` plus the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus the values of `mod_x_map` for the key `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for the key `mod_y`, `num` is the `n`th integer in the second test case, `mod_x` is equal to the negative remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is equal to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is `mod_x_key` and the value is `n`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is `mod_y_key` and the value is `n`.**
