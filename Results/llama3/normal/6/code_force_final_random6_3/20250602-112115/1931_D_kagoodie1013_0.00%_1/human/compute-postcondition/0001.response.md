To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `test_cases` must be a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer `n` and two integers `x` and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one test case.
3. Since `results` is an empty list, it doesn't affect the loop's execution.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the number of integers in the first test case, `x` and `y` are the first two integers in the first test case, `arr` is the list of n integers in the first test case, `results` is an empty list**
