Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x and y are the first two integers in the first test case, arr is the list of n integers in the first test case and must have at least n integers, results is an empty list, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key equal to the remainder of num divided by x and a value equal to the number of times num divided by x has the remainder mod_x_key, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key equal to the remainder of num divided by y and a value equal to the number of times num divided by y has the remainder mod_y_key, num is the last integer in the first test case, mod_x is equal to the negative remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the integers in the first test case, and the count variable has accumulated the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively, plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y. The mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries have been updated to reflect the number of times each remainder occurs for the integers in the first test case. The num variable is now the last integer in the first test case, and the mod_x, mod_y, mod_x_key, and mod_y_key variables have been updated accordingly.
