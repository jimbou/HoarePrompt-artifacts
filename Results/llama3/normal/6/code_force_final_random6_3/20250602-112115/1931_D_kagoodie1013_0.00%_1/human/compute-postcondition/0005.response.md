To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for num in arr:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which takes on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

According to the state at the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of `n` integers and must have at least 1 integer. Since the loop has already executed once, `num` is currently the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` should be the second integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x and y are the first two integers in the first test case, arr is the list of n integers in the first test case and must have at least 2 integers, results is an empty list, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key equal to the remainder of num divided by x and a value equal to 1, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key equal to the remainder of num divided by y and a value equal to 1, num is the second integer in the first test case**
