Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer `n` and two integers `x` and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers, and `test_cases` must have at least as many test cases as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is the number of integers in the last test case, `x` and `y` are the first two integers in the last test case, `arr` is the list of `n` integers in the last test case and must have at least `n` integers, `results` is a list with as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, each element is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively plus the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus the values of `mod_x_map` for the key `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for the key `mod_y`, `num` is the `n`th integer in the last test case, `mod_x` is equal to the negative remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is equal to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` integers, `num` is the `n`th integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of test cases where each test case has been processed according to the loop's logic. The `results` list contains the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that satisfy the condition specified in the loop. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries contain the counts of numbers in each test case that have a specific remainder when divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The `count` variable contains the total count of pairs of numbers in the last test case that satisfy the condition.
