    #The program returns a list of results where each result is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively plus the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus the values of `mod_x_map` for the key `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for the key `mod_y`, for each test case in `test_cases`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the negative remainder of each integer divided by x and the remainder of each integer divided by y, and counting the occurrences of these remainders in two separate dictionaries. The function returns a list of results, where each result is the total count of occurrences of the calculated remainders for each test case.
