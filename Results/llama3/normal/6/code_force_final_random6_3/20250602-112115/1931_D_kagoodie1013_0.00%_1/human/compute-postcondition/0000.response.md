Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `test_cases` still holds its initial value, which is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers. The code initializes an empty list `results`, which is added to the output state.
