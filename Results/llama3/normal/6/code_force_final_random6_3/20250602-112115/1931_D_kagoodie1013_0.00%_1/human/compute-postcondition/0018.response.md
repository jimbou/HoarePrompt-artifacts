Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 2 test cases, n is the number of integers in the second test case, x and y are the first two integers in the second test case, arr is the list of n integers in the second test case and must have at least 3 integers, results is a list with one element which is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y, mod_x_map is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is mod_x_key and the value is 3, mod_y_map is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is mod_y_key and the value is 3, num is the third integer in the first test case, mod_x is equal to the negative remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is equal to the remainder of num divided by y, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map for the key mod_x and mod_y_map for the key mod_y.**
