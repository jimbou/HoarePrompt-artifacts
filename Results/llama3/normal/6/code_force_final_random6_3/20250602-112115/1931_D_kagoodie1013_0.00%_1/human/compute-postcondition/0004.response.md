Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x and y are the first two integers in the first test case, arr is the list of n integers in the first test case and must have at least 1 integer, results is an empty list, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key equal to the remainder of num divided by x and a value equal to 1, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key equal to the remainder of num divided by y and a value equal to 1, num is the first integer in the first test case.**

The code snippet modifies the count, mod_x_map, and mod_y_map variables. The count variable is incremented by the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively. The mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries are updated with new keys and values. The mod_x_key is set to the remainder of num divided by x, and the mod_x_map dictionary is updated with this key and a value of 1. Similarly, the mod_y_key is set to the remainder of num divided by y, and the mod_y_map dictionary is updated with this key and a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
