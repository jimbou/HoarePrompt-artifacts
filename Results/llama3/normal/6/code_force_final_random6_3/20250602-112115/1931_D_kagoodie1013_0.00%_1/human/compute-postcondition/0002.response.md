Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four elements: an integer n and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, and test_cases must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x and y are the first two integers in the first test case, arr is the list of n integers in the first test case, results is an empty list, count is 0, mod_x_map is an empty dictionary, mod_y_map is an empty dictionary**

The code initializes three new variables: `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map`. The `count` variable is set to 0, and the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` variables are initialized as empty dictionaries. The rest of the variables from the initial state remain unchanged.
