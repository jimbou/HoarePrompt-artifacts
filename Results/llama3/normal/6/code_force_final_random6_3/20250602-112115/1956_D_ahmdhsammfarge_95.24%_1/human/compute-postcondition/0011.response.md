The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `lst`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `lst` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `lst` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 4 elements. If the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst`, then `l` is 0, `r` is 2, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
