To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `lst`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `range(i + 1, len(lst))`, which means the loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.
2. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
3. The loop will iterate over the indices of `lst` starting from `i + 1`, so we need to adjust `j` to be at least `i + 1`.
4. The length of `lst` must be at least `i + 2` to ensure the loop can execute.

The states of `l`, `r`, `over_sum`, and `sm` are not directly related to the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 0, `j` is at least `i + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus the square of the length of `lst`, `lst` has a length of at least `i + 2`**
