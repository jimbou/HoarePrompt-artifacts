Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 0, `j` is at least `i + 3`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least `i + 3`. If the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) is greater than `over_sum`, then `l` is set to `i`, `r` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is set to this sum.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variables `l`, `r`, and `over_sum` are updated based on the new calculation of `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive). If this new sum is greater than the previous maximum sum `over_sum`, then `l` and `r` are updated to `i` and `j`, respectively, and `over_sum` is updated to this new sum. The values of `i`, `j`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
