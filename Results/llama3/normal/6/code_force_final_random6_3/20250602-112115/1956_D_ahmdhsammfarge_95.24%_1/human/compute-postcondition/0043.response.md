Output State: **l is i, r is j, over_sum is sm, i is 1, j is greater than 2, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), lst has a length of at least 3**

The code snippet assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `l` and `r`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of `l`, `r`, and `over_sum`, as well as the unchanged values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `lst`.
