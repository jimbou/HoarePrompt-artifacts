Output State: **r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of non-negative integers where the sublist from index r to l (inclusive) is a list of n identical elements equal to n, where n is equal to l - r + 1, and ops is a list of lists of integers where the last three sublists are [r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], and [r + 1, l + 1].**

The code modifies the `ops` list by appending two new sublists: `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The `func_2(r, l, ops)` function is called, but its effects are not specified, so we cannot determine its impact on the state. The code then calculates `n` as `l - r + 1` and assigns a new sublist to `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive), where all elements are equal to `n`. The original values of `r` and `l` are preserved, and the list `lst` is modified only in the specified range. The list `ops` is extended with the two new sublists.
