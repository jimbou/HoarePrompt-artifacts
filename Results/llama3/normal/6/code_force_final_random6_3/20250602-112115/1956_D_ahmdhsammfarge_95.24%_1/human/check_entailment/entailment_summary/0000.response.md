Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation (replacing a subarray with its MEX) no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. Function 1 (`func_1`) finds the subarray that yields the maximum sum when the sum of its elements is added to the square of its length. This is a crucial step in solving the problem, as it identifies the subarray that needs to be replaced to maximize the sum.

3. Function 2 (`func_2`) is a recursive function that generates a sequence of operations to replace the identified subarray with its MEX. Although the function is not explicitly described in the problem, its execution summary suggests that it generates the necessary operations to achieve the desired replacement.

4. Function 3 (`func_3`) modifies the input list by replacing the specified subarray with its MEX and appends the necessary operations to the list of operations. This function is essential in achieving the desired replacement and updating the list of operations.

5. The main program iteratively calls Function 1 to find the subarray to replace, Function 3 to replace the subarray and update the list of operations, and Function 2 to generate the sequence of operations. The program also handles the case where the input list contains zeros, which requires special handling.

6. The final output of the program is the maximum sum of elements in the array and the list of operations that achieves this sum, which meets the problem's requirements.

In conclusion, the given program is correct, as it accurately implements the necessary steps to solve the problem and meets the problem's requirements.
