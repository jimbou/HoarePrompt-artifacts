Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 4 elements, l is 3, r is 0, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst except the first and last three elements plus 9, i is 0, j is 3, and sm is the sum of all elements in lst except the first and last three elements plus 9.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been swapped, with `l` now being 3 and `r` being 0. The value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9. The values of `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
