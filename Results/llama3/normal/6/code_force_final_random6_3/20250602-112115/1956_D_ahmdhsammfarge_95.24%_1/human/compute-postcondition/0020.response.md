Output State: **l is i, r is j, over_sum is sm, i is 0, j is at least i + 1, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), lst has a length of at least i + 2**

The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `l` and `r`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is greater than `over_sum` initially, `over_sum` becomes equal to `sm`. The values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
