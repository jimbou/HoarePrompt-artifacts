Output State: **l is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, r is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, over_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray, i is 1, j is equal to the last index of lst, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), lst has a length of at least 3.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `l`, `r`, and `over_sum` will hold the index of the first element, the index of the last element, and the maximum sum of the subarray with the maximum sum, respectively. The variable `i` will still be 1, and the variable `j` will be equal to the last index of the list `lst`. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive). The list `lst` will still have a length of at least 3.
