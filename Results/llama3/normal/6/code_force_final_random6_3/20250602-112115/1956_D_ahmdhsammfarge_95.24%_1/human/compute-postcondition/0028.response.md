Output State: **l is i, r is j, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), i is 0, j is at least i + 3, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), lst has a length of at least i + 3.**

The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `l` and `r`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `over_sum` becomes this sum. The values of `i`, `j`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
