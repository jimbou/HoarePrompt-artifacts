The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the list `lst`. If `j` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than 1 and `lst` has a length of at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `lst` must have a length of at least 3.
State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least 3**
