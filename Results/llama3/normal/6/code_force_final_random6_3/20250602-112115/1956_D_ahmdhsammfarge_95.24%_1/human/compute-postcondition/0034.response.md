Postcondition: ***`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `i`, `lst` has a length of at least 3. The current value of `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), and it is greater than the current value of `over_sum`***
