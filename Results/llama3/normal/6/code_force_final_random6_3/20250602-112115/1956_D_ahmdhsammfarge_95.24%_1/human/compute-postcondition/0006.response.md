Functionality: **This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by replacing a specified sublist with a new sublist containing identical elements equal to the length of the original sublist. It takes three parameters: the start and end indices of the sublist to be replaced, and a list of operations. The function appends certain operations to the list of operations and calls another function, func_2, before modifying the original list. The modified list is then returned.**
