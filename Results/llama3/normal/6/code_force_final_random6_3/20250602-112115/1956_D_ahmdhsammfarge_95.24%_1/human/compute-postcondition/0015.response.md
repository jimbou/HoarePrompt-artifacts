Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `lst`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus the square of the length of `lst`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have `l` and `r` set to the indices of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` set to the maximum sum of a subarray, and `i` and `j` set to 0 and the last index of `lst`, respectively. The value of `sm` will be the sum of all elements in `lst` plus the square of the length of `lst`.
