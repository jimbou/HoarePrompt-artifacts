Output State: **l is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, r is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, over_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray, i is equal to the last index of lst, j is equal to the last index of lst, sm is the sum of all elements in lst plus the square of the length of lst, lst has a length of at least the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables l and r will hold the indices of the subarray with the maximum sum, over_sum will hold the maximum sum of a subarray, i and j will be equal to the last index of the list lst, sm will be the sum of all elements in lst plus the square of the length of lst, and lst will have a length of at least the number of iterations of the loop.
