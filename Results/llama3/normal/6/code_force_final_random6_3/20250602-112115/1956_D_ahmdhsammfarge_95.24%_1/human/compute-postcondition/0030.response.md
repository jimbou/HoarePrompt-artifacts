Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the last index of `lst`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least `i + 2`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `l` is set to `i`, `r` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, the values of `l`, `r`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible subarrays of `lst` starting from index `i` and ending at index `j`, and has updated the values of `l`, `r`, and `over_sum` accordingly. The final values of `l`, `r`, and `over_sum` represent the subarray with the maximum sum, and the sum of this subarray, respectively.
