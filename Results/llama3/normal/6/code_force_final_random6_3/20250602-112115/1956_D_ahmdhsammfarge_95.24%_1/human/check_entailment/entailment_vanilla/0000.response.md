Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(lst)`: This function finds the optimal subarray to perform the operation on. It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray. It keeps track of the subarray that results in the maximum sum.

2. `func_2(r, l, ops)`: This function generates the sequence of operations to transform the subarray from `r` to `l` into a subarray of the same length filled with the MEX. It does this by recursively calling itself to fill the subarray from `r` to `l-1`, then appending the operation to set the element at `l` to the MEX, and finally filling the subarray from `r` to `l-1` again.

3. `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`: This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and generates the sequence of operations. It first appends the operation to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX. If the minimum element in the subarray is 0, it appends another operation to set all elements to the MEX. Then it calls `func_2` to fill the subarray with the MEX and appends the final operation to set all elements to the MEX.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of elements in the array by performing the specified operation. It finds the optimal subarray to perform the operation on, generates the sequence of operations to transform the subarray, and performs the operation.

Correctness: **True**
