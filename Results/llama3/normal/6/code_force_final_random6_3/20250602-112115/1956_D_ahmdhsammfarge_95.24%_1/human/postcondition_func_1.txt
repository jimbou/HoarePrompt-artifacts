This function modifies the input list `ops` by appending new lists of integers based on the input integers `r` and `l`. If `r` is equal to `l`, it appends a list containing `r + 1` and `l + 1` to `ops`. If `r` is less than `l`, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends a list containing `r + 1` and `l + 1` to `ops` twice. The function does not return any value.
