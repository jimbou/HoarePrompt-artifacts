Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is `over_sum` + (2 - 0 + 1) ** 2**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to be the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst`, the sum of the elements of `lst` after index `j`, and the square of the number of elements between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
