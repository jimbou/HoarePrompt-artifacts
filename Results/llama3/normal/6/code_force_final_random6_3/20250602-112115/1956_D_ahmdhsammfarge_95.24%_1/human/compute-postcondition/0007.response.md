According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `lst`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `lst` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `lst` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is `over_sum` + 4**
