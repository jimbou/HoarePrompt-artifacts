To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is: `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum
- `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum
- `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray
- `i` is 1
- `j` is greater than `i`
- `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive)
- `lst` has a length of at least 3

Since the loop head only involves `j`, `i`, and `lst`, we can only adjust the states of these variables.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`. Since `j` is greater than `i` and `i` is 1, we can increment `j` by 1 to satisfy this condition.

The state of `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `lst` remains unchanged because its length is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables (`l`, `r`, `over_sum`, and `sm`) are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than 1, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least 3**
