Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to maximize the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation on subarrays. The operation involves replacing all elements in a subarray with the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray, which is known as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) of the subarray.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. 

func_1 finds the subarray within the given list of non-negative integers that yields the maximum sum when the sum of the subarray's elements is added to the square of the subarray's length. It returns the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray.

func_2 modifies the input list `ops` by appending new lists of integers based on the input integers `r` and `l`. If `r` is equal to `l`, it appends a list containing `r + 1` and `l + 1` to `ops`. If `r` is less than `l`, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends a list containing `r + 1` and `l + 1` to `ops` twice.

func_3 modifies a list of non-negative integers by replacing a specified sublist with a new sublist containing identical elements equal to the length of the original sublist. It takes three parameters: the start and end indices of the sublist to be replaced, and a list of operations. The function appends certain operations to the list of operations and calls func_2 before modifying the original list. The modified list is then returned.

The main part of the program iteratively calls func_1 to find the subarray with the maximum sum, and then calls func_3 to replace this subarray with a new sublist containing identical elements equal to the length of the original sublist. This process continues until no more subarrays can be found that yield a higher sum.

After the iterative process, the program tries to find any remaining zeros in the list and replaces them with ones, appending the corresponding operations to the list of operations.

Finally, the program prints the maximum sum of elements in the array and the number of operations performed, followed by the operations themselves.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the required operations to maximize the sum of elements in the array, and it does so within the allowed number of operations (5 * 10^5).

Correctness: **True**
