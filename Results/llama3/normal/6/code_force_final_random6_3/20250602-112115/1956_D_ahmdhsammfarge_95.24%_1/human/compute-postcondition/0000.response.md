Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last sublist is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `lst` is still a list of non-negative integers. However, the `ops` list has been updated by appending a new sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`. This means that the last element of `ops` is now a list containing the values of `r + 1` and `l + 1`.
