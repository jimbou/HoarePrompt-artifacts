Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, l is 0, r is 0, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst, i is 0, j is 1, sm is over_sum + 4. If sm > over_sum, then l is i, r is j, over_sum is sm, lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 0, j is 1, sm is over_sum + 4 and its current value is higher than over_sum.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements. If the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst`, then `l` is 0, `r` is 2, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 4 elements. If the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3, then `l` is 3, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, `over_sum` are unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
