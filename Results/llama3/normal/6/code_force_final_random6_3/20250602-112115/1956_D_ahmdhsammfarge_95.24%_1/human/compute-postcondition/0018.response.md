Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 0, `j` is at least `i + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least `i + 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to be the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
