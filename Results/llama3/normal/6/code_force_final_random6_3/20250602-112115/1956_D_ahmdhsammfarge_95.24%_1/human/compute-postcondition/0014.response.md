Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 4 elements. If the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3, then `l` is 3, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, `over_sum` are unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9.***
