Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two sublists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The current value of the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends another sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the end of the `ops` list, making the last two sublists of `ops` identical. The other variables `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged, and the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is still 0.
