Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 4 elements. If the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst`, then `l` is 0, `r` is 2, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, `over_sum` are unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated based on the given code. If the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst`, then the values of `l`, `r`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as before. Otherwise, the values of `l`, `r`, and `over_sum` are unchanged, and the values of `i` and `j` are updated to 0 and 3, respectively. The value of `sm` is updated to the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first and last three elements plus 9.
