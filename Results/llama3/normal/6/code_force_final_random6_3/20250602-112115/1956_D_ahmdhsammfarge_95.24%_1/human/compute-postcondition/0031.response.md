To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and the length of `lst` since these are the only variables in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst` has a length of at least `i + 2`, which means `lst` has a length of at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `lst` has a length of at least `i + 2`, the length of `lst` must be at least 3.

State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the last index of `lst`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least 3**
