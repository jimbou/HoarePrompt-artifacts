Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements. If the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3 is greater than the original sum of all elements in `lst`, then `l` is 0, `r` is 2, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
