Postcondition: ***l is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, r is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, over_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray, i is 1, j is greater than 2, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), lst has a length of at least 3. If sm is greater than over_sum, then l is set to i, r is set to j, and over_sum is set to sm. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
