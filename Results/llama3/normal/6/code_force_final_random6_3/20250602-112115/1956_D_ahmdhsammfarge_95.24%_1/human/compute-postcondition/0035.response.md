Output State: **l is i, r is j, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst except those between indices i and j (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices i and j (inclusive), i is 1, j is greater than i, lst has a length of at least 3.**

In this final state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to `i` and `j`, respectively, as a result of the first line of code. The value of `over_sum` has also been updated to the current value of `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive). The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, as do the length of `lst` and the fact that `j` is greater than `i`.
