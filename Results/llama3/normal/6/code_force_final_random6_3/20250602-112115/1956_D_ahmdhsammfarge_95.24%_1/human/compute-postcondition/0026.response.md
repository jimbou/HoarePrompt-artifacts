The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, i and lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `lst`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `i + 2`, `lst` has a length of at least `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and `lst` must have a length of at least `i + 3`. 
State: **`l` is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `r` is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray, `i` is 0, `j` is at least `i + 3`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive) plus the square of the length of the subarray between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive), `lst` has a length of at least `i + 3`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `l` is set to `i`, `r` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is set to `sm`.**
