Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise ans is an empty set, and `q` is undefined.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `temp`, which is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` + `r`) divided by `n` if `c` is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` + `r`) divided by `n` and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` - `r`) divided by `n` if `c` is '?', otherwise `ans` is an empty set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
