Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` was '0' or '?', the previous state of `temp` was a set containing one element which is the remainder of (x + r) divided by n. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
