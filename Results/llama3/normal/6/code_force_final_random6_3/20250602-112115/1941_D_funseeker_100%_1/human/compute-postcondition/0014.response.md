Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`) and the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`). Otherwise, `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`).***
