Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `q` is the third element in ans, `c` is a character, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and possibly the remainder of (q - r) divided by n if `c` is '0' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains only the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if `c` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` may also contain the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, but this is not guaranteed. If `c` is '1', `temp` will only contain the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
