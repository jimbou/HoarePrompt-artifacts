Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one or two elements which are the remainder of (x + r) divided by n and/or the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, in addition to its previous value (if any). The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `q` is equal to `x`, so `(q - r)` is equivalent to `(x - r)`.
