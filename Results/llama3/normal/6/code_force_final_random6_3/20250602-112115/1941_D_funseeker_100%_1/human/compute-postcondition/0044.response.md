Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is at least 3, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, _ is 2, r is an integer, c is a character, q is undefined, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '1' or '?', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0', otherwise ans is an empty set, and temp is an empty set.**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `r, c = func_1().split()`: This line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it returns a string that can be split into two parts. The first part is assigned to `r` and the second part is assigned to `c`.

2. `r = int(r)`: This line converts the value of `r` to an integer. Since `r` was previously assigned a string value, this line changes its type to an integer.

3. `temp = set()`: This line assigns an empty set to `temp`. This line does not affect any other variables.

The final state includes all the information from the initial state that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of the variables that are modified by the code. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `_`, `q`, and `ans` are not affected by the code and retain their initial values. The variable `r` is updated to an integer value, and the variable `c` is updated to a character value. The variable `temp` is assigned an empty set.
