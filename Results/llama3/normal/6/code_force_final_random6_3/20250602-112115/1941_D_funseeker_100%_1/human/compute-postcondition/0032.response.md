Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in ans, `c` is a character, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and either the remainder of (q - r) divided by n or the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, depending on the value of `c`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains both the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n` and the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` now contains only the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`. If `c` is any other character, `temp` remains an empty set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
