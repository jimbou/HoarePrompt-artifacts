Functionality: **This function generates all possible remainders of a sequence of operations on an initial value x, where the operations are either addition or subtraction of a value r, modulo n. The sequence of operations is determined by a string of characters, where '0' indicates addition, '1' indicates subtraction, and '?' indicates both addition and subtraction. The function then prints the number of unique remainders and the remainders themselves in sorted order. If the remainder 0 is present, it is replaced with n.**
