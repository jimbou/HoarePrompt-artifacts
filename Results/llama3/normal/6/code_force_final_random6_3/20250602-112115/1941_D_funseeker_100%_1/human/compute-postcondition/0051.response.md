Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise ans is a non-empty set, `q` is an element in the non-empty set ans, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise temp is an empty set.***
