Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in the non-empty set ans, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise temp is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`, regardless of the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
