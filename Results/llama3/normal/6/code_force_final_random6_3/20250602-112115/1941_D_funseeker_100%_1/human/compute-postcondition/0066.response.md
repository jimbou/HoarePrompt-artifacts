Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing n, _ is m, r is an integer, c is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, q is undefined, temp is an empty set.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line removes the value 0 from the set `ans`, and the second line adds the value `n` to the set `ans`. Since the initial state of `ans` contains 0, the first line removes this value, leaving `ans` empty. The second line then adds the value `n` to `ans`, resulting in `ans` containing only the value `n`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
