Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in ans, `c` is a character, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n if `c` is '0' or '?', otherwise `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if `c` is '1', otherwise `temp` is an empty set.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, in addition to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `temp` now depends on the value of `c`: if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains both the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n` and the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`; if `c` is '1', `temp` contains only the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`; otherwise, `temp` is an empty set.
