Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`) and the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `_`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `q` is still equal to the next element in `ans`. The `temp` set now contains two elements: the original element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`) and the new element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`) that was added by the code.
