Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`), the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`), and the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`). If `c` is '1', `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`), the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`), the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`), and the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`).**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`). The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains at least three elements if `c` is '0' or '?', and at least four elements if `c` is '1'.
