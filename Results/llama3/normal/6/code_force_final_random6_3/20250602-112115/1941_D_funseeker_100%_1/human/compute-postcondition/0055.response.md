Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in the non-empty set ans. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `temp` now contains an additional element, which is the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`. This is because the code adds this new element to the set `temp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
