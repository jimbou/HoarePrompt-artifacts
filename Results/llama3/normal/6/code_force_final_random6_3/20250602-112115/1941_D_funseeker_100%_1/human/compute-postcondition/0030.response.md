Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `q` is an element in ans, and `c` is a character. If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `ans` is an empty set and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if `c` is '0', otherwise `temp` is an empty set.***
