Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least 3 elements, `q` is the third element in the non-empty set ans. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is another character, `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n.***
