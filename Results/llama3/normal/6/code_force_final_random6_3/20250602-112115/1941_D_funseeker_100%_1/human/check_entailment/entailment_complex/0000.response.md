Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the information about the throws, and calculates the possible positions of the ball after the throws. The program handles the cases where the direction of the throw is known ('0' or '1') and the cases where the direction is unknown ('?'). It also correctly handles the case where the remainder is 0, replacing it with n.

The program uses a set to store the possible positions of the ball, which automatically eliminates duplicates. It then prints the number of unique positions and the positions themselves in sorted order.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
