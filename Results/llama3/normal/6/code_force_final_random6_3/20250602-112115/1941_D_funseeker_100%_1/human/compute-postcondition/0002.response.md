Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is at least 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, _ is 0, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls the function `func_1()` and splits its return value into two variables, `r` and `c`. The second line converts the value of `r` to an integer. The third line initializes an empty set `temp`.

The initial state is not modified by the code snippet, so the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `_` remain the same. The code introduces three new variables: `r`, `c`, and `temp`. The value of `r` is an integer, and the value of `c` is a string. The value of `temp` is an empty set.

In summary, the code snippet introduces three new variables and does not modify the initial state. The final state includes the original variables with their unchanged values and the new variables with their assigned values.
