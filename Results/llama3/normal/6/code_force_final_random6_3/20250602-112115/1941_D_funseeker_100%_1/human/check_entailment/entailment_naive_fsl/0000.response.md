Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws. It uses a set to keep track of the possible positions and updates it based on the direction of each throw. The program handles the cases where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The program also correctly handles the case where the position of the ball is 0 by discarding it and adding the total number of players (n) to the set.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and scenarios, including the cases where the direction of the throw is unknown.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and it will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
