The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` + `r`) divided by `n` and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` - `r`) divided by `n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` + `r`) divided by `n` if `c` is '0', otherwise `ans` is an empty set, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `q` is undefined, `temp` is an empty set**
