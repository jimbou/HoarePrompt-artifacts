According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `m` is a non-negative integer, we need to adjust its state to ensure the loop can execute. We also need to adjust the state of the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) to indicate that it will take on the value of the current iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing x, `_` is 0**
