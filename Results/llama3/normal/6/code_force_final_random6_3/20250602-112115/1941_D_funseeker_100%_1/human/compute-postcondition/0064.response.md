Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise ans is an empty set, _ is m, r is an integer, c is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, q is undefined, temp is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `m` remains a non-negative integer.
- `x` remains a positive integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
- The set `ans` contains all possible remainders of the sum of each element in the initial `ans` and `r` divided by `n`, if `c` is '0' or '1'. If `c` is '?', it contains all possible remainders of both the sum and the difference of each element in the initial `ans` and `r` divided by `n`. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `ans` is an empty set.
- The loop counter `_` is equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times.
- `r` is an integer, which is the result of the last execution of `func_1()`.
- `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, which is the result of the last execution of `func_1()`.
- `q` is undefined, as it is only used within the loop.
- `temp` is an empty set, as it is cleared at the end of each iteration.
