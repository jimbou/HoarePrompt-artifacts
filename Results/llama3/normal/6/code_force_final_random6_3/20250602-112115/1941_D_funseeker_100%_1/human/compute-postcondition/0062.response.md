Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is an empty set, `q` is undefined, and `temp` is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise temp is an empty set.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `n`, `m`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `r` and `c` also remain the same. The set `ans` becomes empty, and `q` becomes undefined since it is no longer an element in `ans`. The set `temp` contains all possible remainders of the elements in the initial `ans` added to `r` (if `c` is '0' or '1'), or all possible remainders of the elements in the initial `ans` added to `r` and subtracted by `r` (if `c` is '?'), divided by `n`. If `c` is any other character, `temp` is an empty set.
