Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one or two elements which are the remainder of (x + r) divided by n and/or the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing one element which is the remainder of (x + r) divided by n. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
