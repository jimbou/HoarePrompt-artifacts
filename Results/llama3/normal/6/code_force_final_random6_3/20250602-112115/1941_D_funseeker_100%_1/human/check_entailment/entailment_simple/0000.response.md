Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game and calculates the possible positions of the ball after m throws. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions, which allows it to efficiently handle the case where the direction of a throw is unknown ('?'). The program also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the last position in the circle), by discarding 0 from the set and adding n.

Correctness: **True**
