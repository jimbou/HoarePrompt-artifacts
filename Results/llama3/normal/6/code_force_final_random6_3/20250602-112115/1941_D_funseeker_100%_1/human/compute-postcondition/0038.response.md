Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `q` is the third element in ans, and `c` is a character. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and possibly the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `temp` is an empty set.***
