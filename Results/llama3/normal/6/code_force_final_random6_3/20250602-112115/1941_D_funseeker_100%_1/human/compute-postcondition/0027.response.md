Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '1' or '?', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0', otherwise ans is an empty set, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `q` is an element in ans, `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '?', otherwise temp is an empty set, and `c` is a character***
