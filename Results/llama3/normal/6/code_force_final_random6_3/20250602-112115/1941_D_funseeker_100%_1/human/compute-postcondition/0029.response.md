Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `q` is an element in ans, `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n, and `c` is a character that is either '1' or '?'.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, in addition to the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n` that was already present. The other variables remain unchanged.
