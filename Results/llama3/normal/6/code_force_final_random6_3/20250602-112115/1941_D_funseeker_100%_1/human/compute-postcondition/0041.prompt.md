Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is at least 2, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '1' or '?', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0', otherwise ans is an empty set, _ is 1, r is an integer, q is undefined, temp is an empty set, c is a character
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `q` is an element in ans, and `c` is a character. If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `ans` is an empty set and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if `c` is '0', otherwise `temp` is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in ans, and `c` is a character. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n if `c` is '0' or '?', otherwise `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if `c` is '1'. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `temp` is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `q` is the third element in ans, and `c` is a character. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
