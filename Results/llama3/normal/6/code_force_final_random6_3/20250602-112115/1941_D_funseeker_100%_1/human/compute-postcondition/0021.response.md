Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` + `r`) divided by `n` and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` - `r`) divided by `n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial `ans` + `r`) divided by `n` if `c` is '0', otherwise `ans` is an empty set, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is undefined, `temp` is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `temp`, which depends on the value of `c`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` now contains all possible remainders of adding or subtracting `r` from each element in the initial `ans`, divided by `n`. If `c` is '0', `ans` contains all possible remainders of adding `r` to each element in the initial `ans`, divided by `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is an empty set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
