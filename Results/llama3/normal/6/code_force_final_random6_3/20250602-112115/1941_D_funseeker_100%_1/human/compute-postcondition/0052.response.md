The only variable in the loop head is variable  q and set ans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set ans.  If the set ans has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, ans is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise ans is a non-empty set, q is an element in the non-empty set ans. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set ans must have at least 2 elements and the q is the second element in the set ans.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in the non-empty set ans, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise temp is an empty set.**
