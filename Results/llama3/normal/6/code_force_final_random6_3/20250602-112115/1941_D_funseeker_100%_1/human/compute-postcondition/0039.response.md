Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 1, `r` is an integer, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `q` is the third element in ans, and `c` is a character. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, regardless of the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
