Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`), the element ((next element in `ans` - `r`) % `n`), and the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`). Otherwise, `temp` contains the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`) and the element ((next element in `ans` + `r`) % `n`).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `temp` now contains an additional element, which is the result of adding `r` to the next element in `ans` and taking the modulus `n`. This is because the code adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`, where `q` is equal to the next element in `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
