Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `_` is 2, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?', `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', `q` is an element in the non-empty set ans, and `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `q` is still an element in the non-empty set `ans`, and `ans` still contains all possible remainders of `(each element in the initial ans + r)` divided by `n` if `c` is '0', or all possible remainders of `(each element in the initial ans + r)` divided by `n` and all possible remainders of `(each element in the initial ans - r)` divided by `n` if `c` is '?'.
