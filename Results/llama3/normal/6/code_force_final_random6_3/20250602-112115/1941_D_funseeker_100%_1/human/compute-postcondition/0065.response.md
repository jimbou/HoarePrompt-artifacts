Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise ans is an empty set, _ is m, r is an integer, c is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, q is undefined, temp is an empty set. The current value of ans contains 0***
