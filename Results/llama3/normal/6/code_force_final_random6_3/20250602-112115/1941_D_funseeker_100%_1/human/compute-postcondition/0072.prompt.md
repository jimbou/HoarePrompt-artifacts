You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, and x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n if c is '0' or '1', or all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans + r) divided by n and all possible remainders of (each element in the initial ans - r) divided by n if c is '?', otherwise ans is an empty set, _ is m, r is an integer, c is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, q is undefined, temp is an empty set.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, r is an integer, c is either '0', '1', '?' or another character, q is undefined. If 0 is in the set ans, then ans is a set containing n. Otherwise, no change is made to ans.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: 1 (if 0 is in the set ans) or the original length of ans (if 0 is not in the set ans)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: the elements of the set ans in sorted order (either a single element n if 0 is in ans, or the original elements of ans in sorted order if 0 is not in ans)

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
