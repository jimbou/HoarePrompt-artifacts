The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is increased by 3. The value of `a[i]` is the third element of the list `a`, which is increased by 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of at least one integer where the first element is increased by 1, the second element is increased by 3, and the third element is increased by 6, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
