Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a, ans is a list containing a[i+1], counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are their respective counts, i is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. If i > 0, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a minus adv, counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are their respective counts with the count of a[i - 1] decreased by adv, ans is a list containing a[i+1] and a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in range adv, i is incremented by adv, adv is greater than or equal to 0, j is adv - 1.***
