Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all elements from the original list a in descending order with all missing elements from the original list a inserted in descending order, counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, the count of duplicate elements `cnt` is 0, the list `ans` contains all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order, the dictionary `counter` has all counts set to 0, and the index `i` is reset to 0. The other variables `n` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
