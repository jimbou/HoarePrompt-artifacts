This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. The function modifies the list by adding the index plus one to each element, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and inserts missing elements in descending order. If there are remaining missing elements, it appends them to the end of the list, decreasing the last element by one for each remaining missing element. Finally, it prints the modified list.
