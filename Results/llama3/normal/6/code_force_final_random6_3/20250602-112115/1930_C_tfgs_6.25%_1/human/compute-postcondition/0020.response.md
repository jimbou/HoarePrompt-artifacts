Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `i` is an integer, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is greater than 0, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` contains `adv` elements: `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, the count of `a[i - 1]` in `counter` is decreased by `adv`, `j` is `adv - 1`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `i` is not greater than 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
