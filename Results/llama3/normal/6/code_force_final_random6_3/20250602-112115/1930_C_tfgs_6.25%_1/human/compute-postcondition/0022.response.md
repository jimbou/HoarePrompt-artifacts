To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 (no change needed)
* `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element (no change needed)
* `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a` (no change needed)
* `ans` is a list containing `a[i]` (no change needed)
* `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts (no change needed)
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases (no change needed)

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases**
