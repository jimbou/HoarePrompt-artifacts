Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all `j` in range `adv`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts with the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `adv` is calculated as the minimum of three values: the difference between the current element and the previous element minus 1 (`a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`), the total number of duplicate elements in the original list `a` (`cnt`), and the count of the previous element in the original list `a` (`counter[a[i - 1]]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
