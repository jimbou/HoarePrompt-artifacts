To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `a`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, it means that `a` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all `j` in range `adv`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts with the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases**
