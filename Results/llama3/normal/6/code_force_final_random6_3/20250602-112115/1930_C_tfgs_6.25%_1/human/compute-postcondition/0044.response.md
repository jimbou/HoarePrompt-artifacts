Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a, ans is a list containing a[i+1], a[i], and a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in range adv, counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are their respective counts with the count of a[i] decreased by 1, i is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. If i > 0, then cnt is decreased by adv, ans is updated with a[i+1], a[i], and a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in range adv, counter is updated with the count of a[i - 1] decreased by adv, i is incremented by adv, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[i - 1]], and j is adv - 1.***
