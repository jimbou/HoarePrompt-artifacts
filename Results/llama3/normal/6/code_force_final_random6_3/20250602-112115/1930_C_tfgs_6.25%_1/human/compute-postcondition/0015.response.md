Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `adv` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `a` is still a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least one element, `cnt` remains the same as the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` now contains two values: the original value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and the new value `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is still greater than 0, `counter` remains the same as a dictionary with keys as elements from the original list `a` and values as their respective counts, `adv` is still greater than 1, and `j` is still 1.
