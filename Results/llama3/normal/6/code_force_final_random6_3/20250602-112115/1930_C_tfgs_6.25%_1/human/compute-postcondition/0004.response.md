The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, where `i` is 1. So, `a[i]` is increased by 2. The first element of `a` was increased by 1, and now the second element of `a` is increased by 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of at least one integer where the first element is increased by 1 and the second element is increased by 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of at least one integer where the first element is increased by 1 and the second element is increased by 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
