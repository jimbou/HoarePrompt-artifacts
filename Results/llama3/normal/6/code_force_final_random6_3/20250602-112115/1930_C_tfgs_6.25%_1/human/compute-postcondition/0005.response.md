To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

The state of `a` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of at least one integer where the first element is increased by 1 and the second element is increased by 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
