#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all elements from the original list a in descending order with all missing elements from the original list a inserted in descending order, counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order and the last `cnt` elements are decreased by 1, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `_` is `cnt - 1`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order and the last `cnt` elements are decreased by 1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. The function modifies the list by adding the index plus one to each element, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and inserts missing elements in descending order. If there are remaining missing elements, it appends them to the end of the list, decreasing the last element by one for each remaining missing element. Finally, it prints the modified list.
