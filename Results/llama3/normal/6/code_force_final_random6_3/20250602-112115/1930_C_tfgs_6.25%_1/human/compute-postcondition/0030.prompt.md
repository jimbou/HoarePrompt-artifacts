Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, stdin contains multiple test cases
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is greater than 0, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
