The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. So, `a[i]` is increased by 1. The value of `a` is updated, and the values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of at least one integer where the first element is increased by 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
