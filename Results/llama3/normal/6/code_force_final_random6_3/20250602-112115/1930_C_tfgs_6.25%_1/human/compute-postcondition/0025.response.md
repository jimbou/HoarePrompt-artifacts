Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is greater than 0, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases**

The value of `ans` is updated by appending `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `a[i - 1]` is the second last element in the sorted list `a` and `j` is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
