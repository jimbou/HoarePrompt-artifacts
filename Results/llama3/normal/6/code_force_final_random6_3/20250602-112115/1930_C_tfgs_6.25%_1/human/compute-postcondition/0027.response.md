Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `a` is still a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least one element, `cnt` remains the same as the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `counter` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is still greater than 1, `j` is still 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases.
