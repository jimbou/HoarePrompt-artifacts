To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is equal to the number of integers in the current test case, we can infer that there must be at least one integer in the test case for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the range function.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of at least one integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
