Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order and the last `cnt` elements are decreased by 1, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `_` is `cnt - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will have its last `cnt` elements decreased by 1, and the loop counter `_` will be one less than the initial value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
