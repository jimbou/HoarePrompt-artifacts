To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `cnt`. The loop will execute if `cnt` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is at least 1, `ans` is a list containing all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0**
