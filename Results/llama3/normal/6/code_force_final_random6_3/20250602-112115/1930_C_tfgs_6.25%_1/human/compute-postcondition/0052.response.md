Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is at least 1, `ans` is a list containing all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order and the last three elements are decreased by 1, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `_` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `a` is still an empty list, `cnt` is still at least 1, `ans` now has one more element which is one less than the last element of the original list `ans`, `counter` remains unchanged, `i` is still 0, and there are still multiple test cases in `stdin`. The value of `_` is still 2.
