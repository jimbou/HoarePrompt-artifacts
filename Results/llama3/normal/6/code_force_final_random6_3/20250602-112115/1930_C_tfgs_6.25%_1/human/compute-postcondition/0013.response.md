Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the result of the expression `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The value of `a[i - 1]` is the second last element in the list `a` (since `i` is greater than 0 and `a` is 0-indexed), and `j` is 0. Therefore, the value appended to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
