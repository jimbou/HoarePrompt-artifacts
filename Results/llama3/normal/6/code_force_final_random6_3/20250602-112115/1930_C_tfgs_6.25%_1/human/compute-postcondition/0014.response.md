The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `adv` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `adv` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `adv` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
