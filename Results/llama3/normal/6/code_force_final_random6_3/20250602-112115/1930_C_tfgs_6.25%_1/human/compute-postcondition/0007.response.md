Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `a` has been modified such that each element at index `i` has been incremented by `i + 1`, the loop counter `i` has reached its final value which is `n - 1`, and the state of the standard input remains unchanged.
