Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i+1]`, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are their respective counts, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, stdin contains multiple test cases**

In this output state, the value of `adv` is calculated as the minimum of three values: the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `a` minus 1, the total count of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, and the count of the previous element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
