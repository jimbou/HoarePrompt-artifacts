Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the current test case, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is the number of integers in the current test case, which is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive). The value of `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
