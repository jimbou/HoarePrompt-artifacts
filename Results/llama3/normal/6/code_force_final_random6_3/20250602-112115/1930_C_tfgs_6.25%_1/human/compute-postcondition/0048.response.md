Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is at least 1, `ans` is a list containing all elements from the original list `a` in descending order with all missing elements from the original list `a` inserted in descending order and the last element is decreased by 1, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list `a` and values are 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0**

The code appends a new element to the `ans` list, which is the last element of the list minus 1. This means the last element of the `ans` list is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
