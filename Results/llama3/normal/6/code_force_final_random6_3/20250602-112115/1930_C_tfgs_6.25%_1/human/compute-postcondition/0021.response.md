Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a, ans is a list containing a[i], counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are their respective counts, the count of a[i] in counter is decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `ans` and decreases the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `counter` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `cnt` is not affected by the code, so its value remains the same. The variable `i` is not modified by the code, so its value remains the same. The variable `j` is not affected by the code, so its value remains the same. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
