Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 element, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing adv elements: a[i - 1] - j - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is greater than 0, counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are their respective counts, with the count of a[i - 1] decreased by adv, adv must be greater than or equal to 0, j is adv - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been decreased by `adv`, and the count of `a[i - 1]` in the `counter` dictionary has been decreased by `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged.
