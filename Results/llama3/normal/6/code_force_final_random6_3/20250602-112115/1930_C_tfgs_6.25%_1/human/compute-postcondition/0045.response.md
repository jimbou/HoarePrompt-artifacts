Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a, ans is a list containing a[i+1], a[i], and a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in range adv, and a[i], counter is a dictionary where keys are elements from the original list a and values are their respective counts with the count of a[i] decreased by 1, i is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `ans`. The dictionary `counter` is updated by decreasing the count of `a[i]` by 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid.
