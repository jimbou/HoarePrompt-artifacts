To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, since the range function in Python can handle a start value of 0. However, to guarantee that the loop executes at least once, `n` should be greater than -1.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1**
