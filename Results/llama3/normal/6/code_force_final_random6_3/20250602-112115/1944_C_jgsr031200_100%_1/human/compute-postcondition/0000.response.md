Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `freq` which is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be a non-negative integer since `arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
