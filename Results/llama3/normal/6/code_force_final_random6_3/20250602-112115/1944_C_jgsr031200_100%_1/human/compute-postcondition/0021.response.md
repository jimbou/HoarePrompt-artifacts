The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `n` is greater than -1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the last element in `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr`.**
