Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 2, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, `cou` is increased by 1, and the value of `i` which is the last element in `arr` plus 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain the same. If the frequency of the last element in `arr` plus 2 is greater than or equal to 2, the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, the counter `cou` is increased by 1, and the value of `i` (which is the last element in `arr` plus 2) is being printed.
