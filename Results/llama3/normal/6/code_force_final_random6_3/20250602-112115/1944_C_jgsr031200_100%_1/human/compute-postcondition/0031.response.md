The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 2, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr` plus 1**
