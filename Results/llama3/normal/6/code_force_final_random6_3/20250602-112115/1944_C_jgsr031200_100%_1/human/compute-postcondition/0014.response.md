Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `cou` is 1, `n` is greater than -1. The frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is still exactly 1, and `n` is still greater than -1.
