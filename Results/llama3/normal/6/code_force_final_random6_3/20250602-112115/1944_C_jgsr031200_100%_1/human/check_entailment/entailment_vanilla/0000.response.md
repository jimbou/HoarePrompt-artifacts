Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program starts by reading the input, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the elements of the array. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes the array as input and calculates the frequency of each element in the array.

The function `func_1` uses a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each element in the input array. It then iterates through the frequency array, checking for elements that appear only once or not at all. If it finds an element that appears only once, it increments a counter `cou`. If it finds an element that appears twice or not at all, it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

The reasoning behind this approach is that Alice and Bob will try to maximize or minimize the MEX of the resulting array by picking elements that appear only once or not at all. The program assumes that the optimal strategy for both players is to pick elements that appear only once, and then pick elements that appear twice or not at all.

However, there is a flaw in this reasoning. The program does not consider the case where Alice and Bob pick elements that appear more than twice. In such cases, the MEX of the resulting array may be different from the one calculated by the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
