#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, and `i` is the last element in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `cou` is either 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the first number that appears only once in the list, or the first number that does not appear in the list at all. If no such number is found, it prints the last number in the list. The function modifies the input list by creating a frequency count of each number in the list, but the original list remains unchanged. The function returns no value, only printing the result to the console.
