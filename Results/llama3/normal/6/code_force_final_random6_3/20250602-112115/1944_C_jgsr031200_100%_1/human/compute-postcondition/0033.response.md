Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 2, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr` plus 1, `cou` is increased by 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1. The other variables, `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The conditional statement regarding `freq[i]` still holds true, meaning that if `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program maintains the current state, and otherwise, no changes are made.
