Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr`. If the frequency of `i` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the loop skips to the next iteration, and the value of `i` which is the last element in `arr` plus 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `cou` is increased by 1 if the frequency of `i` is 1, otherwise, it remains the same. The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` is printed.
