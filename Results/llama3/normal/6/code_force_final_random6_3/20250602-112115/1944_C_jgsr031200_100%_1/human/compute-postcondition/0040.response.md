Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the first number that appears only once in the list, or the first number that does not appear in the list at all. If no such number is found, it prints the last number in the list. The function modifies the input list by creating a frequency count of each number in the list, but the original list remains unchanged. The function returns no value, only printing the result to the console.**
