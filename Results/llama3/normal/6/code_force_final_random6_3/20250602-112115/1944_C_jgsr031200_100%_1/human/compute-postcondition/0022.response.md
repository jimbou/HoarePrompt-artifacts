Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, as the `continue` statement only skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one. The loop continues to execute, but the current iteration is skipped.
