Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the second element in `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `freq[i]` has been updated to 2, since the code increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. The other variables, `arr` and `i`, remain unchanged. The precondition that `arr` has at least 2 elements and `i` is the second element in `arr` is still valid.
