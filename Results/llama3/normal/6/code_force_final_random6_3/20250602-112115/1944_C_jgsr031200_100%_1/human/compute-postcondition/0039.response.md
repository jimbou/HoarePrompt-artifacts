Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `cou` is either 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `arr` and the frequency list `freq` remain unchanged. The variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the upper limit of the loop. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, indicating that the loop has covered all values from 0 to `n`. The variable `cou` has either reached the value of 2 or the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 0, which are the conditions that cause the loop to break.
