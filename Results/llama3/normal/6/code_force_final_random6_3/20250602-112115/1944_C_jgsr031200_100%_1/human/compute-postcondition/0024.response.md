Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr`, `cou` is increased by 1. If the frequency of `i` is 2 or more, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the frequency of `i` and the loop iteration still apply.
