Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `n` is greater than -1. If the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 1, then the current value of `cou` is 2. Otherwise, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. The current value of `cou` is either 2 or the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 0, and the last element of the list `arr` which is `i` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `cou` is still either 2 or the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 0. The last element of the list `arr` which is `i` is being printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
