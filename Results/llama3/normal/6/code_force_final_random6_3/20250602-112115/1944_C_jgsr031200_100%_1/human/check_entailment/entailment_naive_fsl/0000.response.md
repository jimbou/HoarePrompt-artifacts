Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game strategy for Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the array and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n. If a number has a frequency of 1, it increments the counter `cou`. If the counter `cou` becomes 2 or if a number has a frequency of 0, it prints the current number `i` and breaks the loop.

This strategy is correct because Alice wants to maximize the score, which is the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, Alice should choose the numbers that appear only once in the array, because these numbers will not be chosen by Bob. If there are two numbers that appear only once, Alice should choose the smaller one, because this will give her a higher score. If there are no numbers that appear only once, Alice should choose the smallest number that appears twice, because this will give her a higher score than choosing a number that appears more than twice.

The program correctly implements this strategy by iterating through the numbers from 0 to n and checking their frequencies. If a number has a frequency of 1, it increments the counter `cou`. If the counter `cou` becomes 2 or if a number has a frequency of 0, it prints the current number `i` and breaks the loop. This ensures that Alice chooses the correct number to maximize her score.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
