Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 2, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr` plus 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, no changes are made.***

Note: Since the else part has no changes, the postcondition only considers the if part and the initial state described in the precondition.
