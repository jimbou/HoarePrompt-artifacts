To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to have at least one element, and the state of `i` to be the first element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
