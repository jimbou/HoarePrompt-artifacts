Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program first reads the input array and creates a frequency count of each number in the array. It then iterates through the frequency count, checking for numbers that appear only once or not at all. If it finds such a number, it prints it as the final score.

The program's logic is correct, as it accurately implements the rules of the game and the definition of MEX. The use of a frequency count to keep track of the numbers in the array is efficient and effective.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1(arr)` is called, but it is not defined anywhere in the code. This would cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

Assuming that the function `func_1(arr)` is defined elsewhere in the code and is not relevant to the problem at hand, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
