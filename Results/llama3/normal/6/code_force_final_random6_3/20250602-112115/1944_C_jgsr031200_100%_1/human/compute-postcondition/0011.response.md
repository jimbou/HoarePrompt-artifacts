Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` is greater than -1. The current value of `freq[i]` is 2 or more and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `arr`, `freq`, `i`, `cou`, and `n` remain unchanged.
