Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

The program first reads the input array `arr` and creates a frequency list `freq` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. It then iterates through the frequency list and checks for the following conditions:

1. If an element has a frequency of 2 or more, it skips to the next element.
2. If an element has a frequency of 1, it increments a counter `cou`.
3. If the counter `cou` reaches 2 or if an element has a frequency of 0, it prints the current element `i` and breaks the loop.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If an element has a frequency of 2 or more, it means that both Alice and Bob can pick this element, and it will not affect the MEX of `c`. Therefore, the program skips to the next element.
* If an element has a frequency of 1, it means that only one player can pick this element. The program increments the counter `cou` to keep track of the number of such elements.
* If the counter `cou` reaches 2, it means that there are at least two elements that can be picked by only one player. In this case, the program prints the current element `i`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`.
* If an element has a frequency of 0, it means that this element does not occur in `arr`. In this case, the program prints the current element `i`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`.

The program's approach is correct because it takes into account the optimal strategy for both players. By skipping elements with frequency 2 or more, the program ensures that Alice and Bob do not pick elements that will not affect the MEX of `c`. By incrementing the counter `cou` for elements with frequency 1, the program keeps track of the number of elements that can be picked by only one player. Finally, by printing the current element `i` when the counter `cou` reaches 2 or when an element has a frequency of 0, the program ensures that the final score is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`.

Correctness: **True**
