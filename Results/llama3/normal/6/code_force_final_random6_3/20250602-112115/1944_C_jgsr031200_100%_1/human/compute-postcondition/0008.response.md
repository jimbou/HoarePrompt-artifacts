Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, and `cou` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `cou` and initialized it to 0. The values of the other variables, `arr`, `freq`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The relationship between `freq` and `arr` is still valid, where `freq[i]` represents the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`. The value of `i` is still the last element in `arr`.
