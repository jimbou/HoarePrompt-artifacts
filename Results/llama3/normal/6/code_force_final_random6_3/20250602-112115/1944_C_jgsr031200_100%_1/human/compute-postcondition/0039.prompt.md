Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, and `cou` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `n` is greater than -1. If the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 1, then the current value of `cou` is 2. Otherwise, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. If the current value of `cou` is 2 or the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 0, then the last element of the list `arr` which is `i` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr`. If the frequency of `i` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the loop skips to the next iteration. If `cou` is equal to 2 or `freq[i]` is equal to 0, the value of `i` which is the last element in `arr` plus 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 2, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr` plus 1. If `cou` is equal to 2 or `freq[i]` is equal to 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the value of `i`. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, `cou` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
