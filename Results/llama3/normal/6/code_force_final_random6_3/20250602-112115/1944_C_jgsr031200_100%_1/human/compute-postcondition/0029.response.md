Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 1, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr`. If the frequency of `i` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the loop skips to the next iteration. If `cou` is equal to 2 or `freq[i]` is equal to 0, the value of `i` which is the last element in `arr` plus 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
