Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `arr`. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged. The list `freq` now has a value of 1 at index `i`, and all other elements remain 0.
