Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr` plus 2, `n` is greater than the last element in `arr` plus 1. If `cou` is equal to 2 or `freq[i]` is equal to 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the value of `i`. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, `cou` is increased by 1.***
