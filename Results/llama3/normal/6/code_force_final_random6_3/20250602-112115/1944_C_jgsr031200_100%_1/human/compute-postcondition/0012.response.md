Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` is greater than -1. If the frequency of the last element `i` in `arr` is 2 or more, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, the code continues to execute normally.***
