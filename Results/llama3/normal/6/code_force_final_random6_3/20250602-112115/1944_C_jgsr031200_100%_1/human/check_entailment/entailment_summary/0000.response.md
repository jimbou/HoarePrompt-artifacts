Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob minimizes it. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the array. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) and checks if the frequency of the current number is 1 or 0. If the frequency is 1, it increments a counter. If the frequency is 0 or the counter is 2, it prints the current number and breaks the loop. This is because Alice wants to maximize the score, so she will choose the smallest number that appears only once in the array, or the smallest number that does not appear in the array at all.

Correctness: **True**
