Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where `freq[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `arr`, and `i` is the last element in `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `arr` list remains unchanged, but the `freq` list now contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`. The variable `i` now holds the value of the last element in `arr`.
