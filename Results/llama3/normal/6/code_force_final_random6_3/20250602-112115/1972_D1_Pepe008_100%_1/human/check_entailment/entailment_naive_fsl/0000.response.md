Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x` and the additional condition for incrementing `suma`.

The correct calculation for `x` should be `x = (a - 1) // (i ** 2 // math.gcd(i, a)) + 1`, not `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This is because we need to find the number of values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, which is equivalent to `a` being a multiple of `i ** 2 // math.gcd(i, a)`.

Additionally, the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - 1) // (i ** 2 // math.gcd(i, a)) + 1
            suma += x
        print(suma)
```

This corrected implementation should produce the correct results for all test cases.
