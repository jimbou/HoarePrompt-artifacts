Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, suma is the sum of x for all i from 1 to b where x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, then suma is increased by 1 for each such i, i is equal to b + 1, and the value of suma - 2 is being printed, where suma - 2 is equal to the sum of x for all i from 1 to b where x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1 minus 2, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, then suma - 2 is increased by 1 for each such i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, i is equal to b + 1, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for i from 1 to b. If ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0) for some i, then suma is incremented by the number of times this condition is true, and the value of suma - 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, i is equal to b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is the sum of all x values from i = 1 to b, where each x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) is divisible by i^2 and i * (i - 1) is divisible by i^2, then suma is incremented by 1 for each such i, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
