Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is increased by `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` is increased by `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.***
