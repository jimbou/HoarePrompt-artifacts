Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is increased by `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is still 0, stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is still a positive integer, b is still greater than or equal to 3, i is still 3, x is still a positive integer equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i, and suma has been increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1).
