The code snippet provided reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values to `a` and `b`. It then initializes a variable `suma` to 0.

Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, suma is 0**
