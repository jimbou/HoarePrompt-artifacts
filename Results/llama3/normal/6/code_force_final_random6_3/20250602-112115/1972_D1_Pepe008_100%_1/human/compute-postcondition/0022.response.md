Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is a positive integer, b must be greater than or equal to 3, i is 3, x is a positive integer equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i. If (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0 and (a - i * (i - 1)) % i != 0, then the function returns x. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
