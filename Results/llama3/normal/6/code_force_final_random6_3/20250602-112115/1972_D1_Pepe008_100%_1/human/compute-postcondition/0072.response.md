Postcondition: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 3, i is 3, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If (a - i * (i - 1)) is divisible by i^2 and i * (i - 1) is divisible by i^2, then suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 4 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3. Otherwise, suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2. If x is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
