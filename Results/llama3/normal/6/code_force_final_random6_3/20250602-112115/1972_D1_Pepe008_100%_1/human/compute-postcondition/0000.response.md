The code `T = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a positive integer t, and assigns it to the variable T. The value of T is now a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, each containing two positive integers n and m.

Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m.**
