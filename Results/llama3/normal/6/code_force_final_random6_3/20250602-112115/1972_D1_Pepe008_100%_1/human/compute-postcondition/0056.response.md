Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 0, i is 1, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and the current value of x is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of suma has been updated to be equal to x, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
