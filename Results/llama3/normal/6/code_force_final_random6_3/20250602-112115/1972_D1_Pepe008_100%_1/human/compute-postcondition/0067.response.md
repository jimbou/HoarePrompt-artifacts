The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 3.
State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 3, i is 3, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If the current value of x is greater than 0, then if the remainder of ((a - i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2 is 0, and the remainder of (i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2 is also 0, then suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3. Otherwise, suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2.**
