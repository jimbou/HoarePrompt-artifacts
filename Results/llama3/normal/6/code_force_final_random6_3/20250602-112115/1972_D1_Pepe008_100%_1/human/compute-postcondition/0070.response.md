Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and `suma` is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 4 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, t remains 2, there are still multiple lines of input in stdin minus three lines that were read, a is still a positive integer, b is still greater than 3, i is still 3, x is still ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and suma has been increased by 1, so it is now either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 4 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3.
