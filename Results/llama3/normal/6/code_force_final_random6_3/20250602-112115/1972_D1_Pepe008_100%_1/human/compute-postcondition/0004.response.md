Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is still 0, stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is still a positive integer, suma is still 0, b is still greater than 0, i is still 1, and a new variable x is introduced, which is a positive integer equal to the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
