Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 3, i is 3, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, and suma is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.**

In this output state, the value of suma is increased by the value of x, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, depending on the remainder of ((a - i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2 and the remainder of (i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2.
