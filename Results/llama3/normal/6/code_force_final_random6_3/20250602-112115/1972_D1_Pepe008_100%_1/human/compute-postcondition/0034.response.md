Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1. If ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), then `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. Otherwise, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.***
