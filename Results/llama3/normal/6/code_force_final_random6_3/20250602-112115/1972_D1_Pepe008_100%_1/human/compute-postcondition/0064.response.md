Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 1, i is 2, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3.**

In this output state, the value of suma has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read.
