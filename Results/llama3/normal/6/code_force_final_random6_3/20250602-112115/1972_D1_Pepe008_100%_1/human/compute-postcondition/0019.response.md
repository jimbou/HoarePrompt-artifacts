Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is increased by `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been increased by the value of `x`, which is calculated as `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read.
