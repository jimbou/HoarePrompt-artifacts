Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is equal to `suma` plus `x` which is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1**.

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, which is a new expression that takes into account the square of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships.
