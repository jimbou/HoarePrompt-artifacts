Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), then `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2 and `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `x` is recalculated based on the values of `a` and `i`. The value of `x` is now equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1`, which is the same as its initial value. The condition for `suma` remains the same, and its value is not changed by the code.
