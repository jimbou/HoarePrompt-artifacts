To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `x`, and `suma`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0), then if ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3. Otherwise, `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2.**
