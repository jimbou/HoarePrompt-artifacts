The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is equal to `suma` plus `x` which is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i**
