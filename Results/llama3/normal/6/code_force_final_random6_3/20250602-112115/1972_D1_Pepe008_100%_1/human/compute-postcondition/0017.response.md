To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` must be greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, and `x`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
