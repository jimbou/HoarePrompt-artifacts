Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 0, i is 1, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, suma is 0**

In this output state, the value of x has been updated to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, where i is 1. This simplifies to (a - 0) // 1 + 1, which is equal to a + 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
