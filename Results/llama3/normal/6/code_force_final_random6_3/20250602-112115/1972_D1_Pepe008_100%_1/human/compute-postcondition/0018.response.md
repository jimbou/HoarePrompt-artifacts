Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)`**

The value of `x` is updated to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)`, which is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now dependent on the values of `a` and `i`, which are still a positive integer and 3, respectively. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read.
