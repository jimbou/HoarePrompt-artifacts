Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program reads input, processes it according to the problem's requirements, and prints the calculated sum minus 2 for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the program contains a logical error. The line `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. This line is attempting to check if `i * (i - 1)` is a multiple of `i ** 2`, but this condition is always true because `i * (i - 1)` is always a multiple of `i`.

Moreover, the program subtracts 2 from the calculated sum without any clear justification. This subtraction seems arbitrary and may not be correct for all test cases.

Given these issues, it is likely that the program does not produce the correct results for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
