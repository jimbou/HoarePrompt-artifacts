Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0, then `suma` is either 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 4 or 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3. Otherwise, `suma` is either 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2 and `suma` is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.***
