Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 if ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), otherwise `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `suma` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `suma` remain the same, but the value has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
