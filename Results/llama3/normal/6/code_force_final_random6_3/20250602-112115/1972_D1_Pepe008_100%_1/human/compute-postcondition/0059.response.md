Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 0, i is 1, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and the current value of x is greater than 0. If the remainder of ((a - i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2 is 0, and the remainder of (i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2 is also 0, then suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2. Otherwise, suma remains ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.***
