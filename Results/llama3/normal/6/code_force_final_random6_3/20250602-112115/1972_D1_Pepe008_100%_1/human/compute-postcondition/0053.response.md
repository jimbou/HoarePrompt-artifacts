The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If b is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is equal to b + 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and b is greater than 0. 
State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 0, i is 1, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is 0**
