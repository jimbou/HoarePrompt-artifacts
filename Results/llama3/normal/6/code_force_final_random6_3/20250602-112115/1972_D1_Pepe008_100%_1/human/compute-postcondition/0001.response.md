The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) ensures that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. `t` is now 0.
State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m.**
