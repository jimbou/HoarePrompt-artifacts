To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1. Since `b` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `b` must be greater than 0.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so we can initialize it to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, and `suma` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
