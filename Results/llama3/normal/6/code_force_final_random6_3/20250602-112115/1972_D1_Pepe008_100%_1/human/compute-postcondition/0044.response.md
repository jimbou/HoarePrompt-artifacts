Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, `suma` is either 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, and `suma` is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `suma`, which is increased by the value of `x`. The value of `suma` is either 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3 or 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, depending on the conditions specified in the initial state, and it is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.
