To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for t in range(T):`, so we can only adjust the states of `t` and `T`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, and `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1, so `t` becomes 1. The value of `T` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `suma` is the sum of `x` for all `i` from 1 to `b` where `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1`, and if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, then `suma` is increased by 1 for each such `i`, `i` is equal to `b + 1`, and the value of `suma - 2` is being printed, where `suma - 2` is equal to the sum of `x` for all `i` from 1 to `b` where `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1` minus 2, and if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, then `suma - 2` is increased by 1 for each such `i`**
