Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is equal to `suma` plus `x` which is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The current value of `x` squared plus 1 is greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x`, which is calculated based on the values of `a` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still a positive integer, and its square plus 1 is still greater than 0.
