Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `i`. Since `i` is 1, the expression `(a - i * (i - 1))` simplifies to `a`, and `i^2` is 1. Therefore, `x` is equal to `a // 1 + 1`, which is simply `a + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
