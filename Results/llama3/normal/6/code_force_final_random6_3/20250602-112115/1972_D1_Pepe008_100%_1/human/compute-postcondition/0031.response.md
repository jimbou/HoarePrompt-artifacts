Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.**

The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x`, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
