Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0), then if ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3. Otherwise, `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been recalculated based on the given formula, but its value remains the same as before because the formula is the same as the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.
