To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `b` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `b` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `suma`, and `x`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1. If ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), then `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2**
