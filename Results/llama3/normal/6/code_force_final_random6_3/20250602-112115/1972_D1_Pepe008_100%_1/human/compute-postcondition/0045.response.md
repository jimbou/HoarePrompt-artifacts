Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and `suma` is either 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 4 or 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suma` can be either 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 4 or 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 3, depending on its previous value.
