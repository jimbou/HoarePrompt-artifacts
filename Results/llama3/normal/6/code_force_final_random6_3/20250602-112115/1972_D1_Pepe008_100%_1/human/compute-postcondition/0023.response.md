Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, suma is the sum of x for all i from 1 to b where x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, then suma is increased by 1 for each such i, i is equal to b + 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `suma` will hold the sum of the values of `x` for each iteration of the loop, where `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1`. Additionally, if the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` are met for any iteration `i`, then `suma` will be increased by 1 for each such iteration. The loop will have executed `b` times, and the variable `i` will be equal to `b + 1` after the loop finishes. The other variables `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
