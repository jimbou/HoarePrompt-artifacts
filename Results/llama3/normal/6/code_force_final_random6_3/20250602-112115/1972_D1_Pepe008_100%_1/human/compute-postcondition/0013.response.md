Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is equal to `suma` plus `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i**

The code increments the value of `suma` by `x`, which is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Since `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(a - 2) // 2`. Therefore, `suma` is now equal to its previous value plus `(a - 2) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
