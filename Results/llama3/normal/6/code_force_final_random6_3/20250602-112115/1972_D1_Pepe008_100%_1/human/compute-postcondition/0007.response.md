Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is equal to `suma` plus `x` which is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The current value of `x` squared plus 1 is greater than 0. Additionally, the remainder of `(a - i * (i - 1))` divided by `i` squared is 0, and the remainder of `i * (i - 1)` divided by `i` squared is also 0.***
