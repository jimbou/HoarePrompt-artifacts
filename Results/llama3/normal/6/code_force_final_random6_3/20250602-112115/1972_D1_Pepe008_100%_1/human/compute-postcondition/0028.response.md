According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `b + 1`, which means `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be at least 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
