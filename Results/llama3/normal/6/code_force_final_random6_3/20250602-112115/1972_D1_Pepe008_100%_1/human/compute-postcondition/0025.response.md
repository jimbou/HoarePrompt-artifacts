Output: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, suma is the sum of x for all i from 1 to b where x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, then suma is increased by 1 for each such i, i is equal to b + 1, and the value of suma - 2 is being printed, where suma - 2 is equal to the sum of x for all i from 1 to b where x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1 minus 2, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, then suma - 2 is increased by 1 for each such i**
