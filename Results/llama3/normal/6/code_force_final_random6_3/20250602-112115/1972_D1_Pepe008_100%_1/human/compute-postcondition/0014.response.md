Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` is a positive integer, `suma` is equal to `suma` plus `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` plus 1, `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i**.

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state's conditions, such as `T` being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` being 0, `stdin` containing multiple lines of input minus one line that was read, `a` being a positive integer, `b` being greater than 1, `i` being 2, and `x` being a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, are still valid.
