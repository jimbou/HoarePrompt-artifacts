Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, i is equal to b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is the sum of all x values from i = 1 to b, where each x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, and if (a - i * (i - 1)) is divisible by i^2 and i * (i - 1) is divisible by i^2, then suma is incremented by 1 for each such i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` is now equal to `b`, and the variable `suma` has accumulated the sum of all `x` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, where each `x` is calculated as `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1`. Additionally, if the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1))` is divisible by `i^2` and `i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i^2` are met for any iteration, the `suma` is incremented by 1 for each such iteration. The values of `T`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
