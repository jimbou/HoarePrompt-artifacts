Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2 if ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0), otherwise `suma` is 2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. If the remainder of `(a - i * (i - 1))` divided by `i^2` is 0 and the remainder of `i * (i - 1)` divided by `i^2` is also 0, then `suma` becomes twice the integer division of `(a - i * (i - 1))` by `i^2` plus 2. Otherwise, `suma` becomes twice the integer division of `(a - i * (i - 1))` by `i^2` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
