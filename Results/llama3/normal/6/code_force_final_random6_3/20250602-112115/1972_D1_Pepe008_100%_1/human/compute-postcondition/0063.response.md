Output State: **T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), t is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 1, i is 2, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2.**

The value of suma is incremented by x. Since x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1, the new value of suma is either ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2 or ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 2, depending on the remainder of ((a - i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2 and the remainder of (i * (i - 1)) divided by i^2. The other variables remain unchanged.
