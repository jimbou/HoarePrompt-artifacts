Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing the integer 2 and output2 is a list containing the integer value of `x` divided by 2. Otherwise, there is no output.***
