Output State: **output1 is a list of divisors of x in reverse order, output2 is a list of corresponding quotient values, x remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the list of divisors of x, which was initially stored in output1, has been reversed. This means that the order of the divisors has been flipped, with the last divisor becoming the first and the first divisor becoming the last. The list of corresponding quotient values, stored in output2, remains unchanged. The value of x also remains unchanged.
