To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The value of `x` is not changed by the loop head, so it remains the same.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1. `i` is 2.**

Note that the values of `output1` and `output2` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same as before.
