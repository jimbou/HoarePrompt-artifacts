To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1.

State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 1, output1 is an empty list, output2 is an empty list**
