To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):`. The objects involved are `i` and `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. Since `x` is not modified in the loop head, its state remains the same.

The output variables `output1` and `output2` are not part of the loop head, so their states are not adjusted.

State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing the integer 3 and output2 is a list containing the integer value of `x` divided by 3. Otherwise, there is no output.**
