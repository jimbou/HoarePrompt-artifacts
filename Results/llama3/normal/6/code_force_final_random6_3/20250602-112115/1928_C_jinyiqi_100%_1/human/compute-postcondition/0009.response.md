Output State: **x is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1, i is 3, output1 is a list containing the integer 3, output2 is a list containing the integer value of x divided by 3.**

The code block consists of two lines that modify the state of the variables. The first line appends the value of `i` to `output1`, making it a list containing the integer 3. The second line appends the integer value of `x` divided by `i` to `output2`. Since `x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, and `i` is 3, the value of `x` divided by `i` will be an integer. The value of `x` is not modified by the code, so it remains a list of two integers that meet the specified conditions. The value of `i` is also not modified by the code, so it remains 3.
