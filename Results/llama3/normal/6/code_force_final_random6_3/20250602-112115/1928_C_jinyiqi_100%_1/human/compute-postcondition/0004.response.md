Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1. `i` is 1. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is [1] and output2 is [[x[0], x[1]]]. Otherwise, no changes are made to output1 and output2.***
