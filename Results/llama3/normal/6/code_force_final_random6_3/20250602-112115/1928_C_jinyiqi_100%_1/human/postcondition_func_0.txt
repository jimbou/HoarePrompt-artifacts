This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a combined list of corresponding quotient values and divisors of the input integers in reverse order, without modifying the original input list. The function effectively computes and returns all divisors and their corresponding quotients for the input integers.
