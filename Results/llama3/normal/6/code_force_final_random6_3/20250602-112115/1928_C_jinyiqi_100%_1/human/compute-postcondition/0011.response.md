Output State: **output1 is a list of divisors of x, output2 is a list of corresponding quotient values, x remains unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be such that output1 will contain all the divisors of the original value of x, and output2 will contain the corresponding quotient values. The value of x remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
