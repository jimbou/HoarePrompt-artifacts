The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `i` to `output1`. Since `i` is 1, `output1` becomes `[1]`. The second line appends the integer value of `x` divided by `i` to `output2`. Since `x` is a list of two integers and `i` is 1, the division operation will result in the same list of integers. Therefore, `output2` becomes `[[x[0], x[1]]]`.

Output State: **x is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1. The current value of x is divisible by i. i is 1. output1 is [1], output2 is [[x[0], x[1]]]**
