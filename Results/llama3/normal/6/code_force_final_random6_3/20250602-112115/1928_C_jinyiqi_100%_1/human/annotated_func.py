#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1.
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: output1 is a list of divisors of x, output2 is a list of corresponding quotient values, x remains unchanged.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a combined list of corresponding quotient values and divisors of x in reverse order, where x remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a combined list of corresponding quotient values and divisors of the input integers in reverse order, without modifying the original input list. The function effectively computes and returns all divisors and their corresponding quotients for the input integers.
