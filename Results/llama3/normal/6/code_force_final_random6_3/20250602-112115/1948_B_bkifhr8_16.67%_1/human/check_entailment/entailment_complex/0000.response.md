Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if a given integer array can be made sorted in non-descending order by applying a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program iterates through the array from the second element to the end. If it encounters an element that is smaller than its previous element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the array. This process is repeated until the end of the array is reached.

After modifying the array, the program checks if the array is sorted in ascending order using the function `func_1`. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks for the condition where an element is smaller than its previous element and the previous element is greater than 10. It does not consider the case where an element is greater than its next element and the element is greater than 10. In such a case, the program should split the element into its digits and insert them into the array.

For example, consider the array [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into its digits and insert them into the array, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, it will not split the third element into its digits, even though it is greater than 10 and its next element is smaller. As a result, the array will not be sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
