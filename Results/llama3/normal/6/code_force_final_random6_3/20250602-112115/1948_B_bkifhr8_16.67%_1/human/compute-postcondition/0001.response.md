Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.**

In this case, since `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers with the same elements as `lst` in ascending order, the comparison `lst == sorted_lst` will return `True` if `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.
