Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is [12, 3, 45, 67], the program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element into [4, 5, 67] because it only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. However, in this case, the third element is greater than 10 and can be split, but the program does not do so.

The program only checks if the previous element can be split, but it does not check if the current element can be split. This means that the program may not always produce a sorted array, even if it is possible to do so by splitting some elements.

To fix this issue, the program should check if each element can be split, not just the previous element. It should also continue to check if the array is sorted after splitting each element, and repeat the process until the array is sorted or it is determined that it is not possible to sort the array.
