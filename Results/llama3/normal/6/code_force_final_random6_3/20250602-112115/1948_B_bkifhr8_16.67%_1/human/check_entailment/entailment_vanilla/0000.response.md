Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list and splitting any number greater than 10 that is followed by a smaller number. It then checks if the resulting list is sorted.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The program only splits the number if it is greater than 10 and the next number is smaller. But it does not consider the case where the number is greater than 10 and the next number is also greater than 10. In this case, the program should also split the number.

2. The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. However, this function sorts the list and then checks if it is equal to the original list. This is not efficient, especially for large lists. A more efficient way would be to iterate through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element.

3. The program does not handle the case where the list is already sorted. In this case, the program should print 'Yes' without modifying the list.

4. The program does not handle the case where the list cannot be sorted by splitting numbers. In this case, the program should print 'No'.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In this case, the program should print 'Yes' because an empty list is considered sorted.

Considering these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
