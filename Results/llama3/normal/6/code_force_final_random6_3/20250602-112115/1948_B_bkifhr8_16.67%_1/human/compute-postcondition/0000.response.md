Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers, where the elements of `sorted_lst` are the same as the elements of `lst`, but in ascending order.**

In this output state, the list `lst` remains unchanged, but a new list `sorted_lst` is created, which contains the same elements as `lst`, but in sorted order. The elements of `sorted_lst` are arranged in ascending order, meaning that the smallest element comes first, followed by the next smallest, and so on, until the largest element.
