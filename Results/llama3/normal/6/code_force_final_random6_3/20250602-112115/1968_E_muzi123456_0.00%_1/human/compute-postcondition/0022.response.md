Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, n is an integer, i is n, and the number 1 is printed n times, and the values of i from 1 to n are printed, and a space is printed**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 48 inclusive. The value of `n` has been updated to the integer value read from the input. The value of `i` remains the same as `n`. The number 1 is printed `n` times, and the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed, followed by a space.
