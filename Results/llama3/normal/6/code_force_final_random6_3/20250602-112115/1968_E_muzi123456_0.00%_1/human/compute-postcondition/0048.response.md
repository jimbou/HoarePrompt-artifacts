The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, the number 1 is printed `n` times, the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed, a space is printed, an additional space is printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: '1' (followed by a space), and the value of `i` which is 1 is printed**
