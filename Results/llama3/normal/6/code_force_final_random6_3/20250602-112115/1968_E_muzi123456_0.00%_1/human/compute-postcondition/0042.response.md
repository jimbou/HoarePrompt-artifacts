Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, n is an integer, i is n, the number 1 is printed n times, the values of i from 1 to n are printed, a space is printed, an additional space is printed, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer value read from the input, and `i` is still equal to `n`. The number 1 is printed `n` times, and the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed, along with two spaces. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been read and processed.
