Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, the number 1 is printed `n` times, and the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed, and a space is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, `n` retains its initial value, and `i` has iterated through all values from 1 to `n`. The loop has printed the number 1 a total of `n` times, followed by the values of `i` from 1 to `n`, and a space is printed after each iteration.
