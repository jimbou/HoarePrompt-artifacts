According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, the number 1 is printed `n` times, and the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed, and a space is printed, and an additional space is printed**
