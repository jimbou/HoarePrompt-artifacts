Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program simply prints the coordinates (1, i) for i from 1 to n, which does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, the optimal arrangement is:

2 1
2 3
3 1

Which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
