Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. However, the program is not correctly implementing the solution.

The program is simply printing the coordinates (1, i) for i from 1 to n, which does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The correct solution involves placing the cells in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

For example, for n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, the correct solution is to place the cells at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which gives a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
