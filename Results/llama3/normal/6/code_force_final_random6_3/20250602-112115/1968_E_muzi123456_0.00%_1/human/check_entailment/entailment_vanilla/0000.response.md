Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then uses a loop to print the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The loop iterates from 1 to n, and for each iteration, it prints the coordinates (1, i), where i is the current iteration number.

However, the program has a logical error. The loop should iterate from 1 to n, but it should print the coordinates (i, 1) instead of (1, i). This is because the problem statement requires the cells to be chosen such that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is maximized. By printing the coordinates (i, 1), the program ensures that the cells are chosen in a way that maximizes the Manhattan distance.

Additionally, the program has a syntax error. The print statement inside the loop is incorrect. The correct print statement should be print(i, 1) instead of print('1', end=' ') print(i).

Correctness: **False**
