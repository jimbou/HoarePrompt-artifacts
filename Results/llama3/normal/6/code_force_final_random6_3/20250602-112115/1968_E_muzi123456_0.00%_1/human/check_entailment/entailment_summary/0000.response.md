Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The task is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program simply prints the number 1 followed by the numbers from 1 to n, which does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, for the input n = 3, the program prints "1 1", "1 2", and "1 3", which corresponds to the cells (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, as the Manhattan distance between (1,1) and (1,2) is the same as the Manhattan distance between (1,2) and (1,3), which is 1.

A correct solution would involve choosing cells in a way that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for n = 3, a correct arrangement could be (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which corresponds to the Manhattan distances 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Correctness: **False**
