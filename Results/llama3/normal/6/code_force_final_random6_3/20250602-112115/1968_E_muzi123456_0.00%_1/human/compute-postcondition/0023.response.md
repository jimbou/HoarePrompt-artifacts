To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, the number 1 is printed n times, and the values of i from 1 to n are printed, and a space is printed**
