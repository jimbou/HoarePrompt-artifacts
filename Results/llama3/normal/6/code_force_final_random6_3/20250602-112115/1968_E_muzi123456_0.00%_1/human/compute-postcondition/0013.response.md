To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.


At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.


State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and the number 2 is being printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and this is printed: '1', and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
