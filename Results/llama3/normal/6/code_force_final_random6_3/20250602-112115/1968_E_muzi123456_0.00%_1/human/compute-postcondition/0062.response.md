Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n. For each test case, it prints the number 1 followed by the numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces, and then prints an additional space. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read and processed, at which point it terminates.**
