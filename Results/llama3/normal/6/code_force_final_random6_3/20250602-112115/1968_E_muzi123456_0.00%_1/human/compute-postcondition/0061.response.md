Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, i is n, the number 1 is printed n times, the values of i from 1 to n are printed, and a space is printed, and an additional space is printed for each test case in stdin, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable t becomes 0, the variable n remains an integer, the variable i becomes equal to n, the number 1 is printed n times, the values of i from 1 to n are printed, and a space is printed after each test case in stdin. Additionally, an extra space is printed for each test case in stdin, and stdin contains no input after all the iterations are completed.
