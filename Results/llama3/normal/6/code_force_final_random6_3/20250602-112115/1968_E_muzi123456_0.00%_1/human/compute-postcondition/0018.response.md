Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer, stdin contains test cases - 1, `i` is `n`, and the number 1 is printed `n` times, and the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, and there are `n-1` fewer test cases in stdin. The loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the number 1 has been printed `n` times, followed by the values of `i` from 1 to `n`.
