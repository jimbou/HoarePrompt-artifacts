Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, the number 1 is printed `n` times, the values of `i` from 1 to `n` are printed, a space is printed, an additional space is printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: '1' (followed by a space), and the value of `i` which is 1 is printed, and '1' (followed by a space) is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and ... , and '1' (followed by a space) is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The initial state remains unchanged except for the loop counter `i` which is now equal to `n`. The number 1 is printed `n` times, followed by the values of `i` from 1 to `n`, and two spaces are printed. The output also includes the sequence of '1' (followed by a space) and the value of `i` printed for each iteration of the loop, ending with the value of `i` which is `n`.
