The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an input integer (t) (1 <= t <= 50) representing the number of test cases. This integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains test cases. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains test cases.
Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains test cases.**
