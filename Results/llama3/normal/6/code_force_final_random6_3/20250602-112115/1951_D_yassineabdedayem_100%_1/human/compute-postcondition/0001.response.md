To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it's iterating over). Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `stdin` contains `t` lines of input, we can infer that for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 line of input**
