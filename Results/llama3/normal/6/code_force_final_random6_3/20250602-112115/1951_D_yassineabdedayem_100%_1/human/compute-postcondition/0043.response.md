Postcondition: ***_ is 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains at least -1 lines of input. If `n + 2` is larger than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
