Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is greater than k * 2 and n is not equal to k. In this case, the program prints 'NO', but it is actually possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

For example, if n = 10 and k = 3, the program prints 'NO', but it is possible to set up the stalls as follows:

* Stall 1: price = 3, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left with 1 coin.
* Stall 2: price = 1, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins.

In this case, Alice buys exactly 3 jewels, which is the desired outcome.

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases and does not provide a correct solution for all inputs.
