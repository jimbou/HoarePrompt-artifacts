Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least -2 lines of input. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and this is printed: 1. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 is printed, and the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
