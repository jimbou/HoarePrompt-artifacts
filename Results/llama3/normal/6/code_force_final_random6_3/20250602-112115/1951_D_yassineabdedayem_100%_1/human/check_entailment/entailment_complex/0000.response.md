Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
2.  If `n` is not equal to `k` but `n + 2` is larger than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, which allows Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels and leaves her with 1 coin. The second stall has a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy 1 more jewel, resulting in a total of `k` jewels.
3.  If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each case.

Correctness: **True**
