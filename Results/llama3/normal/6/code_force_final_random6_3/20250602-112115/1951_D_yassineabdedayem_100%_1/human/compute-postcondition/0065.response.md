Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains at least `t - 1` lines of input. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is larger than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing for all the given input lines. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The variables `n` and `k` have been assigned values from the input. The standard input `stdin` contains at least `t - 1` lines of input, which have been processed by the loop. The output depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is larger than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
