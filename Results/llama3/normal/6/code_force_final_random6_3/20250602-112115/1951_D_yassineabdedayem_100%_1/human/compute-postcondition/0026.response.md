Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains at least -1 lines of input.**

In this output state, the values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input, which are split by spaces. The stdin now contains at least -1 lines of input, meaning one line has been consumed by the `readline()` function.
