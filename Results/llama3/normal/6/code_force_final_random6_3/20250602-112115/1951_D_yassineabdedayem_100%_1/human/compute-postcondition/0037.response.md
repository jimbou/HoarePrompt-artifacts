Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `n` and `k` are integers assigned from the input, which means their values are not explicitly known. However, we can describe their values using the given information.
* The expression `n - k + 1` is evaluated, which means we are subtracting `k` from `n` and then adding 1 to the result.
* The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space character will be printed after the expression `n - k + 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `n - k + 1`, followed by a space character.

Output: **[n - k + 1] (where n and k are integers assigned from the input)**
