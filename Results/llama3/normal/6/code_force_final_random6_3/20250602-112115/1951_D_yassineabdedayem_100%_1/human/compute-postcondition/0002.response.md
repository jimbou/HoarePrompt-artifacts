Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least 0 lines of input**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, which are obtained using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. The stdin now contains at least 0 lines of input, as one line has been read.
