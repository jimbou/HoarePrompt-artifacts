This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and t pairs of positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) as input. For each test case, it checks the relationship between n and k, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If 'YES', it also prints additional information: 1 if n equals k, or 2 followed by the difference between n and k plus 1 and 1 if n + 2 is larger than k * 2. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.
