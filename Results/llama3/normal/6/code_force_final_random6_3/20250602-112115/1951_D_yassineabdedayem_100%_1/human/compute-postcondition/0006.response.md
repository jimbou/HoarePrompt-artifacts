Based on the initial state, the code `print(1)` will simply print the number 1.

Here's the explanation:

* `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `_` is 0, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `n` and `k` are integers with the current value of `n` being equal to `k`, but their values are not used in the print statement.
* stdin contains at least 0 lines of input, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* 'YES' is printed, but this is not related to the print statement `print(1)`.

Since the print statement only contains the literal value 1, the output will be exactly that.

Output: **1**
