Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (k) as input.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

If n is not equal to k, the program checks if n + 2 is greater than k * 2. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of n - k + 1, which allows Alice to buy some jewels and be left with k - 1 coins. The second stall has a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining k - 1 jewels.

If n + 2 is not greater than k * 2, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
