To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least 0 lines of input.**
