Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the two base cases where n equals k and where n + 2 is larger than k * 2. In the first case, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels. In the second case, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls, one with a price of n - k + 1 and the other with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

The program also correctly handles the case where n + 2 is not larger than k * 2, in which case it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
