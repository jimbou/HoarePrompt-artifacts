The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the positive integer from the first line of the input. The remaining lines of the input are still in the stdin, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18).**
