The code `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least -2 lines of input.**

In this output state, the values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are now integers, assigned from the input. The stdin still contains at least -2 lines of input, since one line has been read and processed.
