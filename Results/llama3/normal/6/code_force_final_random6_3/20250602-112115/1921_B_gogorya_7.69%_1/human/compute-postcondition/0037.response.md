The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains unchanged. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
