Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `a1 - a2` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `n`, and `i` is 2. If `hd` is greater than 0, then `hd` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `hd`, `res`, `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
