The `print(res)` statement will print the calculated result, which is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in strings `s1` and `s2` plus the number of times `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for `i` in range `n`.

Since the exact values of `s1` and `s2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2 plus the number of times s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' for i in range n**
