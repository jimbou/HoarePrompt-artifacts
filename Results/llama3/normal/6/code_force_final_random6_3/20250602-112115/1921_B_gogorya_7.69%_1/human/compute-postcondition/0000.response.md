The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. So, `t` is assigned the value of this integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by two strings `s` and `f` of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by two strings `s` and `f` of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
