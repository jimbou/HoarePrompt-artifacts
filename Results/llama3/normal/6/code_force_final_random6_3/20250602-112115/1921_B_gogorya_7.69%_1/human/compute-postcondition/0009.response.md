Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer greater than 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, stdin is empty, and i is 0. If s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', then res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
