Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, stdin is empty, and i is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If the current value of `s1` at index `i` is '1' and the current value of `s2` at index `i` is '0', then `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains unchanged. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, n is an integer greater than 2, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s2, stdin is empty, i is 2. If hd is greater than 0, hd is an integer equal to hd - 1. If s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1. If hd is not greater than 0, hd and res remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
