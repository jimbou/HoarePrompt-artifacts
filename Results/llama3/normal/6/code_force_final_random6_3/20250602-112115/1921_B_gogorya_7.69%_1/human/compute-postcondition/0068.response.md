Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in two input strings and adds the number of positions where the first string has '1' and the second string has '0'. The function does not modify the input strings or any external state, and its only output is the calculated result for each test case, printed to the console.**
