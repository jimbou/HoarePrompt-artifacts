Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer greater than 2, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 if hd is not greater than 0 and s1[i] is not '1' and s2[i] is not '0', otherwise hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, i is 2, and stdin is empty. If hd > 0, the program executes the if part, otherwise it does nothing.***
