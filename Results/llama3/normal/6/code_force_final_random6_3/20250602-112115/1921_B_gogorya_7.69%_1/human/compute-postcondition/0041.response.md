Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is an integer greater than 2, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s2, stdin is empty, i is 2. If hd is greater than 0, hd is an integer equal to hd - 1. If s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1. If hd is not greater than 0, hd and res remain unchanged.***
