Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `hd` is not greater than 0 and `s1[i]` is not '1' and `s2[i]` is not '0', otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2, `i` is 2, and stdin is empty. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `res` and `hd` remain unchanged.***
