State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1` - `a2` - min(`n`, max(`a1` - `a2`, 0)), `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus the number of indices `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `stdin` is empty, and `i` is `n` - 1, and the value of `res` is being printed**
