#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by two strings s and f of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer equal to the integer value of the input, s1 is a string equal to the string value of the input, s2 is a string equal to the string value of the input, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s2, hd is an integer equal to 0, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of times s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' for i in range(n), stdin is empty, and _ is t, and res is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in two input strings and adds the number of positions where the first string has '1' and the second string has '0'. The function does not modify the input strings or any external state, and its only output is the calculated result for each test case, printed to the console.
