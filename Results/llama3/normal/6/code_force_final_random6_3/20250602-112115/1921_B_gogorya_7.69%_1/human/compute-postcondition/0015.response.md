The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1` - `a2` if `hd` is not greater than 0 and `s1[i]` is not '1' and `s2[i]` is not '0', otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1` - `a2` - 1, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `i` is 2, and `stdin` is empty.**
