The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2 and `_` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is `n` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n`.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - min(n, a1 - a2)`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus the number of indices `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' and `hd` is not greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and `_` is `n`**
