Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If the current value of `s1` at index `i` is '1' and the current value of `s2` at index `i` is '0', then `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
