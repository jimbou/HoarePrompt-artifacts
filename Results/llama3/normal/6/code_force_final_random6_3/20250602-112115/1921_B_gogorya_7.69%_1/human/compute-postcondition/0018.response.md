Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `hd` is not greater than 0 and `s1[i]` is not '1' and `s2[i]` is not '0', otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `i` is 2, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. The conditions for `hd` and `res` are still dependent on the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.
