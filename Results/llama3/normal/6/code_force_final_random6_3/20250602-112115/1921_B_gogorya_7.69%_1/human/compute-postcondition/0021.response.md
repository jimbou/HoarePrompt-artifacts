The code prints the value of `res`, which is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus the number of indices `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. 

Here, `a1` is the number of '1's in string `s1` and `a2` is the number of '1's in string `s2`. 

Since the exact values of `s1` and `s2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of indices i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0')**
