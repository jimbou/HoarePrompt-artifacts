Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly checks whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. If not, it prints a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

The program uses a sliding window approach to check for the occurrence of all possible strings of length n. It maintains a set of unique characters in the current window and checks if the size of the set is equal to k. If it is, it adds the current character to the answer and resets the window. If the length of the answer is greater than or equal to n, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

Correctness: **True**
