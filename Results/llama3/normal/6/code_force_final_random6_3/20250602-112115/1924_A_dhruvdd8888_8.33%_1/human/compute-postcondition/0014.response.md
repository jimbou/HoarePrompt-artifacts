Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set containing the third character of s, ans is a list containing the first two characters of s if the second character of s is in the set us, otherwise ans is a list containing the first character of s, ps is 2 if the second character of s is in the set us, otherwise ps is 1, and i is the third character in the string.**

In this output state, the only change is that the set win now contains the third character of the string s. The other variables remain unchanged. The set win was initially empty if the length of win was equal to k, but now it contains the third character of s. The rest of the variables, including stdin, n, k, m, s, us, ans, ps, and i, retain their original values and properties.
