To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in us:`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is an element of the set `us`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an element of `us`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `us`. Since `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, we can assume that the elements in `us` are in alphabetical order.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be the next alphabet in `us`.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 elements, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in the set `us` and appear in the string after the previous `k` characters in the list have appeared, `ps` is the number of times `k` characters in the set `us` have appeared in the string, and `i` is the next element in `us`**
