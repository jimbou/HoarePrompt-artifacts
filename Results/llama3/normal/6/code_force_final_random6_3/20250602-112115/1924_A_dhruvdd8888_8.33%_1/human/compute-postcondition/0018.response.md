Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in s that are in the set us and appear in the string after the previous k characters in the list have appeared, ps is the number of times k characters in the set us have appeared in the string, and i is the last character in the string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The loop iterates over each character in the string s. If the character is in the set us, it is added to the set win. If the length of win is equal to k, the last character added to win is appended to the list ans, the set win is cleared, and the counter ps is incremented. The loop continues until all characters in the string s have been processed. The final state of the variables is as described above.
