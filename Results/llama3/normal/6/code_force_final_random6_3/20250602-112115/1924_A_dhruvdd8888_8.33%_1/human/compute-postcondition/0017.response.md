Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the length of the set win is equal to k, then win is an empty set. If the third character of s is in the set us, then ans is a list containing the first two characters of s and the third character of s, and ps is 3. If the third character of s is not in the set us, then ans is a list containing the first character of s and the third character of s, and ps is 2. If the third character of s is not in the set us and the second character of s is in the set us, then ans is a list containing the first two characters of s, and ps is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
