To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `us`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `us` is not empty. Since `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element.

The state of `i` is not directly related to the loop execution, but we can adjust it to be an element of `us` to ensure the loop body can execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 element, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in s that are in the set us and appear in the string after the previous k characters in the list have appeared, ps is the number of times k characters in the set us have appeared in the string, and i is an element of us**
