Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in s that are in the set us and appear in the string after the previous k characters in the list have appeared, ps is the number of times k characters in the set us have appeared in the string, and i is the last character in the string. The number of times k characters in the set us have appeared in the string is less than n, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 element, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in s that are in the set us and appear in the string after the previous k characters in the list have appeared, ps is the number of times k characters in the set us have appeared in the string, and i is an element of us. If i is not in the set win, the program prints a string consisting of all the characters in s that are in the set us and appear in the string after the previous k characters in the list have appeared, followed by the character i and then 'a' repeated (n - len(ans) - 1) times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 elements, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in the set `us` and appear in the string after the previous `k` characters in the list have appeared, `ps` is the number of times `k` characters in the set `us` have appeared in the string, and `i` is an element of `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, a string is printed that is the concatenation of all characters in `ans` and the character `i` and 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 elements, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in the set `us` and appear in the string after the previous `k` characters in the list have appeared, `ps` is the number of times `k` characters in the set `us` have appeared in the string, and `i` is the next element in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, a string that is a combination of the characters in the list `ans` and the character `i` followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a's is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
