Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, if the length of win is equal to k, then win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the first character of s, ps is 1, and i is the first character in the string. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, if the length of win is equal to k, then win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the first two characters of s if the second character of s is in the set us, otherwise ans is a list containing the first character of s, ps is 2 if the second character of s is in the set us, otherwise ps is 1, and i is the second character in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the length of the set win is equal to k, then win is an empty set. If the third character of s is in the set us, then ans is a list containing the first two characters of s and the third character of s, and ps is 3. If the third character of s is not in the set us, then ans is a list containing the first character of s and the third character of s, and ps is 2. If the third character of s is not in the set us and the second character of s is in the set us, then ans is a list containing the first two characters of s, and ps is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
