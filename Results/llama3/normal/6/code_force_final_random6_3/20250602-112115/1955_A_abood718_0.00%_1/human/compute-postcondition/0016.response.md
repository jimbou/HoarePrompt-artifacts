Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial number of integers. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer value of `A` multiplied by `C` and divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of X multiplied by `C` plus `B` is printed, where X is half of `A` rounded down to the nearest whole number and `B` is a number such that `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`.***
