Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (C). If it is, then it prints the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, then it checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If it is, then it prints the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (A * C / 2).

If the number of yogurts is odd, then it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (X = A // 2), and then prints the total cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price (X * C) plus the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
