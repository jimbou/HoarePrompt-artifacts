Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial number of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as 0. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned integer values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin initially contains at least one integer, but after executing the code, it contains at least one integer less than the initial number of integers, since some integers have been consumed by the `input()` function.
