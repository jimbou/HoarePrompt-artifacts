Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes three integers as input: n (the number of yogurts), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

The program first checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than the price of two yogurts on promotion (b). If this condition is true, it means that buying yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so the program prints the total cost as n * a.

If the condition is false, the program checks if the number of yogurts (n) is even. If n is even, it means that Maxim can buy all yogurts at the promotion price, so the program prints the total cost as n * b / 2.

If n is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (n // 2), and then adds the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B). However, there is an error in this part of the program. The correct calculation should be (n // 2) * C + B, not just printing the value of (n // 2) and then (n // 2) * C + B.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
