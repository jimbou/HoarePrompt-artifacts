Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost based on the given conditions.

1. If the price of one yogurt (B) is less than half of the promotion price for two yogurts (C), it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the regular price. In this case, the program correctly prints the product of the number of yogurts (A) and the price of one yogurt (B).

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program correctly prints the integer part of the product of the number of yogurts (A) and the promotion price (C) divided by 2.

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, the program calculates the minimum cost by buying half of the yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price. However, there is a logical error in this part of the program. The program prints the half of A and then prints the product of the half and C plus B, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the product of the half and C plus B, without printing the half of A.

Correctness: **False**
