Output: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial number of integers, and `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`. The current value of `A` is an even integer, and the value of `A` multiplied by `C` and divided by 2 is being printed, which is an integer value because the result of the division is explicitly converted to an integer.**
