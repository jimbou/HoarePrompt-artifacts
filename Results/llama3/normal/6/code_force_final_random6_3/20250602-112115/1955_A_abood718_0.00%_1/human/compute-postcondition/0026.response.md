The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`. 

`X` is half of `A`, where `A` is the first integer from stdin. 
`C` is the third integer from stdin, and 
`B` is the second integer from stdin.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`.

Output: **X * C + B (where X is half of the first integer from stdin, C is the third integer from stdin, and B is the second integer from stdin)**
