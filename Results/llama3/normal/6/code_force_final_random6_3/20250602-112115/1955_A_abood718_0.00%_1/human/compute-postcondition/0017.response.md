The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the number of integers in `stdin`. If `i` is less than the number of integers in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains at least one integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `stdin` must contain at least two integers.

State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains at least two integers. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer value of `A` multiplied by `C` and divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of X multiplied by `C` plus `B` is printed, where X is half of `A` rounded down to the nearest whole number and `B` is a number such that `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`.**
