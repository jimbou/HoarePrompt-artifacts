Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying n yogurts. In the case where A is odd and B * 2 < C, the program should calculate the cost as (A // 2) * C + B, but it only prints (A // 2) and then (A // 2) * C + B, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is "3 5 11", the program should output "15", but it outputs "1" and then "15", which is incorrect.
