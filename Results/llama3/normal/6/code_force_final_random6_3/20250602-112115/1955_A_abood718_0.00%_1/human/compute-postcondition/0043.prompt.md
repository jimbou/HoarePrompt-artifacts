Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X)
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial number of integers. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer value of `A` multiplied by `C` and divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of X multiplied by `C` plus `B` is printed, where X is half of `A` rounded down to the nearest whole number and `B` is a number such that `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, stdin contains at least one integer. If `B` * 2 < `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` * 2 >= `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, half of `A` is printed, and the expression `X` * `C` + `B` is printed, where `X` is half of `A`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, stdin contains at least two integers. If `B * 2 < C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, half of `A` is calculated and stored in `X`, and then `X * C + B` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
