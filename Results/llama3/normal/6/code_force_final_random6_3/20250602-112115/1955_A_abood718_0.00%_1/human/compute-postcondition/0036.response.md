Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, `X` is half of `A`, stdin contains at least two integers.**

In this output state, the value of `X` is half of `A`, which is the first integer from stdin. The values of `i`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least two integers.
