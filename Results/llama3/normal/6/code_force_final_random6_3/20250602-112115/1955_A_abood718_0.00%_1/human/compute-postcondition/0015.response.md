Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial number of integers, and `B` multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to `C`. If `A` is even, the value of `A` multiplied by `C` and divided by 2 is printed, which is an integer value because the result of the division is explicitly converted to an integer. If `A` is odd, the integer X which is half of the odd number A rounded down to the nearest whole number is printed, and this is printed: X * C + B, where X is half of A rounded down to the nearest whole number and B is a number such that B multiplied by 2 is larger than or equal to C.***
