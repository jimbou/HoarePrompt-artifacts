The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: A, B, and C. For each case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: if B is less than half of C, it prints the product of A and B; if A is even, it prints the integer part of the product of A and C divided by 2; if A is odd, it calculates half of A, prints it, and then prints the product of the half and C plus B. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.
