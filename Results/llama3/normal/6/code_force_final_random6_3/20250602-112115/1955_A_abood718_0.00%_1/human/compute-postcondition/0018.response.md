Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, stdin contains at least one integer.**

The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` assigns the first three integers from the input to `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains at least one integer. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the input values.
