The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of integers in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and stdin must contain at least two integers.
State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, stdin contains at least two integers.**
