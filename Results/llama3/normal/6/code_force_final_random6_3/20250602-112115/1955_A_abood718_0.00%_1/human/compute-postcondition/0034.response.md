Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from stdin, with `A` being the first integer, `B` being the second integer, and `C` being the third integer.
* The expression `A * C / 2` is evaluated, which multiplies `A` and `C` and then divides the result by 2.
* The result of the expression is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
* The resulting integer is printed.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression.

Output: **the integer result of (A * C / 2) (where A is the first integer from stdin, C is the third integer from stdin)**
