Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, stdin contains at least one integer. If `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, half of `A` is printed, and the expression `X * C + B` is printed, where `X` is half of `A`.***
