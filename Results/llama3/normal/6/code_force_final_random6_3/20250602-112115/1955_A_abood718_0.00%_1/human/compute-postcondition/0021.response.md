The code prints the result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`, which is an integer value.

The value of `A` is the first integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, and `B` is the second integer from stdin.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression.

Output: **an integer value equal to the integer part of the result of (A * C / 2) (where A is the first integer from stdin and C is the third integer from stdin)**
