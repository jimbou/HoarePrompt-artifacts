The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is half of the first integer from stdin (`A`), `C` is the third integer from stdin, and `B` is the second integer from stdin.

Since `X` is half of `A`, we can describe `X` as `A/2`. The expression `X * C` can be described as `(A/2) * C`, and adding `B` to this result gives us the final output.

Output: **(A/2) * C + B (where A is the first integer from stdin, C is the third integer from stdin, and B is the second integer from stdin)**
