Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules:

1. If the price of one yogurt (a) is less than half the price of two yogurts on promotion (b), it prints the product of n and a.
2. If n is even, it prints the integer part of the product of n and b divided by 2.
3. If n is odd, it calculates half of n, and then prints the product of the half and b plus a.

The program correctly implements these rules and handles all possible cases. However, there is a logical error in the program. In the case where n is odd, the program prints the value of X (half of n) before printing the final result. This is incorrect, as the problem statement only asks for the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend, not the number of yogurts he buys.

Correctness: **False**
