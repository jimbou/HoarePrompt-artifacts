Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, stdin contains at least two integers.**

The values of `A`, `B`, `C` are updated to the first three integers from stdin, and stdin now contains at least two integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
