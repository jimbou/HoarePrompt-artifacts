Output: ** `i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `A` is the first integer from stdin, `B` is the second integer from stdin, `C` is the third integer from stdin, `X` is half of `A`, stdin contains at least two integers, and half of the first integer from stdin which is `X` is being printed, and this is printed: `X * C + B` where `X` is half of `A` and `B` is the second integer from stdin and `C` is the third integer from stdin**
