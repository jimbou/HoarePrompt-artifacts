The input contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), where n is the number of distinct types of cards and k is the number of coins. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), representing the number of cards of type i initially available.
