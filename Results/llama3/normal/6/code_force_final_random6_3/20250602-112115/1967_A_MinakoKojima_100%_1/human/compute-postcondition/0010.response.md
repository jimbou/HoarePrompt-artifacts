Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of integers, res is n - 2, i is 0, ans is the smallest integer in a plus dif, k is k minus dif times i plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `k`, and `res`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif`, which is the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a`. The second line decrements `k` by the product of `dif` and `i + 1`. The third line decrements `res` by 1. The values of `ans_list`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
