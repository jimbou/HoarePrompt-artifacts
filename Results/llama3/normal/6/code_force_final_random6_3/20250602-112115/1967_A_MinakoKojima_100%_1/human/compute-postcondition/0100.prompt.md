Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, ans is a[0], res is n - 1, k is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, then `res` is `n - 1` plus `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is 0, then the program does not update `ans` and `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 0 or 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * 2`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)` and `k` is set to 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` equals 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `res` is either increased by 0 or decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
