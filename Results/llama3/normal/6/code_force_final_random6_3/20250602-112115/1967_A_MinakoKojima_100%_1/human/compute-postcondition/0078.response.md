Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * 2`, `res` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `dif` to it, which is the difference between the second and third elements of the sorted list `a`. The value of `k` has been decreased by twice the value of `dif`, since `i` is 1. The value of `res` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
