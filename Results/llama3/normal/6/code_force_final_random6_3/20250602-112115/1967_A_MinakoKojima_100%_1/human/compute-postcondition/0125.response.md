Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer, `i` is 0. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 0, then if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
