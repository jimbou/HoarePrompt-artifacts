Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`, and `res` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by subtracting 1 from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
