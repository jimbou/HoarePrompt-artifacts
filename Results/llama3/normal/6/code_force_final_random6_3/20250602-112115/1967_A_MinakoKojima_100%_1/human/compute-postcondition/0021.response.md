Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is 0, the function either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `ans` being the smallest integer in `a` and `res` being `n - 1`, or it updates `res` to `n - 2`, `i` to 0, `ans` to the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and `k` to `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
