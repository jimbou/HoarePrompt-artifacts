Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. The current value of `k` is 0. If `k` was previously greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then the current value of `res` is `n - 2`, `i` is 0, the current value of `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and the current value of `k` was `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the current value of `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, and the current value of `res` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The rest of the information from the precondition is still valid.
