Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is an integer increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 0, `res` is an integer decreased by 1 plus k % (i + 1). Otherwise, `res` is an integer plus k % (i + 1).**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated based on the value of `k % (i + 1)`. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 and then increased by `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise, it is only increased by `k % (i + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
