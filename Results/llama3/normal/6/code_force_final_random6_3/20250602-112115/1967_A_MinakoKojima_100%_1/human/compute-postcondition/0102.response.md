Output State: **ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, ans is the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the differences between consecutive elements of a plus k divided by n, res is the number of elements in a that are not equal to the maximum value plus the remainder of k divided by n, and the current value of k is not equal to 0.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans` and `res`. The first line adds the integer division of `k` by `n` to `ans`, effectively increasing the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the differences between consecutive elements of `a`. The second line adds the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to `res`, effectively increasing the number of elements in `a` that are not equal to the maximum value. The values of `ans_list`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
