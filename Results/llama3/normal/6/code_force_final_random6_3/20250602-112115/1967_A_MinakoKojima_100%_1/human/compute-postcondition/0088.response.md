The value of `dif` is updated to `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `i + 1` is either 2 or 3. So, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `a[2] - a[1]` is the difference between the second and first elements, and `a[3] - a[2]` is the difference between the third and second elements. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`.**
