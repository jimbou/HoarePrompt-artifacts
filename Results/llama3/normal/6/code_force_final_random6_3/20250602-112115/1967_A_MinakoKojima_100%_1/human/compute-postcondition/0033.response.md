Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n - 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the product of the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of `a` and `n`, then `ans` is increased by this difference, `k` is decreased by the product of this difference and `n`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `res` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
