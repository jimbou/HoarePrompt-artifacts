Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the new variable `dif`, which is assigned the difference between the second smallest integer in the sorted list `a` and the smallest integer in `a`.
