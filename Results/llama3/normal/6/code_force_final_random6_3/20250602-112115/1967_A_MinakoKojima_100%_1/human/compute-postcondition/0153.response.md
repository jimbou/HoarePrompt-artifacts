Postcondition: **ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, i is n - 1, dif is the difference between the last and second last elements of a. If dif is 0, res is an integer decreased by n - 1. Otherwise, if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), ans is increased by dif, k is decreased by dif * (i + 1), and res is decreased by n - 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by k // (i + 1), k is set to 0, and if dif is 0, res is decreased by n - 1 plus k % (i + 1), otherwise res is increased by k % (i + 1) minus n + 1. The current value of k is not 0.**
