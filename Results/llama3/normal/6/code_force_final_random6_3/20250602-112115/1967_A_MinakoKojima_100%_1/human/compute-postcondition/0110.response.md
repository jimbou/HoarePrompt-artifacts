Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer decreased by 1, `i` is 0, the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` still contains the updated value of `ans`. The variable `_` remains 0. The integer `n` is still at least 2. The list `a` is still sorted and the difference between its second and first elements is 0. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. The integer `k` and `ans` remain unchanged. The integer `res` has been decreased by 1. The variable `i` is still 0.
