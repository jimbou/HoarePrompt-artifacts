Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` equals 0, `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still either 1 or 2, and the value of `dif` is still either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` equals 0, `res` is still decreased by 1. The list `a` is still sorted, and `n` is still at least 3. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus 2 test cases.
