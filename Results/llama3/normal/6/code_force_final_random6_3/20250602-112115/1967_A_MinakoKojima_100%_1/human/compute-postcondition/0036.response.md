Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`**

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the element at index `n+1` and the element at index `n` in the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
