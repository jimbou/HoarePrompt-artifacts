Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the integers, calculating a value 'ans' based on the differences between consecutive integers and the value of k, and appending this value to a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated values for each test case.**
