Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 0 or 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * 2`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)` and `k` is set to 0.***
