Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `k` is unchanged, `res` is decreased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans_list` is still empty, `_` is still 0, `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `a` is still a sorted list of integers, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is still `n - 1`, `dif` is still `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, and `k` is still unchanged.
