Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`. If `dif` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
