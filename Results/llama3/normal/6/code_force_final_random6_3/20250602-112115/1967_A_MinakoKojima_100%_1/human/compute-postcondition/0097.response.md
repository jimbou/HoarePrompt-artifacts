Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `ans_list` still contains the updated value of `ans`, and the other variables maintain their initial values and conditions.
