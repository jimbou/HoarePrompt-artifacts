Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second element and the first element of `a`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` still contains the updated value of `ans`. The variable `_` remains 0. The integer `n` is still at least 2. The list `a` is still sorted. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. The integer `k` and `ans` and `res` are unchanged. The variable `i` is still 0. A new variable `dif` is introduced, which is the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `a`.
