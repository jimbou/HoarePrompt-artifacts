To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is either 0 or 1. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be either 1 or 2.

The only other variable in the loop head is `n`, which is at least 3. Since `n` is not modified within the loop, its state remains the same.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`.**
