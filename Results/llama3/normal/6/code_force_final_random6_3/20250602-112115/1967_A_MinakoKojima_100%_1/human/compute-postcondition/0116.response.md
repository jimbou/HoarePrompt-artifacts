Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer and equals to `ans + k // (i + 1)`, `res` is an integer, `i` is 0, the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 0, the current value of `res` is not decreased by 1, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `k // (i + 1)`, where `k` is an integer and `i` is 0. The rest of the conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
