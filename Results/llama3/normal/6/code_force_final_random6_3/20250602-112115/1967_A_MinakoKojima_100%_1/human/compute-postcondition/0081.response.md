Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`.***
