Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the second element (`a[i + 1]`) and the first element (`a[i]`) of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` is at least 2 and `a` is a sorted list of integers still holds.
