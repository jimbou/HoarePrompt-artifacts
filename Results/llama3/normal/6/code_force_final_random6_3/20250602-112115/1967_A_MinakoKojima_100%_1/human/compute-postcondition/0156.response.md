Output State: **ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, i is n - 1, dif is the difference between the last and second last elements of a, res is an integer, k is 0, ans is increased by (ans - 1) * (n - 1) plus res**

The code block modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` to it, and then adds the value of `res` to `ans`. The updated value of `ans` is then appended to `ans_list`. The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `dif`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is not explicitly modified in the code block, but its value is used to update `ans`. The value of `_` remains 0. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases.
