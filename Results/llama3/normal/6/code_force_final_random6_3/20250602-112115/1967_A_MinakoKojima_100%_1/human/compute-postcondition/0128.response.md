The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `res`, we can only conclude that the value of `res` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer decreased by 1, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`.**
