Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`**

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list `a`, since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `ans_list` still containing the updated value of `ans`, `_` still being 1, `n` still being at least 3, `a` still being a sorted list of integers, `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, and `i` still being 1.
