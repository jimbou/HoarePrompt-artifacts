Output State: **ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, ans is an integer increased by dif, i is 1, dif is the difference between the second and first elements of a, k is decreased by dif * (i + 1), res is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between the second and first elements of `a` (denoted as `dif`). The value of `k` has been decreased by the product of `dif` and `(i + 1)`, where `i` is 1. The value of `res` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
