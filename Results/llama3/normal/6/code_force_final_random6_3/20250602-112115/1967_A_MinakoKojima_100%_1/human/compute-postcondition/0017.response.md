Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is `n - 2`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and `k` is `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, and `res` is `n - 1`.***
