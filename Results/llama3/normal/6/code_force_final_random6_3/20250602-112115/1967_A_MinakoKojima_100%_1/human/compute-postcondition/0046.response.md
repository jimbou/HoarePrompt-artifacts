Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (n + 1)`, and `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (n + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (n + 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
