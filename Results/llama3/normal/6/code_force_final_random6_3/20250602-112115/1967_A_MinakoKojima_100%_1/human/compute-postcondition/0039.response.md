Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, i is n, dif is a[n + 1] - a[n], ans is dif, k is k - dif * (n + 1), res is res - 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `k`, and `res`. The value of `ans` is incremented by `dif`, which is the difference between the elements at indices `n+1` and `n` in the sorted list `a`. The value of `k` is decremented by the product of `dif` and `n+1`, where `n` is the current value of `i`. The value of `res` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
