Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, if `i` is not 0, then `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer, the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, meaning `dif` is not equal to 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`***
