Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, `k` is an integer, the current value of `i` is not 0, the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, meaning `dif` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, where `k % (i + 1)` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
