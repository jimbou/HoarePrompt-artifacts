The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`. But this is impossible because `n` cannot be greater than itself. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`**
