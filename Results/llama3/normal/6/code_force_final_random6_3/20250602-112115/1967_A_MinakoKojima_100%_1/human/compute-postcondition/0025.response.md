Postcondition: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `k` is unchanged, if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
