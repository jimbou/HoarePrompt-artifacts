Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is 0. The difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0, and the current value of `res` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to its initial value, which was the smallest integer in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a`, the value of `res`, and the relationship between `k` and `dif * (i + 1)` are still valid.
