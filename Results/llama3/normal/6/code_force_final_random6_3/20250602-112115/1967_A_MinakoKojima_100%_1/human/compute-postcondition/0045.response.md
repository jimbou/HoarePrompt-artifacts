Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (n + 1)`, and `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (n + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (n + 1)`, and `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
