Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `k` is unchanged, `res` is increased by `k % n`, `ans` is increased by `k // n`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `k % (i + 1)`, which is equivalent to `k % n` since `i` is equal to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
