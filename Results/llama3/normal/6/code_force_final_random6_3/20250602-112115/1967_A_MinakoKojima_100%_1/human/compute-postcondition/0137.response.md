Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 plus `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
