Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is an integer, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 0, `res` is an integer decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
