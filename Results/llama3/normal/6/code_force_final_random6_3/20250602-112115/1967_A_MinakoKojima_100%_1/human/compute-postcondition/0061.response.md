Postcondition: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, meaning `dif` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `dif` and `i + 1`.**
