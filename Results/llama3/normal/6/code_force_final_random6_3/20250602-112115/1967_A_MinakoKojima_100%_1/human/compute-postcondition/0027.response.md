Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `k` is unchanged, if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `k // (n - 1 + 1)` which is `k // n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` is still empty, the variable `_` remains 0, the integer `n` is still greater than 1, the list `a` is still sorted, there are still multiple test cases minus 1 in `stdin`, the variable `i` is still `n - 1`, the difference `dif` is still `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, the variable `k` is unchanged, the value of `res` is still decreased by 1 if `dif` is 0, otherwise it remains the same, and the variable `ans` has been increased by the integer division of `k` by `n`.
