Postcondition: ***ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. If k is not equal to 0, ans is the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the differences between consecutive elements of a plus k divided by n, res is the number of elements in a that are not equal to the maximum value plus the remainder of k divided by n. Otherwise, ans is the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the differences between consecutive elements of a, res is the number of elements in a that are not equal to the maximum value.***
