The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. However, the initial state does not mention the variable `res`. It only mentions the variables `ans_list`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `i`, and `dif`. Since `res` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its initial value or how it changes.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes.

Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`.**
