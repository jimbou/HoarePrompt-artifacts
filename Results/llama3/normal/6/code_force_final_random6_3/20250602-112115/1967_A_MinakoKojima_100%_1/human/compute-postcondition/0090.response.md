Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` equals 0, `res` is decreased by 1.***
