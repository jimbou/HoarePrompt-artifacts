Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`, `ans` is increased by `k // (n + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (n + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the remainder of `k` divided by `n + 1` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
