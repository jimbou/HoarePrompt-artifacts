Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. If `i` is not equal to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `k` is unchanged, `res` is increased by `k % n`, `ans` is increased by `k // n`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
