To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. Also, `i` is not defined before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0**
