Output State: **ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 1, n is at least 3, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, i is either 1 or 2, dif is either a[2] - a[1] or a[3] - a[2], ans is increased by dif, k is decreased by dif * (i + 1), res is decreased by 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `k`, and `res`. The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `dif`, which is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. The value of `k` is decreased by the product of `dif` and `(i + 1)`, where `i` is either 1 or 2. The value of `res` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
