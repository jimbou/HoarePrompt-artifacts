Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is 0, the function either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `ans` being the smallest integer in `a` and `res` being `n - 1`, or it updates `res` to `n - 2`, `i` to 0, `ans` to the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and `k` to `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to the product of the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of `a` and `n`, then `ans` is increased by this difference, `k` is decreased by the product of this difference and `n`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `res` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is `n`, `dif` is `a[n + 1] - a[n]`. If `dif` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (n + 1)`, and `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (n + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (n + 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
