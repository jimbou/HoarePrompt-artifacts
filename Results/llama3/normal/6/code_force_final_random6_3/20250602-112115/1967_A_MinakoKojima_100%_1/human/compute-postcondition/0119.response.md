Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `k` is an integer, `res` is an integer, the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, then `ans` is an integer and equals to `ans + k // (i + 1)`, and `res` is an integer and equals to `res + k % (i + 1)`.***
