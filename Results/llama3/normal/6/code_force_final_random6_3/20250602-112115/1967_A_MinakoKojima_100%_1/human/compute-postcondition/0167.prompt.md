Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list contains the updated values of ans after all test cases have been processed, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, ans is the updated value after adding (ans - 1) * (n - 1) and res for the last test case, res is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise no changes are made for the last test case.
Code of the loop:
for a in ans_list:
    print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans_list contains the updated values of ans after all test cases have been processed and must have at least 1 element, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is the first element in the list, stdin is empty, ans is the updated value after adding (ans - 1) * (n - 1) and res for the last test case, res is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise no changes are made for the last test case, and the first element of the list which is a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans_list` contains the updated values of ans after all test cases have been processed and must have at least 2 elements, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is the second element in the list, stdin is empty, ans is the updated value after adding (ans - 1) * (n - 1) and res for the last test case, res is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise no changes are made for the last test case, and the first element of the list which is a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans_list` contains the updated values of ans after all test cases have been processed and must have at least 3 elements, `_` is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is the third element in the list, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the updated value after adding (ans - 1) * (n - 1) and res for the last test case, `res` is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise no changes are made for the last test case, and the third element of the list which is [a] is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
