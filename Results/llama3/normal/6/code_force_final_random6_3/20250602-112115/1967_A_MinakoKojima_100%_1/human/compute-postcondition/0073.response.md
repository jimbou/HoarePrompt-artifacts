Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, then `res` is `n - 1` plus `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is 0, then the program does not update `ans` and `res`***
