Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` is either `a[2] - a[1]` or `a[3] - a[2]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `res` is either increased by 0 or decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 0.***
