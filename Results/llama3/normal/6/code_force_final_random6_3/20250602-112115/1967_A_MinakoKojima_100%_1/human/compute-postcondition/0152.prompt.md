Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is an integer, res is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer, `i` is 0. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 0, then if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is an integer decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 plus `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and second elements of `a`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is an integer decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 2 plus `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)` minus 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
