Postcondition: ***ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. If k is not equal to 0, ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k divided by n, and res is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
