Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
