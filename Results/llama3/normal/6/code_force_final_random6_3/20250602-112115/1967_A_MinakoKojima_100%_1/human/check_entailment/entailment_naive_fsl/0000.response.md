Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be obtained. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of subarrays that can be formed with the given cards.

In the program, it first sorts the cards in ascending order and then tries to make the number of cards of each type equal by buying more cards. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to rearrange the cards to maximize the score.

For example, consider the case where n = 3, k = 4, and the initial cards are [6, 1, 8]. The program will sort the cards to [1, 6, 8] and then try to make the number of cards of each type equal by buying more cards. However, this approach will not result in the maximum score.

A correct approach would be to first find the minimum number of cards of each type that can be used to form a subarray of length n, and then use the remaining cards to form as many subarrays as possible. This approach would result in a higher score than the program's approach.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
