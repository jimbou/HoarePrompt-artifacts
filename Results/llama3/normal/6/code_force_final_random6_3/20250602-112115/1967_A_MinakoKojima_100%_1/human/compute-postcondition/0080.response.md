Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` still contains the updated value of `ans`. The variable `_` remains 1. The value of `n` is still at least 3. The list `a` is still sorted. There are multiple test cases minus 2 test cases in `stdin`. The variable `i` is still 1. The difference `dif` is still `a[2] - a[1]`. The value of `res` has been increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. If `dif` is 0, `res` was previously decreased by 1, and `ans` was increased by the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`.
