Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is not 0. The difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` is still empty, the variable `_` remains 0, and the integer `n` is still greater than 1. The integer `k` and the sorted list of integers `a` also remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`. The value of `res` has been updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case. The value of `i` is still not 0. Additionally, the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is still not 0, and `k` is still less than `dif * (i + 1)`.
