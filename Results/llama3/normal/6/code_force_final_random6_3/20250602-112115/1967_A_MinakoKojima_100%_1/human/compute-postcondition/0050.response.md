Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is a non-zero integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k divided by n, res is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by `k` divided by `n`, and the value of `res` has been incremented by `k` modulo `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
