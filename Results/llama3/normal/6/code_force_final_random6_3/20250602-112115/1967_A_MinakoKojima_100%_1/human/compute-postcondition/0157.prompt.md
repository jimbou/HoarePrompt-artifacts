Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, ans is the updated value after adding (ans - 1) * (n - 1) and res, res is n - 1 minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in a that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus k modulo n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. If k is not equal to 0, ans is the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the differences between consecutive elements of a plus k divided by n, plus the product of (ans - 1) and (n - 1), plus the number of elements in a that are not equal to the maximum value plus the remainder of k divided by n. Otherwise, ans is the maximum value that can be obtained by adding the differences between consecutive elements of a, plus the product of (ans - 1) and (n - 1), plus the number of elements in a that are not equal to the maximum value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, i is n - 1, dif is the difference between the last and second last elements of a, res is an integer, k is 0, ans is increased by (ans - 1) * (n - 1) plus res




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
