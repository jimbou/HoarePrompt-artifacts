Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, `dif` is 0, and the difference between the first two elements of `a` is 0, meaning the first two elements of `a` are equal.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `n - 2` by subtracting 1 from its previous value of `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
