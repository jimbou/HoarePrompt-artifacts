Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case, `i` is 0. The difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0, and the current value of `res` is `n - 1`. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the product of the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` and the value of `i` plus 1.***
