Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `res` is an integer, `i` is 0, the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 0. If `k` was greater than or equal to the product of `dif` and the sum of `i` and 1, then `ans` was increased by `dif` and `res` was decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` was set to 0. The current value of `k` is 0.***
