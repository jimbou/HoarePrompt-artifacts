Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case.**

Explanation: The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, assigns it to `a`, and sorts it in ascending order. The third line assigns the smallest integer in `a` (which is now sorted) to `ans`. The fourth line assigns the value of `n - 1` to `res`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0, and `ans_list` remains an empty list. Stdin now contains one less test case.
