Output State: **ans_list contains the updated value of ans, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is an integer, res is an integer.**

Here is the description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes and updates the state of the variables. The value of `ans_list` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `a` is updated to a sorted list of integers read from the input. The value of `stdin` is updated to contain multiple test cases minus 2 test cases. The value of `k` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `ans` is updated to the smallest integer in the sorted list `a`. The value of `res` is updated to `n - 1`.
