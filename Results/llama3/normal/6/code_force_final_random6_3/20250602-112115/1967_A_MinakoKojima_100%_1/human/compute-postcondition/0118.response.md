Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer and equals to `ans + k // (i + 1)`, `res` is an integer and equals to `res + k % (i + 1)`, `i` is not 0, the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` are still valid.
