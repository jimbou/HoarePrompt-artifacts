To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin` (which contains the input).

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 test case.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `stdin` needs to contain at least one more test case.

State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `ans` is the updated value after adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and `res`, `res` is `n - 1` minus the number of differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are not equal to 0 and are less than or equal to `k` divided by the index of the element plus 1 plus `k` modulo `n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise no changes are made.**
