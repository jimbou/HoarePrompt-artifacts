Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 plus `k % (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
