Output State: **`ans_list` contains the updated value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `i` is either 0 or 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * 2`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)` and `k` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The rest of the conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
