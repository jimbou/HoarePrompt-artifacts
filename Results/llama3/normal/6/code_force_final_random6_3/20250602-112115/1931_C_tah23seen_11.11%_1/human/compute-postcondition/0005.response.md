The code `break` breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. The element at index `i` of `arr` is still not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`. The values of `i` and `j` are still 0 and greater than or equal to 0, respectively.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
