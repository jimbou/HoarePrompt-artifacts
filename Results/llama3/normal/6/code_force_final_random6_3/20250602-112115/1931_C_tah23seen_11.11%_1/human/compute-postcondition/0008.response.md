Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `j` has been decremented by 1. The relationship between the elements of `arr` at indices `i` and `j` remains the same, but the indices themselves have changed. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid, as the code does not modify any other variables or the structure of `arr`.
