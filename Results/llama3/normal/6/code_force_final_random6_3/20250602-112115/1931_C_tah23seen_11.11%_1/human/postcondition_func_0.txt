This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the length of the longest subarray with consecutive equal elements. If no such subarray exists, it returns 0. The function iterates through the list from both ends, comparing elements and moving towards the center. If it finds a pair of equal elements, it counts the consecutive equal elements and returns the count. If it reaches the end of the list without finding a pair of equal elements, it returns 0.
