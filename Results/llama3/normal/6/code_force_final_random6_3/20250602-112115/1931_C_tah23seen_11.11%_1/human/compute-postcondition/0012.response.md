Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `j` has been decremented by 1. The relationship between the elements of `arr` at indices `i` and `j` remains the same, but the specific values of `i` and `j` have changed. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid.
