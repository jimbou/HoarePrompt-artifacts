According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr` and `i`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` is increased by 1. `i` being less than the length of `arr` minus 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 2, `i` is increased by 1**
