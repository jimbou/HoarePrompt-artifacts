Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the array is already sorted in a way that the operation is not needed (i.e., all elements are equal), and if not, it tries to find the longest prefix of equal elements and the longest suffix of equal elements. The idea is to replace all elements between these two parts with the value of the prefix or suffix.

However, the program has several issues:

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It only checks if the array is already sorted in a way that the operation is not needed, but it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has only one element.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has two elements.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has more than two elements and the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements do not overlap.

5. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

6. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has duplicate elements.

7. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has elements that are not equal to the first or last element.

8. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has elements that are equal to the first or last element but are not part of the longest prefix or suffix.

Correctness: **False**
