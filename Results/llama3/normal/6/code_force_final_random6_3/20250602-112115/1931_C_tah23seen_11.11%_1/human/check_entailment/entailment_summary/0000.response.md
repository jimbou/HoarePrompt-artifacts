Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal. However, the function does not correctly implement this logic. It seems to be checking for the longest subarray with consecutive equal elements, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

The function iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements and moving towards the center. If it finds a pair of equal elements, it counts the consecutive equal elements and returns the count. However, this approach does not consider the cost of making all elements equal, which is the main requirement of the problem.

For example, in the test case [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the function returns 4, but the correct answer is 5. This is because the function is only considering the longest subarray with consecutive equal elements, which is [1, 1] with a length of 2, and then adding 2 to it (j - i + 1). However, this does not take into account the cost of making all elements equal, which would require changing all elements to 1, resulting in a cost of 5.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
