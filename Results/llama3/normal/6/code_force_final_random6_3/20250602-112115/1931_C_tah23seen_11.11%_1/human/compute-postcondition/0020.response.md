The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `arr` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1. After incrementing `i` by 1, the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `arr` are still equal, and `i` is still less than the length of `arr` minus 1. The length of `arr` and the elements in `arr` are not affected.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` is increased by 1**
