Output State: **The program returns the difference between the last index of the list `arr` and the index `i`, where `i` is the index of the last pair of equal elements in the list, and the last index of `arr` is the length of `arr` minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` is the last index of the list `arr`, which is the length of `arr` minus 1. The value of `i` is the index of the last pair of equal elements in the list, which is less than the length of `arr` minus 1. The program returns the difference between these two indices, which represents the number of elements in the list after the last pair of equal elements.
