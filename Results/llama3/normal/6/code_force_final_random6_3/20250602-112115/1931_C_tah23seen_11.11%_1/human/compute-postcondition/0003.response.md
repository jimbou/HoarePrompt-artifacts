Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, i is 1, j is less than or equal to its original value minus 1. The value of arr[i-1] is equal to the value of arr[j+1].**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `j` has been decremented by 1. The relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` has been maintained, with `arr[i-1]` being equal to `arr[j+1]`. The list `arr` remains unchanged, and its elements are still non-negative integers.
