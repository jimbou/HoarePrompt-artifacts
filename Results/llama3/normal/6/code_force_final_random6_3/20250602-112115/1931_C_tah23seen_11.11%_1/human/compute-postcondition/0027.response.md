Output State: **The program returns the number of elements in the subarray where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1.**

In this output state, `j - i + 1` represents the length of the subarray where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal. The value of `j` is not equal to the last index of `arr`, indicating that the subarray is a contiguous sequence of equal elements within the larger array `arr`. The value of `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, ensuring that the subarray has at least two elements.
