Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing, and the values of `i` and `j` have been updated accordingly. If the elements at indices `i` and `j` of `arr` are equal, then `i` has been incremented and `j` has been decremented, and the values of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[j+1]` are equal. If the elements at indices `i` and `j` of `arr` are not equal, then the loop has broken out, and the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
