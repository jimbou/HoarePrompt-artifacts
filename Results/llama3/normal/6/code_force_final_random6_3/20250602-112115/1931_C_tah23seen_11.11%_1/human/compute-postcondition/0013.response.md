Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables in the initial state are still valid, and no new variables have been introduced. The break statement only affects the control flow of the program, not the values of the variables.
