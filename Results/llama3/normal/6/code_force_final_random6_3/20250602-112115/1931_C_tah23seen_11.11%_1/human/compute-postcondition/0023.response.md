To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `arr` and `i` so that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Since `i` is increased by 2, we need to make sure that the elements at indices `i + 2` and `i + 3` are equal.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least four elements, where the elements at indices `i + 2` and `i + 3` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 3, `i` is increased by 2**
