The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `arr`. `j` being the last index of `arr` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 0**
