Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 2, `i` is increased by 2**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 more than its initial value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
