To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `j` so that `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.

According to the given state, if the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. This means that `j` can be any value greater than or equal to 0, as long as the condition `arr[i-1] == arr[j+1]` is satisfied.

However, if the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the current values of `i` and `j` do not satisfy the condition `arr[i-1] == arr[j+1]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `j` so that it is greater than or equal to `i`. Since `i` is 2, we can set `j` to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`.**
