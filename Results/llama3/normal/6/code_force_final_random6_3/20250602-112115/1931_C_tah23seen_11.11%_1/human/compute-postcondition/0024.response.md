Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least four elements, where the elements at indices `i + 2` and `i + 3` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 3, `i` is increased by 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now increased by 3 instead of 2. The other conditions and values remain the same.
