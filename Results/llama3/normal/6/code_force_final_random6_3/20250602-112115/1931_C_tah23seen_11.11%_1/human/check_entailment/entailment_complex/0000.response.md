Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" (a unit of cost) required to make all elements of an array equal by selecting three integers i, j, x and assigning all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles.

The function `func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the length of the longest subarray with consecutive equal elements. If no such subarray exists, it returns 0.

However, the problem statement requires finding the minimum number of burles to make all elements of the array equal, not the length of the longest subarray with consecutive equal elements.

The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks for consecutive equal elements from the ends of the array and returns the count of consecutive equal elements. It does not consider the case where the array can be made equal by assigning a value to a subarray that is not consecutive.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the function `func_1` will return 1, but the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal is 4 (by assigning the value 1 to the subarray [1, 2, 3, 4]).

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
