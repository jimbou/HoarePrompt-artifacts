Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then either `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`, or `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
