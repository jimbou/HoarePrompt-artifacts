Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will return 5, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 6, because we need to change all elements to the same value.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first and last elements are the same, and if they are not, it returns the difference between the indices of the last element and the first element that is not equal to the first element. However, this approach does not consider the case where the array has multiple segments of equal elements, and we need to change all elements to the same value.

To fix this issue, the program should iterate through the array and count the number of segments of equal elements. Then, it should return the minimum number of operations required to change all elements to the same value, which is the total number of elements minus the maximum length of a segment of equal elements.
