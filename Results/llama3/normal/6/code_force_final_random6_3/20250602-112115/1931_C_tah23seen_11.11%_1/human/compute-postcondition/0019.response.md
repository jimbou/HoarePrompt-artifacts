To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `arr` and `i` since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the loop condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, for the loop to execute, the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` of `arr` must be equal.

Given the state right before the loop:

* `arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
* If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `arr` and `i` as follows:

* `arr` must have at least two elements, and the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` must be equal.
* `i` must be less than the length of `arr` minus 1, to ensure that `i + 1` is a valid index.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1**
