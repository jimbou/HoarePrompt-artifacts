According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1. `j` being less than or equal to its original value minus 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
