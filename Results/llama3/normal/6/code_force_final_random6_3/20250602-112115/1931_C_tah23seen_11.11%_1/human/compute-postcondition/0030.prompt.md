You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. If the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `arr[i-1]` is equal to the value of `arr[j+1]`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executes.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the number of elements in the subarray where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executes. `j` is equal to the last index of `arr`
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the last index of the list `arr` and the index `i`, where `i` is the index of the last pair of equal elements in the list, and the last index of `arr` is the length of `arr` minus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the number of elements in the subarray where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between the last index of the list `arr` and the index `i`, where `i` is the index of the last pair of equal elements in the list, and the last index of `arr` is the length of `arr` minus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
