Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Otherwise, the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the length of the longest subarray with consecutive equal elements. If no such subarray exists, it returns 0. The function iterates through the list from both ends, comparing elements and moving towards the center. If it finds a pair of equal elements, it counts the consecutive equal elements and returns the count. If it reaches the end of the list without finding a pair of equal elements, it returns 0.
