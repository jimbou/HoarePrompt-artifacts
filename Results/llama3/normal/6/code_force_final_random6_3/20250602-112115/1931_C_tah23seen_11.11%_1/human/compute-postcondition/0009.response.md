Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. This does not affect the values of any variables, including `arr`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.
