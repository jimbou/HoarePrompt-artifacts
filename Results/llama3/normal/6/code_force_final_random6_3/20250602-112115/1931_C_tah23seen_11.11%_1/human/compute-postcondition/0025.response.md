Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, and `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executes.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` remains a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, where the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal. The value of `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executes, which means it will be equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
