Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function first checks if the array is already equal by comparing elements from the start and end of the array. If the array is already equal, it returns 0.

If the array is not equal, the function then checks for the longest sequence of equal elements from the start of the array. It does this by incrementing the index `i` until it finds a pair of unequal elements.

After finding the longest sequence of equal elements, the function checks if the last index `j` is equal to the last index of the array. If it is, the function returns the difference between the last index and the index `i`, which represents the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal.

If the last index `j` is not equal to the last index of the array, the function returns the difference between the last index `j` and the index `i` plus 1, which represents the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
