Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers that must have at least `t` elements, `total` is 45, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 45, `n` is the last element in the list, `word` is "45", `last` is 5, `remainder` is 4, `sum_total` is 15730481956924, and the value of `sum_values` at index `n` which is the last element in the list is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t and a list of t integers from standard input, calculates the sum of the digits of each integer in the list, and prints the sum of the digits of each integer. The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer, where the sum of the digits of an integer is calculated as the sum of the digits of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining digits. The function prints the sum of the digits of each integer in the list.
