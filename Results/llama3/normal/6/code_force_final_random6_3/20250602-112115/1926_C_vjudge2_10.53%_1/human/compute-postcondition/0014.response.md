Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, and the third element is 2, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, and the third element is 3, total is 3, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 2**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `numbers` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `values` has its third element updated to 2, as specified by the first line of the code. The list `sum_values` has its third element updated to 3, which is the new value of `total` after the second line of the code executes. The variable `total` is incremented by 2 (the value of `i`) and becomes 3. The variable `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` remains empty as it was initially empty and no input operations were performed.
