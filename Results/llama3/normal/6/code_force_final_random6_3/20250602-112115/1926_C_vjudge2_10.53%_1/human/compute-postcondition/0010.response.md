Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, total is 0, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 0**

The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of `values`, `total`, and `sum_values`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `values[i]`, making the first element of `values` equal to 0. The second line increments `total` by the value of `i`, which is 0, so `total` remains 0. The third line assigns the value of `total` to `sum_values[i]`, making the first element of `sum_values` equal to 0. The values of `t`, `numbers`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
