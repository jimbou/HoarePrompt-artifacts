The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the loop, which is 10. Since the range is fixed, the loop will always execute 10 times. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements, all initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements, all initialized to 0, `total` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
