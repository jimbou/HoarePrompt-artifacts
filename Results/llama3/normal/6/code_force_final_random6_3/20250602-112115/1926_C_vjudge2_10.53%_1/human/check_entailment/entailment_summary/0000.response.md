Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the loop where the program calculates the sum of the digits of each integer, it uses the line `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]`. This line is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the digits of an integer is equal to the sum of the digits of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining digits. This assumption is not true.

For example, if the integer is 123, the program would calculate the sum of its digits as `values[3] + values[12]`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation would be `1 + 2 + 3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
