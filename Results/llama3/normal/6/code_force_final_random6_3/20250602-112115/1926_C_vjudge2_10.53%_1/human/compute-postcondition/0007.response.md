Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, _ is t-1, stdin is empty**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of t will be between 0 and 10^4 inclusive (since it started between 1 and 10^4 and was decremented t times), the list numbers will contain t integers (since an integer was appended to it t times), the variable _ will be t-1 (since it was incremented t times and started at 0), and stdin will be empty (since all inputs were consumed by the loop).
