Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing two integers, _ is 1, stdin is empty**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. However, since stdin is empty in the initial state, this line will not execute and `n` will not be assigned a value. The second line appends `n` to the list `numbers`. Since `n` was not assigned a value, this line will also not execute and the list `numbers` will remain unchanged. The variable `t` and the variable `_` are not affected by the code block and remain unchanged.
