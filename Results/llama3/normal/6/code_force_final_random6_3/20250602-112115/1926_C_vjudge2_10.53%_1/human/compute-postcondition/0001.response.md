To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `_` is 0**
