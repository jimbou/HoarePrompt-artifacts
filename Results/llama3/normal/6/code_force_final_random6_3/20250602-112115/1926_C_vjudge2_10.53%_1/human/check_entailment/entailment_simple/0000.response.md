Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.

The program first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of the digits of each number and the cumulative sum of these sums, respectively. It then calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to n and stores it in the `values` list. The cumulative sum of these sums is stored in the `sum_values` list.

The program then iterates over the list of numbers provided as input and prints the sum of the numbers on the board for each number. This is done by accessing the `sum_values` list at the index corresponding to the current number.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. However, there is a potential issue with the program's performance. The program calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to n, which can be time-consuming for large values of n. This could potentially cause the program to exceed the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

To improve the program's performance, we could consider using a more efficient algorithm for calculating the sum of the digits, such as using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Alternatively, we could use a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table, to store the sum of the digits for each number.

Correctness: **True**
