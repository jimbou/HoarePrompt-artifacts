The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 10, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is 9, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 10 and n is greater than 9.
