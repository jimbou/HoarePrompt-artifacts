To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n` and `numbers`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 elements, and `n` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `total` is 45, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 45, `n` is the third element in the list, `word` is "45", `last` is 5, `remainder` is 4, `sum_total` is 15730481956924**
