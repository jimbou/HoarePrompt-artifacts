Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of each integer in the list and prints the sum of the digits of each integer. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer, which is an efficient approach. The program also handles the case where the input integer is greater than 44, which is the maximum value that can be represented by a single digit. The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of such integers by breaking them down into their last digit and the remaining digits, and then calculating the sum of the digits of the last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining digits. The program also correctly prints the sum of the digits of each integer in the list.

Correctness: **True**
