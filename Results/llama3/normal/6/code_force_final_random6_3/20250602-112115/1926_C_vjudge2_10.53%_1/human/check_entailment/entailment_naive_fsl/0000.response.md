Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the value of `values[i]`. The program assumes that the sum of the digits of a number is equal to the sum of the digits of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining part of the number. However, this assumption is not correct.

For example, consider the number 123. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. However, the program calculates the sum of the digits as `values[3] + values[12]`, which is 3 + (1 + 2) = 6. This is correct, but it is not correct for all numbers.

Consider the number 100. The sum of its digits is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. However, the program calculates the sum of the digits as `values[0] + values[10]`, which is 0 + (1 + 0) = 1. This is correct, but it is not correct for all numbers.

The issue is that the program assumes that the sum of the digits of a number is equal to the sum of the digits of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining part of the number. However, this assumption is not correct for all numbers.

A correct solution would be to calculate the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to n, and then sum up these values. This can be done using a simple loop.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    for n in numbers:
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        print(total)
```

This solution calculates the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to n, and then sums up these values. This solution is correct for all potential cases.
