The code prints the element at index `n` of the list `sum_values`. Where `n` is the third element in the list `numbers`. Since the exact `numbers` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the element at index `n` of the list `sum_values`.
Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is the third element in the list numbers)**
