The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11, `n` is greater than 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 12, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 11.
