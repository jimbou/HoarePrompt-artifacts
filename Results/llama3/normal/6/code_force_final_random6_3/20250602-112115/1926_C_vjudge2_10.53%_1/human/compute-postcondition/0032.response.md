Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers that must have at least `t` elements, `total` is 45, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 45, `n` is the last element in the list, `word` is "45", `last` is 5, `remainder` is 4, `sum_total` is 15730481956924, and the value of `sum_values` at index `n` which is the last element in the list is being printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variable `n` has taken on the value of the last element in the list `numbers`. The loop has printed the value of `sum_values` at the index of the last element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
