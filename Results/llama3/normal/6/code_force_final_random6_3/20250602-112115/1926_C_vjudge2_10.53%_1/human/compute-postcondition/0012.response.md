Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1, total is 1, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 1**

The code modifies the values of `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `values[i]`, making the second element of `values` equal to 1. The second line increments `total` by the value of `i`, making `total` equal to 1. The third line assigns the value of `total` to `sum_values[i]`, making the second element of `sum_values` equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
