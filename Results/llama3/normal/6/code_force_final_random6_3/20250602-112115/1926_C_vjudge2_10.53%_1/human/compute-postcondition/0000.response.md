The code assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. So now stdin only contains a list of integers. The second line initializes an empty list `numbers`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and `numbers` is an empty list. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
