Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing three integers, _ is 2, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. However, since stdin is empty in the initial state, this line will not have any effect on the variables. The second line appends the value of `n` to the list `numbers`. Since `n` is not assigned a value due to the empty stdin, this line will also not have any effect on the variables. Therefore, the final state remains the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values.
