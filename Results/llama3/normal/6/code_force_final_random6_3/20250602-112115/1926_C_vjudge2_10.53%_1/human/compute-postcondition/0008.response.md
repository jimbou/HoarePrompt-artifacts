The code initializes three variables: `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. The `values` and `sum_values` variables are lists, each containing `max(numbers) + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The `total` variable is also initialized to 0.

The `values` list is used to store the frequency of each number in the `numbers` list. The `sum_values` list is used to store the cumulative sum of the frequencies. The `total` variable is used to store the total count of numbers in the `numbers` list.

After the code executes, the `values` list will contain the frequency of each number in the `numbers` list, the `sum_values` list will contain the cumulative sum of the frequencies, and the `total` variable will contain the total count of numbers in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements, all initialized to 0, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements, all initialized to 0, total is 0, _ is t-1, stdin is empty**
