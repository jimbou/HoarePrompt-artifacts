Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 2, the fourth element is 3, the fifth element is 4, the sixth element is 5, the seventh element is 6, the eighth element is 7, the ninth element is 8, and the tenth element is 9, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 3, the fourth element is 6, the fifth element is 10, the sixth element is 15, the seventh element is 21, the eighth element is 28, the ninth element is 36, and the tenth element is 45, total is 45, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 9
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 2, the fourth element is 3, the fifth element is 4, the sixth element is 5, the seventh element is 6, the eighth element is 7, the ninth element is 8, the tenth element is 9, the eleventh element is 45, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 3, the fourth element is 6, the fifth element is 10, the sixth element is 15, the seventh element is 21, the eighth element is 28, the ninth element is 36, the tenth element is 45, the eleventh element is 90, total is 45, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 10, n is greater than 9

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 2, the fourth element is 3, the fifth element is 4, the sixth element is 5, the seventh element is 6, the eighth element is 7, the ninth element is 8, the tenth element is 9, the eleventh element is 45, the twelfth element is 54, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 3, the fourth element is 6, the fifth element is 10, the sixth element is 15, the seventh element is 21, the eighth element is 28, the ninth element is 36, the tenth element is 45, the eleventh element is 90, the twelfth element is 135, total is 45, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 11, n is greater than 10

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 2, the fourth element is 3, the fifth element is 4, the sixth element is 5, the seventh element is 6, the eighth element is 7, the ninth element is 8, the tenth element is 9, the eleventh element is 45, the twelfth element is 54, the thirteenth element is 99, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 3, the fourth element is 6, the fifth element is 10, the sixth element is 15, the seventh element is 21, the eighth element is 28, the ninth element is 36, the tenth element is 45, the eleventh element is 90, the twelfth element is 135, the thirteenth element is 234, total is 45, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 12, n is greater than 11, word is "12", last is 2, remainder is 1, sum_total is 99




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
