Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing t integers, values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 2, the fourth element is 3, the fifth element is 4, the sixth element is 5, the seventh element is 6, the eighth element is 7, the ninth element is 8, and the tenth element is 9, sum_values is a list containing max(numbers) + 1 elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 1, the third element is 3, the fourth element is 6, the fifth element is 10, the sixth element is 15, the seventh element is 21, the eighth element is 28, the ninth element is 36, and the tenth element is 45, total is 45, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, i is 9**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'values' contains the numbers from 0 to 9, the list 'sum_values' contains the cumulative sum of the numbers from 0 to 9, the variable 'total' contains the sum of the numbers from 0 to 9, and the variable 'i' contains the last index of the loop, which is 9. The other variables 't', 'numbers', and '_' remain unchanged.
