The code snippet executes the following operations:

1.  It converts the value of `i` (which is 11) to a string `word`.
2.  It extracts the last digit of `word` (which is 1) and converts it to an integer `last`.
3.  It extracts all digits of `word` except the last one (which is 1) and converts it to an integer `remainder`.
4.  It updates the value of `values[i]` (which is `values[11]`) by adding the values of `values[last]` (which is `values[1]`) and `values[remainder]` (which is `values[1]`). Since `values[1]` is 1, `values[11]` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
5.  It calculates `sum_total` by adding the value of `values[i]` (which is 2) and `sum_values[i - 1]` (which is `sum_values[10]`). Since `sum_values[10]` is 45, `sum_total` becomes 2 + 45 = 47.
6.  It updates the value of `sum_values[i]` (which is `sum_values[11]`) with the calculated `sum_total` (which is 47).
