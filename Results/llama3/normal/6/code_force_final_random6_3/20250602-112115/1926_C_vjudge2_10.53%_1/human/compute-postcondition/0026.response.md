To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `n` and `numbers`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least one element, and `n` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least two elements, and `n` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total` is 45, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 45, `n` is the second element in the list, `word` is "45", `last` is 5, `remainder` is 4, `sum_total` is 15730481956924, and the value of `sum_values` at index `n` is being printed**
