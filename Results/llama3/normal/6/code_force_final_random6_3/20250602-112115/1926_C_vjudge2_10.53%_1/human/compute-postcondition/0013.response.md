To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(10):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list containing `max(numbers) + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1, `sum_values` is a list containing `max(numbers) + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1, `total` is 1, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**
