The code prints the value of `sum_values` at index `n`, where `n` is the second element in the list `numbers`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `sum_values` at index `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `sum_values` at the index specified by the second element of the `numbers` list.

Output: **sum_values at index n (where n is the second element in the list numbers)**
