Output State: **cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is at least 1, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `score` has been incremented by the value of `a` at index `current_pos - 1`, and `current_pos` has been updated to the value of `p` at index `current_pos - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
