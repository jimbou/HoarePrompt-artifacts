Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings representing space-separated integers, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    PB = int(data[index + 2])
    PS = int(data[index + 3])
    index += 4
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, index is increased by 2n + 4, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a), n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, index is increased by 2n + 12, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result from the current test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, index is increased by 2n + 20, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result from the current test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
