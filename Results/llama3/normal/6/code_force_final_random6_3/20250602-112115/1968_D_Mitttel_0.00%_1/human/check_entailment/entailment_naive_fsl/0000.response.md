Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the "Permutation game" problem. It correctly implements the game logic, where two players move simultaneously, and their scores increase by the value at their current position. The program determines the winner by comparing the scores after a specified number of turns.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. `func_1` is the main function that takes the input parameters and calls `calculate_score` to compute the scores for both players. `calculate_score` calculates the score for a given starting position by simulating the game and handling cycles in the permutation. `func_2` reads the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program correctly handles the game logic, including the case where a player stays at the same position or moves to a new position. It also correctly handles cycles in the permutation by detecting the cycle start and calculating the score for the remaining steps.

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It correctly follows the problem description and handles all possible scenarios.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
