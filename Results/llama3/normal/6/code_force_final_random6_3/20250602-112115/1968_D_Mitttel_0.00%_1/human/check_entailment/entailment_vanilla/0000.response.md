Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha. The game involves two players starting at different positions in a permutation and moving through the permutation while accumulating scores based on the values in an array. The player with the higher score after a specified number of turns wins the game.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes the length of the permutation, the number of turns, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and the array as input. It calculates the scores of Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function and returns the winner of the game.

`calculate_score` calculates the score of a player starting at a given position. It simulates the player's movement through the permutation, accumulating scores and detecting cycles in the permutation. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining turns by considering the full cycles and the remaining steps.

`func_2` reads the input data from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic of the "Permutation game" and handles cycles in the permutation. It also efficiently calculates the scores for the remaining turns after a cycle is detected.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the `calculate_score` function, the line `if steps >= k: return score` is incorrect. This line causes the function to return the score prematurely if the number of steps reaches `k` before a cycle is detected. This can lead to incorrect results if the permutation has a cycle that starts after the `k`-th step.

Correctness: **False**
