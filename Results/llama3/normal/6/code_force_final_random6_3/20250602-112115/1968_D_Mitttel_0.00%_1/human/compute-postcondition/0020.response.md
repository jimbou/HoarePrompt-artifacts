To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(cycle_length):`. The only object in the loop head is `cycle_length`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cycle_length`. If `cycle_length` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cycle_length` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `cycle_length` must be greater than 1.

State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than `cycle_start`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of positive integers, `score` is the original score plus the sum of the values of `a` at indices `current_pos` - 1, `current_pos` is the original `current_pos`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` has additional entries with keys `current_pos` and values `steps`, `cycle_start` is the value of `visited[current_pos]`, `cycle_length` is at least 2, `cycle_score` is the original `cycle_score` plus the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos` - 1, and `cycle_pos` is `p[cycle_pos - 1]`.**
