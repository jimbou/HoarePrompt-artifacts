Output State: **cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus twice the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is p[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1], start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the original current_pos, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is at least 2.**

The code modifies the `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` variables. The first line increments `cycle_score` by the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos - 1`. The second line updates `cycle_pos` to be the value of `p` at index `cycle_pos - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
