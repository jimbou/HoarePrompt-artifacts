Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be equal to 0, index is increased by 2n + 4t, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `index` is increased by 2n + 4t, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of positive integers representing the array, and the first result in the list of results is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `index` is increased by 2n + 4t, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of positive integers representing the array, and the second result in the list of results which is [result] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `index` is increased by 2n + 4t, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of positive integers representing the array, and the third result in the list of results which is `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
