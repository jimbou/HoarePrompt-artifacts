Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be equal to 0, index is increased by 2n + 4t, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases (t) is reduced to 0, the index is increased by a total of 2n + 4t (where n is the length of the permutation and t is the number of test cases), the results list contains the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each test case, and the other variables (n, k, PB, PS, p, and a) retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
