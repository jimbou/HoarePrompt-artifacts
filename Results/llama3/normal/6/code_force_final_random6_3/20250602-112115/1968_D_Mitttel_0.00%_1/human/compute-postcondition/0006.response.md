Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, index is increased by 2n + 20, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result from the current test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array**.

The code snippet reads data from the `data` list using the `index` variable, which is incremented by 4 to read the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS`. Then, it reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the `data` list using the `index` variable, which is incremented by `n` to read the entire permutation and array. The `index` variable is incremented by a total of `2n + 20` after reading all the data. The `results` list is appended with the result of the `func_1` function, which takes the read values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` as arguments. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are updated with the newly read values.
