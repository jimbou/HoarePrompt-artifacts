To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(remainder_steps):`.

The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `remainder_steps`. Since `_` is not used anywhere, we can ignore it. The state of `remainder_steps` needs to be adjusted.

According to the code, `remainder_steps` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 1.

State: **`cycle_score` is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, `cycle_pos` is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, `start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of positive integers, `score` is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1], `current_pos` is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, `steps` is equal to k, `visited` has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, `cycle_start` is the value of visited[current_pos], `cycle_length` is equal to k - cycle_start, `full_cycles` is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, `remainder_steps` is at least 2, `_` is 0**
