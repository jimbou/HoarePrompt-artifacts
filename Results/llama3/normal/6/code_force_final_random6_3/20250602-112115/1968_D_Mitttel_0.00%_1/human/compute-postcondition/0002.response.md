Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, index is increased by 2n + 4, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a), n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, and `results`. The values of `t` remain unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `index` variable is incremented by `2n + 4` due to the two increments by `n` and the initial increment by `4`. The `results` list now contains the result of the function `func_1` called with the modified values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are updated based on the values extracted from the `data` list.
