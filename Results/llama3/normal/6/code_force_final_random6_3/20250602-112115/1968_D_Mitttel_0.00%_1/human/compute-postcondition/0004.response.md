Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, index is increased by 2n + 12, results contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result from the current test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `index` is increased by `2n + 12` due to the multiple increments in the code. The `results` list now contains the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the previous test case and the new result from the current test case. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are updated based on the input data and are now positive integers representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and the array, respectively.
