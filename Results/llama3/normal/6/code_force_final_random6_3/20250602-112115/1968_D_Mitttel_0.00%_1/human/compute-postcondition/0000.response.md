Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings representing space-separated integers, n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, p is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of positive integers representing the array.**

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the `data` variable. The `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list, and it is initialized to 0. The first element of the `data` list is converted to an integer and assigned to the `t` variable, which represents the number of test cases. The `index` is then incremented by 1. An empty list called `results` is also created. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
