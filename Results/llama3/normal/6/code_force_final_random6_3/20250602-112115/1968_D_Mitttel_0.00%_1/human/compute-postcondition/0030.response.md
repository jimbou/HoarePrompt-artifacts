According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `remainder_steps`. If `_` is less than `remainder_steps`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `remainder_steps` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `remainder_steps` must be greater than 1.
State: **cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index p[current_pos - 1] - 1, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is at least 1, _ is 1**
