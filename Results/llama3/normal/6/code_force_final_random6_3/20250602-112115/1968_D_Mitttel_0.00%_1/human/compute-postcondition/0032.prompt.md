Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score, current_pos is the original current_pos, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, remaining_steps is 0, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is at least 1, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index p[current_pos - 1] - 1, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is at least 2, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index p[p[current_pos - 1] - 1] - 1, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is at least 1, _ is 1, steps is equal to k




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
