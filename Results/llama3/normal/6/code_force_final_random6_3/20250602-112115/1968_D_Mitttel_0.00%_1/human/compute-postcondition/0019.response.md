Output State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the original current_pos, steps is equal to k, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is at least 1, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, and cycle_pos is p[cycle_pos - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `start_pos`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, and `cycle_length` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `cycle_score` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos - 1`, and the value of `cycle_pos` is updated to be the value of `p` at index `cycle_pos - 1`.
