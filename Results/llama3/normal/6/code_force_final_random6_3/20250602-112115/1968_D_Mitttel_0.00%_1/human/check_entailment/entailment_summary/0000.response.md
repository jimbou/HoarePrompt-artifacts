Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on their scores calculated by the function `calculate_score`. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`.

`func_1` determines the winner of the game by comparing the scores of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' calculated by the `calculate_score` function. It returns a string indicating the winner, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' if their scores are equal.

`calculate_score` calculates a score based on a sequence of positions and values, handling both linear and cyclic sequences. It uses a while loop to iterate through the sequence, keeping track of the current position, score, and steps taken. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle score and adds it to the total score.

`func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The input is expected to be a list of space-separated integers, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, followed by the test case data. Each test case consists of the length of a permutation, the duration of a game, the starting positions of two players, and the permutation and array data. The function processes each test case, calling the `func_1` function with the test case data, and stores the results in a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game logic and correctly determines the winner based on the scores calculated by the `calculate_score` function. The `func_2` function correctly reads and processes the input data, and the `func_1` function correctly determines the winner based on the scores.

Correctness: **True**
