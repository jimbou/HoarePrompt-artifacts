To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `result` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop will execute.

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `results` must have at least 1 result, and the `result` variable should be the first result in the list.

State: **`t` is 0, `index` is increased by 2n + 4t, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of positive integers representing the array.**
