Output State: **score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index p[p[current_pos - 1] - 1] - 1, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is at least 1, _ is 1, steps is equal to k**

The code block increments the score by the value of `a` at the current position, and then updates the current position to the value of `p` at the index of the current position minus one. The score is updated by adding the value of `a` at the current position to the original score, plus the sum of the values of `a` at indices `current_pos - 1` plus `full_cycles` times `cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`. The current position is updated to the value of `p` at the index of the current position minus one, which is `p[p[current_pos - 1] - 1] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
