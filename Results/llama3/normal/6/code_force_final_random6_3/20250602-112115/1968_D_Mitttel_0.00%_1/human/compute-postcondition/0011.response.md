To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `results` and `result`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, and `result` is the first result in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least 2 results, and `result` must be the second result in the list.

State: **`t` is 0, `index` is increased by 2n + 4t, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of positive integers representing the array**
