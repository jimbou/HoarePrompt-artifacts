Postcondition: ***start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers. If cycle_start is not equal to -1, then score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 for remainder_steps iterations, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1 after remainder_steps iterations, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
