Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The input is expected to be a list of space-separated integers, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, followed by the test case data. Each test case consists of the length of a permutation, the duration of a game, the starting positions of two players, and the permutation and array data. The function processes each test case, calling the `func_1` function with the test case data, and stores the results in a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, the results have been printed, and the program has terminated.**
