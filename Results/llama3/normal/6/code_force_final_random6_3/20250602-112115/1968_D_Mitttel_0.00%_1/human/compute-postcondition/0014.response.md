According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 results the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 results, result is the second result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 results and the result is the third result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `index` is increased by 2n + 4t, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of positive integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of positive integers representing the array**
