To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `remainder_steps`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`cycle_score` is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, `cycle_pos` is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, `start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of positive integers, `score` is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score, `current_pos` is the original current_pos, `steps` is equal to k, `visited` has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, `cycle_start` is the value of visited[current_pos], `cycle_length` is equal to k - cycle_start, `full_cycles` is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, `remainder_steps` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
