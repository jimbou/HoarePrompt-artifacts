Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the problem description. The program uses a depth-first search approach to calculate the scores of Bodya and Sasha. It handles the case where the game duration is less than the length of the permutation, and it also handles the case where the game duration is greater than or equal to the length of the permutation. The program correctly calculates the scores of Bodya and Sasha in both cases and returns the correct result.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the input from the standard input, processes the input, and prints the results to the standard output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
