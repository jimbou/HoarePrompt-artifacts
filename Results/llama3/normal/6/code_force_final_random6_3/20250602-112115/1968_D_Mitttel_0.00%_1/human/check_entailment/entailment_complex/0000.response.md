Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of the players, and the permutation and array data.

2. The program correctly processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function with the test case data and storing the results in a list.

3. The `func_1` function correctly determines the winner of the game by calculating the scores of both players using the `calculate_score` function and comparing the scores.

4. The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score of a player by simulating the game and summing up the values of the array at the positions visited by the player.

5. The program correctly handles both linear and cyclic sequences by detecting cycles in the permutation and calculating the score accordingly.

6. The program correctly prints the results of each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
