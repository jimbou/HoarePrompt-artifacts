Output State: **score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 for remainder_steps iterations, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1 after remainder_steps iterations, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1 for cycle_length iterations, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1 after cycle_length iterations, start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than cycle_start, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of positive integers, visited has additional entries with keys current_pos and values steps, cycle_start is the value of visited[current_pos], cycle_length is equal to k - cycle_start, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is 0, _ is remainder_steps**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the score is updated by adding the sum of the values of 'a' at indices 'current_pos - 1' for 'remainder_steps' iterations, and 'current_pos' is updated by moving 'remainder_steps' iterations forward in the list 'p'. The other variables remain unchanged.
