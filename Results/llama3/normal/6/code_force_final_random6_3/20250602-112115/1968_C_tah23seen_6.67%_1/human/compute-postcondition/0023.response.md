Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500 and n is greater than i by at least 2, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n`, and `ans[n]` is `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `n` is still between 4 and 500 and is greater than `i` by at least 2, the list `ans` has an additional element at index `n` which is the sum of the element at index `n-1` in `arr` and the element at index `n-1` in `ans`, and the value of `i` is still `n`.
