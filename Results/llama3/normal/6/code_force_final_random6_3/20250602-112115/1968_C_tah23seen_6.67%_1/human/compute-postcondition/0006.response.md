The variables in the loop head are `ans` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `arr`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is 0, `arr[i + 1]` is a non-negative integer. `arr[i + 1]` being a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 0, `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 0**
