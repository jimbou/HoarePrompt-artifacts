Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers where arr[2] must be greater than or equal to arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, the fourth element is `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, and the rest of the elements are 0, and `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged with n-1 non-negative integers where the third element is at least the second element plus twice the first element plus one. The value of `n` is still between 4 and 500. The list `ans` has been updated such that the first three elements are still based on the first two elements of `arr`, but the fourth element is now the sum of the third element of `ans` and the third element of `arr`. The rest of the elements in `ans` are still 0. The value of `i` is still 2.
