Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the integer `n` is still between 3 and 500, the list `ans` has its third element updated to be twice the second element, and the index `i` is still 0.
