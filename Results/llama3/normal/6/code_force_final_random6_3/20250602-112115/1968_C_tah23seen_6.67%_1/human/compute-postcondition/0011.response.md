Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then the third element of `ans` is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1) + (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, otherwise, the third element of `ans` is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`. The rest of the elements in `ans` are 0, and `i` is 0.***
