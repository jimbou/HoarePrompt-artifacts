Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are 0, and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, where `i` is 1. This means that the third element of `ans` is now `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The value of `i` has been incremented to 2.
