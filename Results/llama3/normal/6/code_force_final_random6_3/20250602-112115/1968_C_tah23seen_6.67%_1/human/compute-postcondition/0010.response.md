Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, the fourth element is `2 * (2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1))`, and the rest are 0 except the third element which is now `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1) + (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, `i` is 0, `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 0, `arr[0]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1] / 2 - 1/2`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` has been modified such that the first three elements are `arr[0] + 1`, `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, respectively, and the fourth element is `2 * (2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1))`. The rest of the elements in `ans` are 0, except for the third element which is now `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1) + (2 * arr[0] + 1)`. The value of `i` remains 0, and the conditions `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 0 and `arr[0]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1] / 2 - 1/2` are still true.
