Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers where `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, the fourth element is `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, the fifth element is `2 * (arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1)`, and the rest of the elements are 0, and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged with its properties intact. The value of `n` also remains the same. The list `ans` has its fifth element updated to be twice the value of its third element. The value of `i` remains 2.
