Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500 and n is greater than i by at least 2, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n`, and `ans[n]` is `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`, and `ans[i + 1]` is increased by `ans[i]`, and `ans[i + 1]` must be less than `arr[i + 1]`, and `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i] + ans[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `n` is still between 4 and 500 and is at least 2 more than `i`, the list `ans` has the same elements as before, but the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been increased by the value of `ans[i]`. The value of `i` is still `n`, and the last element of `ans` is still the sum of the last element of `arr` and the second last element of `ans`. The condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than `arr[i + 1]` still holds, and the new value of `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `ans[i]`.
