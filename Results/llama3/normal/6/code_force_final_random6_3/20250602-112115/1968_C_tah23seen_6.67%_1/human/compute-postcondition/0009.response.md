Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, the fourth element is `2 * (2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1))`, and the rest are 0 except the third element which is now `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1) + (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, `i` is 0, `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 0, `arr[0]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1] / 2 - 1/2**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `n` is still between 3 and 500, the list `ans` has its third element updated to be the sum of its previous value and the second element, the value of `i` is still 0, and the relationship between `arr[0]` and `arr[i + 1]` is still maintained.
