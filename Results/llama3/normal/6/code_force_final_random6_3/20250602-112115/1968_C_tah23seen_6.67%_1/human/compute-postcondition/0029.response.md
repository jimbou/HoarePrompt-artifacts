Output State: **`arr` is a list of n non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500 and n is greater than i by at least 2, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n`, and `ans[n]` is `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`, and `ans[i + 1]` is increased by `ans[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than `ans[i] + ans[i + 1]`, and `ans[i+1]` is increased by `ans[i]` which is `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, and the integer `n` is still within the range of 4 to 500 and is greater than `i` by at least 2. The list `ans` has been updated such that the value of `ans[i + 1]` is increased by the value of `ans[i]`, which is equal to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`. The rest of the elements in `ans` remain the same.
