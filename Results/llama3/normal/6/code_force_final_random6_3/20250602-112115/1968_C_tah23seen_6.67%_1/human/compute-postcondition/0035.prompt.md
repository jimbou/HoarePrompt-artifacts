You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n-2`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is arr[0] + 1, the second element is 2 * arr[0] + 1, the third element is arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1], except the last element which is now ans[-2] + arr[-1], where arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is arr[0] + 1, the second element is 2 * arr[0] + 1, the third element is arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1], except the last element which is now ans[-2] + arr[-1], where arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
