The value of `ans[i + 1]` is assigned the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `ans[1]` is assigned the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`. The value of `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, so `ans[1]` is assigned the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[0] + 1`, which is `2 * arr[0] + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 0**
