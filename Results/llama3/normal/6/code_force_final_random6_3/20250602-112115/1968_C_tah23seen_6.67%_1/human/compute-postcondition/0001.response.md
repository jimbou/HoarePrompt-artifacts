To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 2` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is arr[0] + 1 and the rest are 0, `i` is 0**
