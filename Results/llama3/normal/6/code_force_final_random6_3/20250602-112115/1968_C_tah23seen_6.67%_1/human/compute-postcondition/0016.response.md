According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `arr`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, the fourth element is `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, and the rest of the elements are 0, and `arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers where `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`. Since `ans[3]` is `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers where `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, the fourth element is `arr[1] + 3 * arr[0] + 2`, and the rest of the elements are 0, and `i` is 2**
