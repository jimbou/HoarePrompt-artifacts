Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n integers where the first element is arr[0] + 1 and the rest are 0.**

The code initializes a list `ans` of length `n` with all elements as 0. Then, it assigns the value of `arr[0] + 1` to the first element of `ans`. The rest of the elements in `ans` remain 0. The values of `arr` and `n` are not modified by the code.
