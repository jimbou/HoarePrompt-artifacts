Output State: **ans[i + 1] is equal to arr[i + 1].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that the loop continues to execute until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than `arr[i + 1]`, at which point `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
