Output State: **The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are the result of the loop execution, and `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of n integers where the first three elements are calculated based on the initial values of `arr`, and the rest of the elements are the result of the loop execution, which doubles the previous element and adds it to the current element, until the loop condition is no longer met. The value of `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
