Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, except the last element which is now `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, and `i` is `n-2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `n` is still between 2 and 500, the list `ans` has its last element updated to be the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`, and the value of `i` is still `n-2`.
