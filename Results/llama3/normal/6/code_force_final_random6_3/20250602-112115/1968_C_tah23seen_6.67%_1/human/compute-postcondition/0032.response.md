Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n-2`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of n integers where the first three elements are `arr[0] + 1`, `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, respectively. The rest of the elements in the list are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`. The loop iterates `n-2` times, and the value of `i` is `n-2` after the loop finishes executing.
