Output State: **The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is arr[0] + 1, the second element is 2 * arr[0] + 1, the third element is arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1], except the last element which is now ans[-2] + arr[-1], where arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.**
