Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `arr[i + 1]`***
