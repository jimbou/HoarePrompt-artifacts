Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500 and n is greater than i by at least 2, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or the result of the loop execution based on the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n`, and `ans[n]` is `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.***
