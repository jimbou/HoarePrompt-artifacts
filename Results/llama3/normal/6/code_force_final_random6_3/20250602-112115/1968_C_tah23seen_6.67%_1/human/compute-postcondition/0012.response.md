The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then the third element of `ans` is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1) + (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, otherwise, the third element of `ans` is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`. The rest of the elements in `ans` are 0, and `i` is 1**
