Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of n integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the third element is `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`, the fourth element is `2 * (2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1))`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 0, `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 0**

The value of `ans[i + 1]` is increased by `ans[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `ans[i + 1]` is the second element of `ans`, which is `2 * arr[0] + 1`. The value of `ans[i]` is `arr[0] + 1`. Therefore, the second element of `ans` is increased by `arr[0] + 1`, resulting in `2 * arr[0] + 1 + arr[0] + 1 = 2 * (2 * arr[0] + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
