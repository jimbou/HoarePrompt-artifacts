Functionality: This function generates a list of n integers based on the input list of n-1 non-negative integers and the integer n. It initializes the first element as arr[0] + 1, the second element as 2 * arr[0] + 1, and the third element as arr[1] + 2 * arr[0] + 1. For the remaining elements, it either sets them to 0 or calculates their values based on the condition ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1], and finally sets the last element as ans[-2] + arr[-1]. The function returns this list of n integers.
