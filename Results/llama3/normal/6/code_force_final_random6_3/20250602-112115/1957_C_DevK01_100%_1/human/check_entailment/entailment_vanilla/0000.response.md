Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the task is to continue playing until there are no valid moves remaining.

The program first reads the number of test cases, t. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard, n, and the number of moves already played, k. It then reads the k moves, each represented by two integers, r and c, denoting the row and column of the move.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where r is not equal to c (since the computer can mirror the move), and subtracting 1 from n for each move where r is equal to c (since the computer cannot mirror the move).

The program then calls the function func_1 with the remaining number of valid moves, n, as an argument. The function func_1 calculates the number of different final configurations possible using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two values, 1 and 1, representing the number of configurations for 0 and 1 valid moves, respectively. It then iterates from 2 to n, calculating the number of configurations for each number of valid moves by adding the number of configurations for the previous number of valid moves plus twice the number of configurations for the number of valid moves two steps back, multiplied by the current number of valid moves minus 1. The result is taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.

Finally, the program prints the result of the function func_1 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
