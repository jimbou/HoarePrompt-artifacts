The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 2. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `dp` is a list containing two elements, both equal to 1, `i` is 2**
