Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations, and it correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move.

The program first calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where a != b, and subtracting 1 from n for each move where a == b. This is because when a != b, the computer can mirror the player's move, resulting in two fewer valid moves, and when a == b, the computer cannot mirror the player's move, resulting in one fewer valid move.

The program then calls the function func_1 with the remaining number of valid moves n. The function func_1 calculates the number of configurations using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two elements as 1, and then calculates the next elements of the list using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (7 + 10^9). This recurrence relation is based on the fact that the number of configurations for i valid moves is equal to the number of configurations for i-1 valid moves plus 2 * (i - 1) times the number of configurations for i-2 valid moves.

Finally, the program returns the last element of the list dp, which is the result of the expression (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9), where 'n' is a positive integer, and 'dp' is a list containing two elements.

Correctness: **True**
