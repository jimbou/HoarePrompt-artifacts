Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It first calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting the number of moves already made (k) from the total number of moves possible (n). If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., a == b), it subtracts 2 from the total number of moves, otherwise, it subtracts 1.

The function func_1(n) calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two values as 1, representing the base cases where there are 0 or 1 valid moves remaining. Then, for each remaining valid move (from 2 to n), it calculates the number of possible configurations by adding the number of configurations for the previous move (dp[-1]) and twice the number of configurations for the move before that (2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]), modulo 10^9 + 7. This is because for each valid move, there are two possible configurations: either the computer mirrors the move or it doesn't.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n is 0 or 1, and k is 0 or n. It also correctly handles the case where a move is not mirrored by the computer.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
