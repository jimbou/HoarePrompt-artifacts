Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, which represents the number of possible configurations. The Fibonacci sequence is used because each move can be either a mirrored move (which doesn't change the number of possible configurations) or a non-mirrored move (which doubles the number of possible configurations). The program correctly handles the case where a move is mirrored by the computer and the case where a move is not mirrored.

Correctness: **True**
