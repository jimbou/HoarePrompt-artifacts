Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 3, i is the previous value of i plus 1, dp is a list containing two elements, the first element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9), the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)**

The code snippet appends a new element to the `dp` list, which is calculated using the last two elements of the list and the value of `i`. This new element is then added to the end of the list. The first element of the list is then removed using the `pop(0)` method. As a result, the list `dp` now contains two new elements, both of which are calculated using the previous values of `dp` and `i`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is still the previous value plus 1.
