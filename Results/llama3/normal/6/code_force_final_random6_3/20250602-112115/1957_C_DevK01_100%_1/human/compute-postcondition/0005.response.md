To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, and `i` is the value that was used in the previous iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will execute for the next value of `i` in the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `dp` is a list containing two elements, the first element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9), the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)**

Note that the state of `dp` remains the same, since it is not modified by the loop head. Only the state of `i` is updated to reflect the next value in the range.
