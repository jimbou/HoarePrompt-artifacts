The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `dp` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 1, the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10**9)**
