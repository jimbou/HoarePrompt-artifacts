This function determines whether a given list of integers represents a valid permutation or not. It accepts a list of integers as input, where each integer is a position in the list, and checks if any integer points to its own position. If such a case is found, it prints 2, indicating an invalid permutation. Otherwise, it prints 3, indicating a valid permutation. The function does not modify the input list or any other external state, and its sole purpose is to provide a validation result based on the input permutation.
