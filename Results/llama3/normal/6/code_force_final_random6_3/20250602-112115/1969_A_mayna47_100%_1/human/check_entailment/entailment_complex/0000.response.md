Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program iterates through each test case, reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends `p_i`, and checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of a flag variable `v` to keep track of the best friends is efficient, and the loop that checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends is well-structured.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems that the function is supposed to contain the logic for solving the problem, but it is not provided. Therefore, the program will not run correctly as it is.

Correctness: **False**
