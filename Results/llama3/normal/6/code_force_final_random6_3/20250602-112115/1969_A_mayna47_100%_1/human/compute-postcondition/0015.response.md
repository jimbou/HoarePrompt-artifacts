Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n+1`, `v` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 0, stdin contains `t+2t-2` lines. If `v[v[i]]` equals `i` for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` for all `i` in the range 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one more than the initial value of `n`, and the list `v` will remain unchanged. If at any point during the loop's execution the condition `v[v[i]] == i` was true, the number 2 would have been printed and the loop would have terminated early. If this condition was never true for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, then the loop will have completed all its iterations without printing 2.
