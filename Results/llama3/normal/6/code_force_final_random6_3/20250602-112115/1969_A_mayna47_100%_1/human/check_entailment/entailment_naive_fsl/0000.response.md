Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program first checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2, because sending invitations to these two friends will result in both of them coming to the party.

If it doesn't find any such pairs, it prints 3, because in the worst-case scenario, Monocarp needs to send invitations to three friends to guarantee that at least two of them will come to the party.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, and the case where there are multiple such pairs. It also correctly handles the case where the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
