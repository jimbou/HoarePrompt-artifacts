Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The program takes the number of test cases as input, and for each test case, it takes the number of friends and their best friends as input.

The program uses a list `v` to store the best friends of each friend, where `v[i]` represents the best friend of friend `i`. It then iterates through the list to find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to only 2 friends for them to come to the party.

If no such pair is found after iterating through the entire list, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends for at least 2 friends to come to the party.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. It correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **True**
