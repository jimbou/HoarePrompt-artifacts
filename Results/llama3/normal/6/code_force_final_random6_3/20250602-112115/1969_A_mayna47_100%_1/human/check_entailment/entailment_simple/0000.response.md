Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program iterates through each test case, reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends `p_i`, and checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. If there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, sending invitations to these two friends is sufficient. If no such pair exists, sending invitations to at least three friends is necessary to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **True**
