The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains t+2t-1 lines. The second line creates a list `v` of size `n+1` with all elements initialized to 0. The third line assigns a new list to `v` by reading `n` space-separated integers from the input. Since `n` is the number of integers, the list `v` now contains `n` integers, and the first element of `v` is 0 (because of the `[0] +` part). The stdin now contains t+2t-2 lines.

Output State: **n is an integer, v is a list of n integers with the first element being 0, stdin contains t+2t-2 lines**
