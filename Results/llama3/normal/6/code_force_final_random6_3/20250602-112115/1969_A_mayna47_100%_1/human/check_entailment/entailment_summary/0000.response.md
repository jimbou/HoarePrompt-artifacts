Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. The program works by checking if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the condition that a friend will only attend the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation. By checking for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program is effectively identifying the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.

Correctness: **True**
