Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n+1`, `v` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 0, stdin contains `t+2t-2` lines. If `v[v[i]]` equals `i` for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` for all `i` in the range 1 to `n`, and the number 3 is being printed**
