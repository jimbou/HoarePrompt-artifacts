The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `v` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 0, stdin contains `t+2t-2` lines. If `v[v[i]]` equals `i`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.**
