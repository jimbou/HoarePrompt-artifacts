    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is equal to k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost which is the sum of the products of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, where the number of tickets bought is k, and the popped prices are from the min-heap pq containing tuples of prices and their original indices from the list prices of n positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of buying a specified number of tickets (k) from a list of prices, where the number of tickets bought on each day is limited by a daily limit (m), and the price increases by the number of tickets bought each day. The function takes in the list of prices, the daily limit, and the total number of tickets to buy, and returns the total cost incurred.
