Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).

3. It then reads the prices of tickets for each day and stores them in the list `prices`.

4. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the parameters n, m, k, and prices. This function is designed to calculate the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

5. Inside the `func_1` function, it creates a priority queue (pq) using the `heapq` module. The priority queue stores tuples containing the price of the ticket and the day it is available. The prices are used as the priority, so the ticket with the lowest price is always at the top of the queue.

6. The function then initializes variables to keep track of the total cost, the number of tickets bought, and the price increase due to buying tickets.

7. The function enters a while loop that continues until all k tickets are bought. In each iteration, it pops the ticket with the lowest price from the priority queue, adds the price increase to the price, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day (which is the minimum of m and the remaining tickets to buy).

8. It then updates the total cost, the number of tickets bought, and the price increase.

9. Once all tickets are bought, the function returns the total cost.

10. The main program prints the result of the `func_1` function for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
