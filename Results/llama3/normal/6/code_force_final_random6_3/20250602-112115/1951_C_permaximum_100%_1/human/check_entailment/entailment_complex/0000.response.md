Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly implements a priority queue (min-heap) to store the prices of tickets along with their original indices. This allows it to efficiently select the day with the lowest price for buying tickets.
2.  The program correctly calculates the number of tickets to buy on each day, which is the minimum of the daily limit (m) and the remaining number of tickets to buy (k - tickets_bought).
3.  The program correctly updates the total cost by adding the product of the current price and the number of tickets bought.
4.  The program correctly updates the price increase by adding the number of tickets bought, which reflects the increase in price due to buying tickets.
5.  The program correctly terminates when all tickets have been bought (tickets_bought == k).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum spending to purchase k tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
