Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought and tickets_bought must be less than k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, price is the popped price plus price_increase, day is the original index of the popped price, tickets_to_buy is the minimum of m and k - tickets_bought.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and prices remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The min-heap pq has one less element after the heappop operation. The total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, which is the minimum of m and k - tickets_bought. The tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought, which is also the minimum of m and k - tickets_bought. The price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought. The price is the popped price plus price_increase, and day is the original index of the popped price. The tickets_to_buy is the minimum of m and k - tickets_bought.
