Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list of prices also remains the same. A new min-heap, pq, is created containing tuples of prices and their original indices, which allows for efficient extraction of the minimum price. The variables total_cost, tickets_bought, and price_increase are initialized to 0, indicating that no tickets have been bought, no cost has been incurred, and there has been no price increase.
