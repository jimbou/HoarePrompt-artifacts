According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought` and `k`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, but we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is still less than `k` after the last iteration. So, `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `tickets_bought`.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than tickets_bought and less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, price is the popped price plus price_increase, day is the original index of the popped price, tickets_to_buy is the minimum of m and k - tickets_bought**
