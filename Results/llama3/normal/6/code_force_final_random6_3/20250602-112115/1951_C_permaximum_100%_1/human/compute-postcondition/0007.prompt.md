Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices with one less element, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought and tickets_bought must be less than k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, price is the popped price plus price_increase, day is the original index of the popped price, tickets_to_buy is the minimum of m and k - tickets_bought.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than tickets_bought and less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices with one less element, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, price is the popped price plus price_increase, day is the original index of the popped price, tickets_to_buy is 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
