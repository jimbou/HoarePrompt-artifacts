The only variable in the loop head is variable tickets_bought, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable tickets_bought.  If tickets_bought is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought, So for the loop to be executed one more time tickets_bought must be less than k.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices with one less element, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought and tickets_bought must be less than k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought.**
