To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `tickets_bought < k`. This condition depends on the values of `tickets_bought` and `k`.

Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n*m` and 10^9. Since `tickets_bought` is already 0, which is less than any positive integer, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is indeed greater than 0.

However, since `k` is already defined as a positive integer, it inherently satisfies the condition of being greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states of `tickets_bought` and `k` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0**
