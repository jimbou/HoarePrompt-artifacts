Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their original indices, total_cost is increased by the product of the popped price and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is equal to k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of tickets bought (tickets_bought) has reached the target number of tickets (k), and the total cost has been updated accordingly. The price increase has also been updated based on the number of tickets bought. The other variables, such as the number of days (n), the number of tickets per day (m), the list of prices, and the priority queue, remain unchanged.
