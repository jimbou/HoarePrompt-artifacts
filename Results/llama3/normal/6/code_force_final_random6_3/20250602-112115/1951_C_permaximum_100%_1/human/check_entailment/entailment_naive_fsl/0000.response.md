Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets. The problem statement requires that the price per ticket for each day is increased by the number of tickets purchased on the previous day. However, the program does not update the prices in the priority queue after purchasing tickets.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will purchase 2 tickets on the first day, increasing the price per ticket for the remaining days to [8, 6, 4]. However, it will then purchase 1 ticket on the second day, but it will not update the prices in the priority queue to reflect the increased price per ticket. As a result, it will purchase the remaining 1 ticket on the third day at the incorrect price of 4, instead of the correct price of 5 (which is the price per ticket after purchasing 1 ticket on the second day).

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets and does not produce the correct output for all potential cases.
