Based on the precondition, the value of `fnd` is determined by the total count of common elements between `aa` and `bb`, which is stored in the variable `tot`. If `tot` is at least `k`, then `fnd` is 1, otherwise it is 0.

Since the exact values of `tot` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `fnd`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 0 or 1, depending on whether the total count of common elements is at least `k`.

Output: **0 or 1 (where 1 indicates that the total count of common elements is at least k, and 0 indicates that it is less than k)**
