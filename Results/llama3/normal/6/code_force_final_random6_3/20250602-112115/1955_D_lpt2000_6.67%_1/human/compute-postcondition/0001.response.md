The only variable in the loop head is `nabors`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `nabors`. If `nabors` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `nabors` to be at least 1.

State: **`nabors` is at least 1**
