Precondition: **stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k, where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The number of test cases is between 1 and 10^4.**
