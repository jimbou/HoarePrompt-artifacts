Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k, where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 1, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:] if C[in_aa] is greater than 0, otherwise in_aa is the last element in aa[m+1:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], and the value of fnd is printed which is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer equal to n - 1, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 2, in_aa is the last element in aa, out_aa is the last element in aa, and the value of fnd is being printed which is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer less than n, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between all elements of aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, nabors is at least 3, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], D[out_aa] is decreased by 1 if D[out_aa] > 0, otherwise E[out_aa] is decreased by 1, C[in_aa] is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], otherwise D[in_aa] is increased by 1, E[in_aa] is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is not greater than 0, and this is printed: fnd which is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
