Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` integers, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa`. If `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]`, then the count of `in_aa` in `C` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the count of `in_aa` in `D` is increased by 1 and `tot` is increased by 1. `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between `aa` and `bb`, `fnd` is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` is empty, `nabors` is at least 1.**
