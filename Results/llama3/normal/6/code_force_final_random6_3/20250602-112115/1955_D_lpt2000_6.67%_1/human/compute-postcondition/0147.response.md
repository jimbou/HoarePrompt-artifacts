Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer less than n, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between all elements of aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, nabors is at least 3, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], D[out_aa] is decreased by 1 if D[out_aa] > 0, otherwise E[out_aa] is decreased by 1, C[in_aa] is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], otherwise D[in_aa] is increased by 1, E[in_aa] is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is not greater than 0, and this is printed: fnd which is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0**
