Output State: **`nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k, where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.**

In this output state, the value of `nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains a series of test cases, but one test case has been removed because it was used to assign the value to `nabors`. Each remaining test case still consists of three lines, with the same constraints on the values of n, m, k, a_i, and b_i.
