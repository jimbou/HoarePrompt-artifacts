Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of at least `n` integers, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between `aa` and `bb`, `fnd` is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` is empty, `nabors` is at least 1. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then the element `out_aa` is no longer present in the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `D` is decreased by 1, the count of `out_aa` in `C` is increased by 1, and `tot` is decreased by 1. If the total count of common elements is less than `k`, then `fnd` is 0, otherwise `fnd` is 1. The current value of `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0. If the current value of `C[in_aa]` is equal to the current value of `D[in_aa]` plus 1, then the current value of `C[in_aa]` is equal to the current value of `D[in_aa]` plus 1. Otherwise, the count of `in_aa` in `C` is not equal to the count of `in_aa` in `D`, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `tot` is increased by 1.**
