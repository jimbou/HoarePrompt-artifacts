Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m+1 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 2, in_aa is the last element in aa[m+1:] if C[in_aa] is greater than 0, otherwise in_aa is the last element in aa[m+2:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m - 1]
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer less than n, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m+1 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 2, in_aa is the first element in aa[m:], out_aa is the first element in aa[:n - m].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer equal to m+1, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m+2 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 2, in_aa is the second element in aa[m:], out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer equal to m+1, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n+1 integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m+2 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 2, in_aa is the third element in aa[m:], out_aa is the third element in aa[:n - m]. If the count of out_aa in D is greater than 0, the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is increased by 1. If the count of out_aa in D is 0, the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], the count of in_aa in C is increased by 1. Otherwise, D[in_aa] is increased by 1. If C[in_aa] is 0, the count of in_aa in E is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
