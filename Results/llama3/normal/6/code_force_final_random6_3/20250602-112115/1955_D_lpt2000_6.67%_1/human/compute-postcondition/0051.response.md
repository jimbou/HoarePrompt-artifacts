Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m+1 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least k, otherwise 0, stdin is empty, nabors is at least 2, in_aa is the last element in aa[m+1:] if C[in_aa] is greater than 0, otherwise in_aa is the last element in aa[m+2:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m - 1]**
