Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the value of `fnd`, which is an integer that indicates whether the total count of common elements between `aa` and `bb` is at least `k`.

Since `fnd` is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least `k`, and 0 otherwise, the output will be either 1 or 0.

Output: **1 if the total count of common elements between aa and bb is at least k, otherwise 0**
