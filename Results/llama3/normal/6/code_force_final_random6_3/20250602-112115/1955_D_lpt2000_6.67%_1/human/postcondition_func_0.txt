This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers (n, m, and k), the second line contains n integers (a_1 to a_n), and the third line contains m integers (b_1 to b_m). It then calculates the number of times a sliding window of size m in the list a_1 to a_n has at least k common elements with the list b_1 to b_m. The function prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.
