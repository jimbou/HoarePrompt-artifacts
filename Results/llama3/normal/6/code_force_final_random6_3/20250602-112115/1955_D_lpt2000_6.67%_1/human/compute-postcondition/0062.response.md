Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` integers, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m+1` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements and their counts between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements and their counts in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the counts of common elements between `aa` and `bb`, `fnd` is 1 if the total count of common elements is at least `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` is empty, `nabors` is at least 2, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]. If the count of `out_aa` in `D` is greater than 0, then if the count of `out_aa` in `E` is greater than 0, the count of `out_aa` in `E` is set to 0. Otherwise, the count of `out_aa` in `D` is decreased by 1 and the count of `out_aa` in `C` is increased by 1. If the count of `out_aa` in `D` is 0, the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. The current value of `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0.***
