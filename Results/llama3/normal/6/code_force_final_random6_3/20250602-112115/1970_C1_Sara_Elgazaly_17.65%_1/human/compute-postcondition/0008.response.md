Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `s` is True, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `lst` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The variable `s` is assigned the value `True`. The stdin remains empty as no input was taken.
