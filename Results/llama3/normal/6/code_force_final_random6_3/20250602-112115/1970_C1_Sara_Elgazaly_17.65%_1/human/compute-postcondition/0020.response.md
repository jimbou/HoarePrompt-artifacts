Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer that was the last element in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `lst[1]` is not empty but has one less element than before, `s` is True, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is equal to `y`.**

Here is the description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `y` has been updated to the last element in the list `lst[x]`. The list `lst[x]` has been modified by removing its last element. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that if `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is equal to `y` still holds.
