Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer that was the last element of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[x]` has at least one element, `lst[1]` is not empty, `s` is False, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is equal to `y`. The last element of `lst[x]` has been removed.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of `lst[x]` before the removal, and the last element of `lst[x]` has been removed. The other variables and conditions remain the same.
