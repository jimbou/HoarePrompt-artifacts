The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Since `x` is 1, this operation affects the list `lst[1]`. The value of `y` is updated to the last element that was in `lst[1]`, and the list `lst[1]` is now one element shorter.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[1]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[1]` is at least one element shorter than before, `s` is True, stdin is empty.**
