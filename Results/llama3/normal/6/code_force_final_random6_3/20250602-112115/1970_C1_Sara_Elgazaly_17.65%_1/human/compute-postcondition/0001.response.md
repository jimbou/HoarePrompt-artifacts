To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 2 (since the range is `x - 1`).

State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `y` is 1, `lst` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains `x-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`**
