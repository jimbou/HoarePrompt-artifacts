Output State: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 4, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, stdin contains x-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, a is an integer, b is an integer, lst[a] contains b, lst[b] contains a**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, `lst`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b` are updated as follows:

*   `x` remains an integer greater than or equal to 4, as its value is not modified by the code.
*   `y` remains 1, as its value is not modified by the code.
*   `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers. The code appends `b` to `lst[a]` and `a` to `lst[b]`, so `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`.
*   `stdin` contains `x-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`, as the code reads one line from `stdin` containing two integers `a` and `b`.
*   `a` is an integer, and its value is updated to the first integer read from `stdin`.
*   `b` is an integer, and its value is updated to the second integer read from `stdin`.
