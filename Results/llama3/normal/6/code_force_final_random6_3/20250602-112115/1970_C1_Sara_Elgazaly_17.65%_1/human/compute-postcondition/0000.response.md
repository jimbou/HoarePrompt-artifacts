Output State: **x is an integer equal to n, y is 1, lst is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.**

Explanation:
The first line of the code assigns the values of the first two integers from stdin to `x` and `y`. Since `n` is an integer and `t` is 1, `x` becomes `n` and `y` becomes 1. The second line initializes an empty dictionary `lst` using the `defaultdict` function from the `collections` module. This dictionary is initially empty and does not contain any key-value pairs.

The code does not modify the remaining inputs in stdin, so they remain unchanged. The `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and the final integer `u_1` are still present in stdin.

In summary, the code assigns the values of `n` and `t` to `x` and `y`, initializes an empty dictionary `lst`, and leaves the remaining inputs in stdin unchanged.
