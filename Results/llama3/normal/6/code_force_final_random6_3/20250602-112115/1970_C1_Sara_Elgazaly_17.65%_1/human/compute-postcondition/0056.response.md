Output State: **`x` is the last element that was in `lst[1]`, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[1]` is empty, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `lst` and its sublists, as well as the values of `x` and `y`, are still the same. The stdin is still empty.
