Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer that was the last element of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `lst[1]` is not empty but has one less element than before, `s` is False, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` has one less element than before because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the list. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
