Output State: **x is an integer equal to 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, stdin is empty**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable x is equal to 1, the variable y remains unchanged at 1, the dictionary lst contains all the edges from the input graph, and the standard input stream stdin is empty because all the input lines have been processed.
