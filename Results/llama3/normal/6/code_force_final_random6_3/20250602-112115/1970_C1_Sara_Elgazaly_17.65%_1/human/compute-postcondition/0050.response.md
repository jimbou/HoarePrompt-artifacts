Postcondition: ***`x` is the last element that was in `lst[1]`, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[1]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[1]` is at least one element shorter than before, `s` is True, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is the last element that was in `lst[1]` and `y` is the last element that was in `lst[1]`.***
