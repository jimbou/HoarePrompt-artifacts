Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer that was the last element of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `lst[1]` is not empty but has one less element than before, `s` is False, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is equal to `y`.***
