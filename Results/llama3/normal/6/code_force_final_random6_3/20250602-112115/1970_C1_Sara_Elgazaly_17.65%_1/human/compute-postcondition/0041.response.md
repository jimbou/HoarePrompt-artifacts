According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable lst[x].  If lst[x] is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, lst[x] is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time lst[x] must not be empty. The variable x is an integer, so x must be equal to a key in lst where the value is not empty. There is one such key in the state, which is 1. So x must be equal to 1.
State: **`x` is 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[1]` is not empty, `s` is True, stdin is empty**
