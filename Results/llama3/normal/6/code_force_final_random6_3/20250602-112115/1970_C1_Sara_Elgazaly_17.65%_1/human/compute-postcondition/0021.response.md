Output State: **x is an integer equal to y, y is an integer that was the last element in lst[y], lst is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, lst[y] has one less element than before, lst[1] is not empty but has one less element than before, s is True, stdin is empty.**

The first line assigns the value of y to x, making x equal to y. The second line, break, does not affect any variables. Since x is now equal to y, lst[x] is the same as lst[y], and it has one less element than before. The state of lst[1] remains unchanged, as it is not empty but has one less element than before. The value of s remains True, and stdin remains empty.
