Output State: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 3, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, stdin contains x-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, a is an integer, b is an integer**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It then appends `b` to the list of values for key `a` in the dictionary `lst`, and appends `a` to the list of values for key `b` in the dictionary `lst`. This means that the dictionary `lst` now contains two new key-value pairs, where the keys are the values of `a` and `b`, and the values are lists containing the other integer. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains x-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.
