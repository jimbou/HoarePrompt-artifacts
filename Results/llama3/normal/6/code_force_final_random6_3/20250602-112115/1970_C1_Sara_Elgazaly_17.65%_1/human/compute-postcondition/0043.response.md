The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Since `x` is 1, this means that the last element is removed from the list `lst[1]`.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[1]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, `lst[1]` is one element shorter than before, `s` is True, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this means that the value of `y` is now the last element that was in the list `lst[1]`, and the list `lst[1]` is one element shorter than before. The other variables remain unchanged.
