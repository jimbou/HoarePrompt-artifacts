The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, x must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 3, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is a list of integers, stdin contains x-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**
