The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, which is greater than 0 since `nums` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1.
State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw, cw is True**
