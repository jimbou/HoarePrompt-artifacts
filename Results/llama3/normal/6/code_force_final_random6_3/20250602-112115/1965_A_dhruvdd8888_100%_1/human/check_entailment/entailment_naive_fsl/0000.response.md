Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the `nums` list and the `cw` variable.

The `nums` list is calculated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the previous elements from each element. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the number of stones remaining in each pile after each move.

The `cw` variable is used to keep track of whether it's Alice's turn or Bob's turn. However, the program does not correctly update the `cw` variable based on the number of stones remaining in each pile.

A counterexample is the input:

```
2
1 7
```

The program outputs "Bob", but the correct output is "Alice". The correct sequence of moves is:

* Alice removes 1 stone from the first pile, leaving 0 stones.
* Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

The program does not correctly handle this case because it does not correctly calculate the number of stones remaining in each pile after each move.
