Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. It then modifies the list of stones by subtracting the sum of the first i elements from each element, which effectively calculates the number of stones that can be removed in each turn. The program then checks the modified list from right to left, and if the second last element is 1, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'. This logic is correct based on the problem description, which states that the first player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Correctness: **True**
