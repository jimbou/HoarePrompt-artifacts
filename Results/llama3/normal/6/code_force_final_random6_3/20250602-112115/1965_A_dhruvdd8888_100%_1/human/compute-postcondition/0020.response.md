Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If nums[i] is 1, then nw is equal to the opposite of cw which was False if nums[i+1] is 1, otherwise cw was True, and cw is updated to its opposite value. Otherwise, nw is set to True and cw is set to True. nw is now equal to cw.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that nw is now equal to cw. This means that nw has been updated to have the same value as cw, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
