Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, nw is equal to True, cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cw` has been changed to True, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `nums` is still a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements. The variable `ls` is still equal to the sum of all elements of the original list. The variable `i` is still equal to `len(nums) - 3`. The variable `nw` is still equal to `cw`, which is now True. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
