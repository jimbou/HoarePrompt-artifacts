Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with the first element being 0, ls is equal to the sum of the first two elements of the original list, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of N remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list 'nums' is still a sorted list of n+1 positive integers, but its second element (at index 1) has been modified. The variable 'ls' now holds the sum of the first two elements of the original list. The value of 'i' remains 1. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, leaving t-1 test cases.
