Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `nums` will have all its elements reduced by the cumulative sum of the original list, and the variable `ls` will hold the total sum of the original list. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of the list minus one. The other variables, `N` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
