Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, nw is equal to cw, cw is the opposite of its previous value which was False if nums[i+1] is 1, otherwise cw was True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of cw has been updated to be the opposite of its previous value, which was determined by whether nums[i+1] is 1 or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
