Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, nw is equal to cw, cw is False if nums[i] is 1, otherwise cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of N remains the same as a positive integer. The list nums remains the same as a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements. The value of ls remains the same as the sum of all elements of the original list. The value of i remains the same as len(nums) - 2. The value of nw is updated to be equal to cw. The value of cw depends on the value of nums[i], if nums[i] is 1, then cw is False, otherwise cw is True. The stdin contains t-1 test cases.
