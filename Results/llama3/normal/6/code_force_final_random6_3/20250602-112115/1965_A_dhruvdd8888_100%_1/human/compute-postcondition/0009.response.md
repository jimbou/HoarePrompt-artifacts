To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is at least 3, because the loop starts from `len(nums) - 2` and goes down to 1. 

State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, nw is True, cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
