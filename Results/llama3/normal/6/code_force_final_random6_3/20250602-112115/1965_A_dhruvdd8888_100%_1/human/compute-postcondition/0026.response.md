Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is 1, nw is equal to cw, cw is False if nums[i] is 1, otherwise cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that N remains a positive integer, nums remains a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls remains equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is now 1, nw is equal to cw, and cw is False if nums[i] is 1, otherwise cw is True. The state of stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 test cases.
