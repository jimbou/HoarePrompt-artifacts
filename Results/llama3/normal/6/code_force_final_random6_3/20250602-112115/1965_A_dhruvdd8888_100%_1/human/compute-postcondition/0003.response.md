To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with the first element being 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with the first element being 0, ls is equal to the first element of the original list, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
