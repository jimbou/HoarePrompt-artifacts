Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with the first element being 0, ls is equal to the first element of the original list, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of N remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `nums` is also unchanged except for the first element, which is now 0. This is because the first line of the code subtracts the value of `ls` (which is 0) from the first element of `nums`, effectively setting it to 0. The second line then adds the new value of the first element of `nums` (which is 0) to `ls`, so `ls` remains 0. The value of `i` is also unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Finally, the state of `stdin` remains the same as the code does not read or modify it.
