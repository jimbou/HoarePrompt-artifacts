Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to True, cw is False**

The code changes the value of `cw` to the opposite of `nw`. Since `nw` is equal to `cw` initially, and `cw` is True, `nw` is also True. Therefore, `cw` becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
