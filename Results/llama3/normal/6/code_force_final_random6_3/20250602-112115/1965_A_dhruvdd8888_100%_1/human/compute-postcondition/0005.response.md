To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a sorted list of `n+1` positive integers with the first element being 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, since `nums` is a list of `n+1` positive integers, its length is `n+1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n+1`, which means `n+1` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `nums` is a sorted list of `n+1` positive integers with the first element being 0, `ls` is equal to the sum of the first two elements of the original list, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n+1` must be greater than 2**
