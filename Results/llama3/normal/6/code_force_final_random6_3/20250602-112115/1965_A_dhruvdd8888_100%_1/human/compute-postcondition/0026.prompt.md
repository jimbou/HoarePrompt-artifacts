Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is n, nw is True, cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
    if nums[i] == 1:
        cw = not nw
    else:
        cw = True
    nw = cw


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, nw is equal to cw, cw is False if nums[i] is 1, otherwise cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If nums[i] is 1, then nw is equal to the opposite of cw which was False if nums[i+1] is 1, otherwise cw was True, and cw is updated to its opposite value. Otherwise, nw is set to True and cw is set to True. nw is now equal to cw.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw. If nums[i] is equal to 1, then nw is False. Otherwise, nw is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
