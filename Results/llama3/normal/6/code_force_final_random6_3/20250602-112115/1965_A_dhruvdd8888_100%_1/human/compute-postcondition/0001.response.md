The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers, ls is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has at least 1 element and i is now 0. 
State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 1 element, ls is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0**
