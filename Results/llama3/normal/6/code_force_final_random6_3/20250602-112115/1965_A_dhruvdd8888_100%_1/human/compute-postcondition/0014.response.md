Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, nw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False. Otherwise, cw remains True.***
