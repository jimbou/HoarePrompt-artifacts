Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers, ls is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of N is a positive integer, which was obtained from the first input in the test case. The set nums initially contained n positive integers from the second input in the test case, but the string '0' was added to it. After sorting the set in ascending order and converting its elements to integers, nums became a sorted list of n+1 positive integers. The variable ls was initialized to 0 and remained unchanged throughout the execution of the code. Finally, since one test case has been processed, stdin now contains t-1 test cases.
