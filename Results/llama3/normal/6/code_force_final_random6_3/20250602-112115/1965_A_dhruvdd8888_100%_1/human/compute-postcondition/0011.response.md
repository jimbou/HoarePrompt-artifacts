Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, nw is True, cw is False, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of nums[i] is 1**

The code `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the opposite of `nw`. Since `nw` is `True`, `cw` becomes `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of the program is updated to reflect the new value of `cw`.
