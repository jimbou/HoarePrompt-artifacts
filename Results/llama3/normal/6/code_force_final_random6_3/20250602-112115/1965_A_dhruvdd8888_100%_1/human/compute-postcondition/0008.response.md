Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is n, nw is True, cw is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a boolean value to a variable. The first line sets `nw` to `True`, and the second line sets `cw` to `True`. These assignments do not affect any of the existing variables or the state of the input. The values of `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The only additions to the state are the new variables `nw` and `cw`, both of which are now `True`.
