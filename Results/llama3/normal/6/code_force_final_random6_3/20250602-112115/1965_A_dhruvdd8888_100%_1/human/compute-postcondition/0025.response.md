Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers with all elements reduced by the sum of the first i elements of the original list and must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements of the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw. If nums[i] is equal to 1, then nw is False. Otherwise, nw is True.**

In this output state, the value of nw has been updated to be equal to cw. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of nw is now dependent on the value of nums[i]. If nums[i] is equal to 1, then nw is False, otherwise, nw is True.
