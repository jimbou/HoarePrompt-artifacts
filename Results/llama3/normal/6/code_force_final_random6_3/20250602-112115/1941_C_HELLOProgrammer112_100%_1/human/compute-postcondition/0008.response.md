The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 2. So for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 2.
State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input value, `s` is a string equal to the input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 4, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' minus the occurrences of 'mapie' is printed, which is `x + y - z`**
