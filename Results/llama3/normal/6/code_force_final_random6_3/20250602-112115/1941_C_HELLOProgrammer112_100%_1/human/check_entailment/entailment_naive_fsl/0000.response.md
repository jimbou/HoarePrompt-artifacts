Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "mapiepie", the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 3. This is because the program only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, but it does not consider the case where "mapie" appears multiple times in the string.

In this case, the program will count "mapie" as one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", but it will not count the second "pie" that appears after "mapie". Therefore, the program will output 2, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly count the occurrences of "mapie" and "pie" in the string. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated string searching algorithm, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, to find all occurrences of "mapie" and "pie" in the string.
