The code prints the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the input string s, minus the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s.
Output: **a is an integer equal to the input value, s is a string equal to the input string, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s, _ is 1, t is greater than 0 and decreased by 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' minus the occurrences of 'mapie' is printed, which is x + y - z**
