Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string s, and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
