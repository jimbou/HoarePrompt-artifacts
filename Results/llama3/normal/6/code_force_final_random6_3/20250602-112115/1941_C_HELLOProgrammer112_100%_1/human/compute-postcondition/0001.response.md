The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `a`, then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in `s` and assigns these counts to `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively.

Output State: **a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^4), s is a string, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s, _ is 0, t is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
