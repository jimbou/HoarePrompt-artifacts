Output State: **a is an integer equal to the input value, s is a string equal to the input string, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s, _ is 2, t is greater than 0 and decreased by 4, stdin contains t-8 test cases.**

The code snippet reads an integer and a string from the input, and then counts the occurrences of 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated accordingly. The value of `t` is decreased by 4, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is updated to `t-8`. The sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' minus the occurrences of 'mapie' is printed, which is `x + y - z`.
