To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`, which should contain an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, _ is 0, t is greater than 0**
