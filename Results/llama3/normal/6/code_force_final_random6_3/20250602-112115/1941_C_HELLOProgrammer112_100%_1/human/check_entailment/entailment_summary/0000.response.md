Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n`.

2. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string `s`.

3. The program then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie'. This is the correct logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string `s` beautiful.

   - If 'map' or 'pie' appears in the string, it needs to be deleted, so we add the counts of 'map' and 'pie'.
   - However, if 'mapie' appears in the string, it contains both 'map' and 'pie', so we have counted it twice. Therefore, we subtract the count of 'mapie' to avoid double counting.

4. The program processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
