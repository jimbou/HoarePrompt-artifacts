Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The provided program uses the count() method to count the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the input string. It then prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie".

Here's why this approach is correct:

* The count() method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. This means that if a string contains multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie", they will be counted separately.
* By subtracting the count of "mapie" from the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie", we are effectively removing the overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" that are part of the substring "mapie". This is because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", so counting it separately would result in double-counting.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
