Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = n - 1. In this case, the program should output a sequence of numbers that are all equal, but the program outputs a sequence of numbers from 1 to n. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program outputs [1, 2, 3], but the correct output should be [1, 1, 1] or any other sequence of three equal numbers.
