The code prints the elements of the list `res` as separate values, without any separators or formatting. The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the list `res` into individual arguments to the `print` function.

Since the exact values of the integers in the list `res` are not provided in the precondition, we can't compute the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list of integers in `res`.

Output: **the list of integers in res**
