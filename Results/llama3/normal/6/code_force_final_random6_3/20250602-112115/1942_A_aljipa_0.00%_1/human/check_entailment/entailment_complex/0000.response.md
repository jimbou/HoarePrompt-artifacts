Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly handles the three cases described in the problem:

1. If k is equal to n, the program generates a list of all ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.

2. If k is equal to 1, the program generates a list of numbers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.

3. For all other cases, the program generates a list containing a single -1, which indicates that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program correctly reads the input from standard input, processes the test cases, and prints the results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
