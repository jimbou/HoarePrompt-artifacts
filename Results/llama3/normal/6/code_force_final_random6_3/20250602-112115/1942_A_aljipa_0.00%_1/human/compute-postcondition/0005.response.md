The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than t the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and t is greater than 1.
State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers, and the elements of the list res are being printed**
