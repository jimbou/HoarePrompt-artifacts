Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers: n and k. It then generates a list of integers based on the values of n and k, and prints the list. If k is equal to n, the list contains all ones. If k is equal to 1, the list contains the numbers from 0 to n-1. For all other cases, the list contains a single -1. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.**
