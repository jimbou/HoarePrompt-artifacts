Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases based on the values of n and k.

* If k is equal to n, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program generates a list of all ones, which satisfies the condition because all cyclic shifts of a list of all ones are sorted.
* If k is equal to 1, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program generates a list of numbers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition because only one cyclic shift (the original list itself) is sorted.
* For all other cases, the program generates a list containing a single -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases based on the values of n and k.

Correctness: **True**
