Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers**.

The code block first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Then, it initializes a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones. If `k` is 1, `res` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` is a list containing a single -1. The variable `_` remains unchanged, and `t` is not affected by the code block.
