The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list.

Since the exact elements of the `res` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `res` list.

Output: **elements of the res list (where res is a list of integers)**
