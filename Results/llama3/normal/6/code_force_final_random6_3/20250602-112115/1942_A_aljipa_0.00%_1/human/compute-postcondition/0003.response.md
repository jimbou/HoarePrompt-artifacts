The code prints the elements of the list `res` as separate values, without any separators or formatting.
Since the exact values of the elements in the list `res` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `res`.
Output: **the elements of the list res (where res is a list of integers)**
