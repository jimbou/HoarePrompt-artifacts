The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line creates a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` is 1, `res` becomes a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing a single -1.

Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers, and the list of integers in res is being printed.**
