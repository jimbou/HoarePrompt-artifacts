Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers**

The code snippet first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line of the code then uses a conditional expression to determine the value of `res`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` is equal to 1, `res` becomes a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing a single -1. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
