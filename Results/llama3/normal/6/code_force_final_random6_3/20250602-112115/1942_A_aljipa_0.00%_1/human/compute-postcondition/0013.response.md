Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers, and the list of integers in res is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `t` is still the number of test cases, but it can be any non-negative integer (including 0). The variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `n` and `k` are still integers, and the list `res` is still a list of integers. However, the list `res` is no longer being printed, as the loop has finished executing.
