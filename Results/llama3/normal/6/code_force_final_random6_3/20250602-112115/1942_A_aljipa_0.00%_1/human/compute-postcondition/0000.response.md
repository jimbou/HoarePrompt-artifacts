The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input (an integer) to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first input is the number of test cases, `t` is now equal to the number of test cases.

The stdin now contains one input: a series of pairs of integers (n and k).

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains one input: a series of pairs of integers (n and k)**
