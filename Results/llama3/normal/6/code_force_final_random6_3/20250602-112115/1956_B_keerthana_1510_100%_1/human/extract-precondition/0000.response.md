Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times.**
