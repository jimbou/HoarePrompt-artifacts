Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 2*t + 1 lines, line is the (2*t + 1)th line, and the difference between the number of tokens in the (2*t + 1)th line and the number of unique tokens in the (2*t + 1)th line is being printed**

This output state means that the loop has executed for all test cases, and the file object `open(0)` has at least `2*t + 1` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop is currently processing the `(2*t + 1)`th line, and it is printing the difference between the number of tokens in that line and the number of unique tokens in that line.
