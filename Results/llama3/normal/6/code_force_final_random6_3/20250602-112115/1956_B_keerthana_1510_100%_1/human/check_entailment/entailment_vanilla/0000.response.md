Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads input from standard input (file descriptor 0) using the `open(0)` function. The `[2::2]` slice notation is used to read every other line starting from the third line (index 2). This is because the input format consists of pairs of lines, where the first line contains the number of cards and the second line contains the card values.

2. For each pair of lines, the program splits the second line into a list of card values using the `split()` method. This list is assigned to the variable `tokens`.

3. The program then calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored by subtracting the number of unique card values (obtained using the set comprehension `{*tokens}`) from the total number of card values (obtained using `len(tokens)`). This is because the maximum number of points that can be scored is equal to the number of duplicate card values.

4. Finally, the program prints the calculated maximum number of points.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
