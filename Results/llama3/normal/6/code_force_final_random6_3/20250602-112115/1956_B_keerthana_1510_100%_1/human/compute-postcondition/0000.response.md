The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and the file object open(0). So we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object open(0). If the file object has at least 2 lines the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the file object must have at least 2 lines and the line is the 3rd line.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 2 lines, line is the 3rd line**
