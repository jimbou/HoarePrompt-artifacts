Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 2 lines, line is the 3rd line, and this is printed: the difference between the number of tokens in the 3rd line and the number of unique tokens in the 3rd line

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 5 lines, line is the 5th line, and the difference between the number of tokens in the 5th line and the number of unique tokens in the 5th line is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 7 lines, line is the 7th line, and the difference between the number of tokens in the 7th line and the number of unique tokens in the 7th line is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
