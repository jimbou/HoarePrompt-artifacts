Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `line` is the 5th line from the file object `open(0)`, which is a file object that must have at least 5 lines.
2. `tokens := line.split()` splits the 5th line into a list of tokens (words or substrings separated by whitespace). The `:=` operator is used to assign the result to a new variable `tokens`.
3. `len(tokens)` calculates the number of tokens in the list.
4. `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens, which removes duplicates. The `*` operator is used to unpack the list into a set.
5. `len({*tokens})` calculates the number of unique tokens in the set.
6. The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.

Based on the precondition, we can describe the output as:

Output: **the difference between the number of tokens in the 5th line and the number of unique tokens in the 5th line**

In other words, the output will be an integer value representing the difference between the total number of words or substrings in the 5th line and the number of distinct words or substrings in the same line.
