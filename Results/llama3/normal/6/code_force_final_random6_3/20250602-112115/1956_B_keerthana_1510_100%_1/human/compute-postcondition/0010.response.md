Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the difference between the total number of integers and the number of unique integers in each test case. It assumes that the input is well-formed, with the first line containing the number of test cases, and each test case consisting of two lines: the first line containing a single integer (n), and the second line containing n integers. The function does not perform any error checking or handling.**
