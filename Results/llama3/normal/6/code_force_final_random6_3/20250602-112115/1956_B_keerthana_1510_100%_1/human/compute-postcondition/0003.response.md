The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and open(0), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the open(0).  If the open(0) has at least 5 lines the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, open(0) has at least 4 lines, line is the 3rd line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the open(0) must have at least 5 lines and the line is the 5th line.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 5 lines, line is the 5th line, and this is printed: the difference between the number of tokens in the 5th line and the number of unique tokens in the 5th line**
