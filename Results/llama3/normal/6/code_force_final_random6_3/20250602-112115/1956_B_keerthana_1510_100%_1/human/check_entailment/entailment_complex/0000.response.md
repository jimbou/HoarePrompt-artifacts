Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the difference between the total number of integers and the number of unique integers in each test case.

The program uses a clever trick to calculate the maximum number of points that can be scored. By subtracting the number of unique integers from the total number of integers, it effectively counts the number of pairs of identical integers. Since each pair can be used to score a point, this difference represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.

The program assumes that the input is well-formed, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. It does not perform any error checking or handling, but this is not necessary given the constraints of the problem.

Overall, the program is correct and effectively solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
