Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= `k` <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), and the third line contains `n` integers `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n` (-`n` <= `x_1` < `x_2` < ... < `x_n` <= `n`; `x_i` != 0). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is an empty list, bullets_used is the sum of all health values in monsters, can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k for any iteration, otherwise can_survive is True, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is an empty list, bullets_used is the sum of the health values of all monsters, can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is more than distance * k for any monster, otherwise can_survive is True, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is an empty list, bullets_used is the sum of all the second elements of the tuples in the initial monsters list, can_survive is False if there exists a tuple in the initial monsters list where the sum of bullets_used and the second element of the tuple is greater than the product of the absolute value of the first element of the tuple and k, otherwise can_survive is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether can_survive is True or False




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
