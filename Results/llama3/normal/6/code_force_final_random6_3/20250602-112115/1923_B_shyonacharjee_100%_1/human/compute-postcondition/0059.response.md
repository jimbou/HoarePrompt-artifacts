Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element and must have at least 3 tuples, pos is the first element of the third tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the first element of the third tuple in monsters, bullets_used is the sum of the second element of the third tuple in monsters and health, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the second element of the third tuple in monsters and health. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains unchanged.***
