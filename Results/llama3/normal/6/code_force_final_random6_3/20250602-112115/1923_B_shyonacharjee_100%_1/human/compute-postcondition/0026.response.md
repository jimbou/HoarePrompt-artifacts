Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 1 monster, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, pos is the position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of bullets_used and the health of the first monster, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive. The current value of total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k.**
