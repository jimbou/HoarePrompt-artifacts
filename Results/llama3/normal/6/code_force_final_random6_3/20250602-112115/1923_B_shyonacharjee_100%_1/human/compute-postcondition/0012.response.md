Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from x and a that must have at least 2 tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the previous bullets_used and health, pos is the second smallest pos value in monsters, health is the health value corresponding to the second smallest pos value in monsters, distance is the absolute value of pos, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and health. If total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True.***
