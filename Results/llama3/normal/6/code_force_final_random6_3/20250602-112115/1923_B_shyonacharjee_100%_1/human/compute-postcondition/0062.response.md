The code prints 'YES' if the value of `can_survive` is True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `can_survive` is determined by the condition that checks if there exists a tuple in the initial `monsters` list where the sum of `bullets_used` and the second element of the tuple is greater than the product of the absolute value of the first element of the tuple and `k`. If such a tuple exists, `can_survive` is False, otherwise it is True.

Since the `monsters` list is empty, the condition will always be False, and `can_survive` will be True. Therefore, the code will print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
