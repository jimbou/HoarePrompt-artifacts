Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element and must have at least one tuple, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` and 0, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` and 0. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, the state of `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `bullets_used` has been updated to be the sum of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` and 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
