The code prints 'YES' if the total bullets needed to kill all monsters is less than or equal to the distance multiplied by the number of bullets that can be used per unit distance for all monsters, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where total_bullets_needed is the sum of the health values of all monsters, distance is the distance between the player and the monster, and k is the number of bullets that can be used per unit distance.
Output: **YES if total_bullets_needed is less than or equal to distance * k for all monsters, otherwise NO**
