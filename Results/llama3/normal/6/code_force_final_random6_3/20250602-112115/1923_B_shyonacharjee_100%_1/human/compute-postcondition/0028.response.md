Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 1 monster, bullets_used is 0, if total_bullets_needed is more than distance * k, can_survive is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
