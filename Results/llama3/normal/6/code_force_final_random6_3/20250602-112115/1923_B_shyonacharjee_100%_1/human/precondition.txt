stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n. 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9, 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
