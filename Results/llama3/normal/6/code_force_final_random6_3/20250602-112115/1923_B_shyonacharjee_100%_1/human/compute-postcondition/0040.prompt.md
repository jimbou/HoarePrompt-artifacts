Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 1 monster, bullets_used is increased by health, if total_bullets_needed is more than distance * k, can_survive is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 2 monsters, bullets_used is increased by health, pos is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next monster, health is the health value of the next monster, distance is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of bullets_used and health. If total_bullets_needed is more than distance * k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 3 monsters, `bullets_used` is increased by `health`, `pos` is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next monster, `health` is the health value of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is more than `distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
