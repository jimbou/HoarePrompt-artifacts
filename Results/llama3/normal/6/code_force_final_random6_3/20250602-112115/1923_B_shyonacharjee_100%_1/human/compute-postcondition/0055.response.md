Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element and must have at least 2 tuples, pos is the first element of the second tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the first element of the second tuple in monsters, bullets_used is the sum of the second element of the second tuple in monsters, health, and 0, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the second element of the second tuple in monsters and health. If total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t, n, k, a, x, monsters, pos, distance, and total_bullets_needed remains unchanged. The value of bullets_used is increased by health. The value of can_survive is updated based on the new value of total_bullets_needed.
