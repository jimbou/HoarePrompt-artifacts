Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 3 monsters, bullets_used is increased by health, pos is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next monster, health is the health value of the next monster, distance is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of bullets_used and health, can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is more than distance * k, otherwise can_survive remains unchanged.***
