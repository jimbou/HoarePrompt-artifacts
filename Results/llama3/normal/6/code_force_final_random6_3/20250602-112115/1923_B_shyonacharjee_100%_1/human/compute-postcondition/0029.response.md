Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing the absolute difference between the coordinates and the health values of the monsters that must have at least 1 monster, bullets_used is increased by health, if total_bullets_needed is more than distance * k, can_survive is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of bullets_used has been increased by the value of health. All other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is still t - 3. The value of t is still between 2 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive). The value of _ is still 1. The values of n, k, a, x, and monsters are still the same. If the total number of bullets needed is more than the distance multiplied by k, the program prints 'NO' and sets can_survive to False.
