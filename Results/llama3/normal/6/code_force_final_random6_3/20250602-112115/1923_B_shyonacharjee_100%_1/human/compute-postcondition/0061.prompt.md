Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element and must have at least one tuple, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` and 0, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` and 0. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, the state of `can_survive` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, monsters is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element and must have at least 2 tuples, pos is the first element of the second tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the first element of the second tuple in monsters, bullets_used is the sum of the second element of the second tuple in monsters, health, and 0, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the second element of the second tuple in monsters and health. If total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples of integers sorted by the absolute value of the first element and must have at least 3 tuples, `pos` is the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `health`, and `health`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the second element of the third tuple in `monsters` and `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
