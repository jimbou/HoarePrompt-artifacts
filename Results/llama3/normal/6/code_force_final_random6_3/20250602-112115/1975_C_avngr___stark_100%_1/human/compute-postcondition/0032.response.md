According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 2`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1. 

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` is 0**
