To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `t` is at least 2

The other variables, such as `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `i`, `temp`, and `max`, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 2, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, `max` is the maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a, and the maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a is printed**
