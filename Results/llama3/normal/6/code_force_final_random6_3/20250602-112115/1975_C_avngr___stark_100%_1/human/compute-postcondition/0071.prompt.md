Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: an integer `n` and `n` space-separated integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, max is the maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a, and the maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is -1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` is the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in `a`, and the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in `a` which is `max` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 3, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, and max is the maximum value of the second element of temp, and the maximum value of the second element of temp which is max is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
