Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index 1, and max is the maximum value of the second element of temp so far. If the second element of temp is greater than max, then max is updated to the second element of temp.***
