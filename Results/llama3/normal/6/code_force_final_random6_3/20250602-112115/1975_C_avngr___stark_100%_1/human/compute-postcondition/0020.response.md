Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index 2, `max` is `temp[1]`**.

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be equal to `temp[1]`, which is the middle element of the sorted list `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
