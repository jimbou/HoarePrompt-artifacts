Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, and max is 0.**

In this output state, the value of max has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values. The maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a is no longer printed, and no additional operations are performed.
