Based on the initial state, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `t` is at least 1, but its value is not explicitly given, so we can't determine its exact value.
* `_` is 0, but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
* `n` is an integer equal to 2.
* `a` is a list of 2 integers, but the specific values of these integers are not given.

The print statement is `print(min(a))`. This will print the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Since we don't know the specific values of the integers in `a`, we can't determine the exact output of the print statement. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the smallest integer in the list a**
