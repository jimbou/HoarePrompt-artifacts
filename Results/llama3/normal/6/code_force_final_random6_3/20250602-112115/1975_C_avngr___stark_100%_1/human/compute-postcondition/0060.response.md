To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, the condition `i < n - 2` must still be true. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `stdin`, `temp`, and `max`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index 0, and `max` is the maximum value of the second element of `temp` so far**
