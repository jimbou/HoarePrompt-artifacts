Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is -1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition that if `n` is 2, the minimum value of the list `a` is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, is still valid.
