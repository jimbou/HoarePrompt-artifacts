Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 2, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `i`, and `max` is the second element of `temp`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which is a subset of the list `a` starting at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties.
