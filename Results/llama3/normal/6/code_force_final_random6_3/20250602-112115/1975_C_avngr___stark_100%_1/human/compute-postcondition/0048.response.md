To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is -1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` is the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in `a`**
