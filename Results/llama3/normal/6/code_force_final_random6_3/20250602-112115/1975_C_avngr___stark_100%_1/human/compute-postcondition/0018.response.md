The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a`, `max` is `temp[1]` if `temp[1]` is greater than the original `max`, otherwise `max` remains unchanged.**
