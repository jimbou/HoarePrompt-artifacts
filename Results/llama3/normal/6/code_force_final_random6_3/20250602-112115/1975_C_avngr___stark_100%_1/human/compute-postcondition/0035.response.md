Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `i`, and `max` is equal to the second element of `temp`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `max`, which is now assigned the value of the second element of the sorted list `temp`. This means that `max` is now equal to the middle element of the three integers from `a` starting at index `i`, which is a specific value within the sorted list.
