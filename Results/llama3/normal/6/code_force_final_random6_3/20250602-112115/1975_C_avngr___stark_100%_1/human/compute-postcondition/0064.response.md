The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index 2, and `max` is the maximum value of the second element of `temp` so far. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`.**
