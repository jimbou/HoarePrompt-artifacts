Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is -1, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, and max is the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its type remains the same. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `t` remains at least 1, `_` remains 2, `i` remains -1, `temp` remains a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` remains the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in `a`.
