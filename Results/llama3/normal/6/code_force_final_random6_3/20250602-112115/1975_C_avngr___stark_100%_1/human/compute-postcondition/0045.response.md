Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is -1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` is the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains at least 2, `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer, `a` remains a list of `n` integers, and stdin remains with multiple test cases minus two. The loop variable `i` reaches -1, indicating the loop has finished. The `temp` list is the last sorted sublist of 3 consecutive integers from `a`, starting at index `n - 3`. Most importantly, `max` is updated to be the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in `a`, which is the overall maximum of the middle elements of all such sublists.
