To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the range.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `max` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
