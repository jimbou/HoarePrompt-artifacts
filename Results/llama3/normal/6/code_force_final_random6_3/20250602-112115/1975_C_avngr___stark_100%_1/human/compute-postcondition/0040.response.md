Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is at least 2, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index i. If the second element of temp is larger than the original max, then max is updated to the second element of temp. Otherwise, max remains the same.***
