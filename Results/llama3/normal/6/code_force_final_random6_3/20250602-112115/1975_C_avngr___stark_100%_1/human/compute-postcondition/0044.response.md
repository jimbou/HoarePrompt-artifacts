Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 3, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `i`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the original maximum value, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` retains its original value.**
