Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `max` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n` is equal to 2, the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `n` and the printing of the smallest integer in the list `a` are still applicable.
