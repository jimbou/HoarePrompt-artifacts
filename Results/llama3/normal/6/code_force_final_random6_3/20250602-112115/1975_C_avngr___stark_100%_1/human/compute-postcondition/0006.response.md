The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not affected, but we move on to the next test case.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to 2, `a` is a list of 2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed.**
