Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is -1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `n - 3`, and `max` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 0, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index 0, and if the second element of temp is greater than the previous value of max, then max is updated to the value of the second element of temp. Otherwise, max remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index 1, and max is the maximum value of the second element of temp so far. If the second element of temp is greater than max, then max is updated to the second element of temp.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index 2, and max is the maximum value of the second element of temp so far. If the second element of temp is greater than max, then max is updated to the second element of temp.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
