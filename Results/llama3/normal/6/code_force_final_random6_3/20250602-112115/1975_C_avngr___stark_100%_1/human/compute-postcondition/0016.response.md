Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a`, `max` is `temp[1]`**.

In this output state, the value of `max` is updated to be `temp[1]`, which is the middle element of the sorted list `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `max` is now equal to the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which is a subset of the list `a`.
