Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is -1, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, and max is the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a, and the minimum value of the list a is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the minimum value of the list `a` is still being printed.
