To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes at least 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 3, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `i`. If the second element of `temp` is larger than the original `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains the same.**
