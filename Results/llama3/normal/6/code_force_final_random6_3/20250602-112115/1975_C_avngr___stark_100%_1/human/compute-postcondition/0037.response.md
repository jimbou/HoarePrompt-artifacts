The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 2, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index `i`, and if the second element of `temp` is greater than the original value of `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`.**
