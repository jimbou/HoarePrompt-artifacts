Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 0, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index 0, and if the second element of temp is greater than the previous value of max, then max is updated to the value of the second element of temp. Otherwise, max remains unchanged.***
