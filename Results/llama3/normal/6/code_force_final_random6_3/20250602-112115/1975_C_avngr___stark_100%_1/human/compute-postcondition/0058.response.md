Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list of 3 integers from `a` starting at index 0, `max` is `temp[1]`, and the current value of `temp[1]` is greater than the previous value of `max`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` has been updated to be equal to the middle element of the sorted list `temp`, which is greater than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
