Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 0, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index 0, and max is 0**

The code snippet modifies the value of `temp`. The first line assigns a slice of `a` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 3) to `temp`. This slice contains the first three elements of `a`. The second line sorts this slice in ascending order. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged.
