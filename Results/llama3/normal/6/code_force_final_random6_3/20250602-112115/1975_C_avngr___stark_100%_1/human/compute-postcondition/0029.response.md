Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of 3 integers from a starting at index n - 3, max is the maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a, and the maximum of the middle elements of all sublists of 3 consecutive integers in a is printed, and the smallest integer in the list a is printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
