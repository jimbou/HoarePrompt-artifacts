This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum of the second elements of all sorted sublists of 3 consecutive integers in the list, and prints this maximum value. If a test case has only 2 integers, it prints the smaller of the two. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input stream empty.
