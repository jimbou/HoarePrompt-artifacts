Based on the precondition, the value of `n` determines the value of `word`. There are three cases to consider:

1. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string consisting of the `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, the possible values of `n` in this case are 53 to 78. The `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet would be the `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet starting from 'a' (the first letter of the alphabet). For example, if `n` is 53, the `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet would be 'a', if `n` is 54, the `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet would be 'b', and so on.

2. If `n` is less than or equal to 52, `word` is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if `n` is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if `n` is greater than 28. In the first case, `word` would be 'az' if `n` is less than or equal to 28. In the second case, `word` would be 'a' followed by the `(52-n)`th letter of the alphabet (starting from 'z', the last letter of the alphabet) and then 'z'. For example, if `n` is 29, `word` would be 'ayz', if `n` is 30, `word` would be 'axz', and so on.

3. If `n` is less than or equal to 27, `word` is 'aay' if `n` is 27, otherwise `word` is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the `(n-2)`th letter of the alphabet. If `n` is 27, `word` would be 'aay'. If `n` is less than 27, `word` would be 'aa' followed by the `(n-2)`th letter of the alphabet. For example, if `n` is 26, `word` would be 'aaz', if `n` is 25, `word` would be 'aay', and so on.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `word`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `word` as described above.

Output: **word (where word is a string that depends on the value of n, as described above)**
