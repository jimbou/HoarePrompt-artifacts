Based on the precondition, the value of `n` determines the value of `word`. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 78, we need to consider the different cases:

* If `n` is larger than 52, `word` is a string that contains the `(n-52)`th lowercase English letter and 'zz'. Since `n` is between 3 and 78, the possible values of `n` in this case are 53 to 78. The `(n-52)`th lowercase English letter would be the `(n-52)`th letter of the alphabet, where `n-52` ranges from 1 to 26. Therefore, `word` would be a string containing the `(n-52)`th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'.
* If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is a string of 3 characters where the first character is 'a', the second character is the `(n-27)`th letter of the alphabet, and the third character is 'z'. Since `n` is between 27 and 52, the possible values of `n` in this case are 28 to 52. The `(n-27)`th letter of the alphabet would be the `(n-27)`th letter of the alphabet, where `n-27` ranges from 1 to 25. Therefore, `word` would be a string containing 'a', the `(n-27)`th letter of the alphabet, and 'z'.
* If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'.
* Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' followed by the `(n-3)`th character of the alphabet. Since `n` is between 3 and 78, the possible values of `n` in this case are 3 to 26. The `(n-3)`th character of the alphabet would be the `(n-3)`th letter of the alphabet, where `n-3` ranges from 0 to 23. Therefore, `word` would be a string containing 'aa' followed by the `(n-3)`th letter of the alphabet.

In summary, the value of `word` depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is larger than 52, `word` contains the `(n-52)`th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` contains 'a', the `(n-27)`th letter of the alphabet, and 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` contains 'aa' followed by the `(n-3)`th letter of the alphabet.

Output: **word (where word is a string that depends on the value of n, as described above)**
