Functionality: **This function generates and prints a series of strings based on input integers. It accepts a number of test cases (t) and then t integers (n), each between 3 and 78. For each n, it constructs a string (word) according to specific rules based on the value of n relative to 27 and 52, and then prints this word. The function consumes all input from stdin and leaves it empty, producing no return value but printing the constructed words for each input integer.**
