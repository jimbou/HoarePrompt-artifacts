Output: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, stdin is empty. If n is greater than 52, word is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 52, word is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if n is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if n is greater than 28. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is 'aay' if n is 27, otherwise word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed**
