You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines, each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78).
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, i is equal to the value of t, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78. If n is greater than 52, word is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 52, word is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if n is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if n is greater than 28. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is 'aay' if n is 27, otherwise word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, i is equal to the value of t, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78. If n is greater than 52, word is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 52, word is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if n is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if n is greater than 28. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is 'aay' if n is 27, otherwise word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
