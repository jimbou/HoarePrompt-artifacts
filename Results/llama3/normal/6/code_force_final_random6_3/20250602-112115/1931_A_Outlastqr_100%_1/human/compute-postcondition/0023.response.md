The code `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is executed. The value of `n` is an integer between 3 and 78. `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters. The value of `word` is an empty string. The value of `i` is 1. stdin contains 0 inputs.

`word` is assigned the value of `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. The value of `alphabet[n - 3]` is a lowercase English letter. The value of `n` is between 3 and 78, so `n - 3` is between 0 and 75. The value of `alphabet[n - 3]` is the (n - 2)th letter of the alphabet. The value of `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. The value of `i` is not affected. stdin contains 0 inputs.

Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is 1, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78, stdin contains 0 inputs**
