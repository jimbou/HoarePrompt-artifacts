Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 26, `word` is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th to the 26th lowercase English letters, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated by concatenating 'aa' and the substring of `alphabet` starting from the (n-2)th character to the end. The value of `n` is still between 3 and 26, and the values of `alphabet` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to read the input.
