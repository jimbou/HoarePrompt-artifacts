Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, i is equal to the value of t, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78. If n is greater than 52, word is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 52, word is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if n is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if n is greater than 28. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is 'aay' if n is 27, otherwise word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables is as follows:

- `alphabet` remains unchanged as a string of all lowercase English letters.
- `stdin` is empty, meaning all inputs have been consumed.
- `i` is equal to the value of `t`, indicating the loop has executed `t` times.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, representing the last input value.
- The value of `word` depends on the last input value `n`:
  - If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 52, `word` is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if `n` is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if `n` is greater than 28.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 27, `word` is 'aay' if `n` is 27, otherwise `word` is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet.
  - The value of `word` is being printed.
