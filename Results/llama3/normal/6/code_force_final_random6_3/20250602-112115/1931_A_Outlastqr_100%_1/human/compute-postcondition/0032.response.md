The code `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` modifies the value of the variable `word`. Since `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `alphabet[n - 28]` will be a single character. The value of `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78. Since `n` is at least 1, `n - 28` will be at least -27. Since `alphabet` has 26 characters, `alphabet[n - 28]` will be a character from the end of the string if `n` is greater than 28, or it will be an empty string if `n` is less than or equal to 28.

Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, `word` is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if `n` is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of `alphabet` + 'z' if `n` is greater than 28, stdin is empty**
