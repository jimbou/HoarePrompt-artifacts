Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. The program uses the ASCII values of the letters to calculate the encoded word and then constructs the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if the encoded word is greater than 52, it correctly adds the corresponding letter to the word and appends 'zz'. If the encoded word is between 27 and 52, it correctly adds 'a' to the word and appends the corresponding letter and 'z'. If the encoded word is 27, it correctly returns 'aay'. If the encoded word is less than 27, it correctly adds 'aa' to the word and appends the corresponding letter.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if the encoded word is 3, it correctly returns 'aaa'. If the encoded word is 78, it correctly returns 'rzz'.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
