Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines, each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains 1 input: t lines, each containing an integer n, i is 0, input() is an integer value, n is an integer between 3 and 78, word is a string. If n is between 3 and 26, word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th to the 26th lowercase English letters, stdin contains 0 inputs. If n is equal to 27, then word is 'aay'. If n is between 28 and 52, word is a string that contains 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z', stdin contains 1 input: t lines, each containing an integer n. If n is higher than 52, word is a string that includes the lowercase English letter at index n - 53 in alphabet and 'zz', and this is printed: word (where word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th to the 26th lowercase English letters if n is between 3 and 26, 'aay' if n is equal to 27, 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z' if n is between 28 and 52, or the lowercase English letter at index n - 53 in alphabet and 'zz' if n is higher than 52)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 1, input() is an integer value, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer between 3 and 78. If n is larger than 52, word is a string that contains the (n-52)th lowercase English letter and 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52, word is a string of 3 characters where the first character is 'a', the second character is the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet, and the third character is 'z'. If n is 27, word is 'aay'. Otherwise, word is 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th character of alphabet, and the word is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, stdin is empty. If n is greater than 52, word is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 52, word is either 'a' + an empty string + 'z' if n is less than or equal to 28, or 'a' + a character from the end of alphabet + 'z' if n is greater than 28. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is 'aay' if n is 27, otherwise word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
