Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `stdin` contains 1 input: t lines, each containing an integer n, `i` is 0, `input()` is an integer value, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78, `word` is a string that includes the lowercase English letter at index `n - 53` in `alphabet` and 'zz'. The current value of `n` is higher than 52.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include the lowercase English letter at index `n - 53` in `alphabet` and 'zz'. The index `n - 53` is used because the current value of `n` is higher than 52, so subtracting 53 from `n` gives the correct index for the lowercase English letter in `alphabet`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
