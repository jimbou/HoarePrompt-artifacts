Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 1, input() is an integer value, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer between 3 and 78, word is an empty string**.

The code first reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`, leaving stdin empty. The second line initializes `word` as an empty string. The initial state's conditions regarding `n` and `word` are no longer applicable since `n` has been reassigned and `word` has been reset. The values of `alphabet` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
