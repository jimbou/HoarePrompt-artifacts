Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, word is an empty string, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 78, which is the value read from the input. The `word` variable has been initialized to an empty string. The `alphabet` and `i` variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` is now empty since the input has been read.
