To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `input()`.

According to the code, `input()` must return an integer value for the loop to execute. Since `stdin` contains two inputs, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure that it has at least one integer value available.

State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines, each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, input() is an integer value**
