Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first integer value from the original stdin, y is an integer equal to x - 1, i is 2, stdin contains at least one integer value minus one integer value.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was an integer, it becomes the first integer value from the original stdin. The second line assigns the value of `x - 1` to `y`, making `y` equal to the first integer value from the original stdin minus one. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and stdin now contains at least one integer value minus one integer value.
