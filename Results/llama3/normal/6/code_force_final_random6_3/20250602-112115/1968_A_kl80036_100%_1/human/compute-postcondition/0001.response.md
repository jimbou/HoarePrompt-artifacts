The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `stdin` contains at least one integer value, `x` becomes that integer value. The second line assigns the value of `x - 1` to `y`. Since `x` is now an integer value, `y` becomes that integer value minus 1.

Output State: **x is an integer value from stdin, y is x - 1, i is 0, stdin contains at least one less integer value**
