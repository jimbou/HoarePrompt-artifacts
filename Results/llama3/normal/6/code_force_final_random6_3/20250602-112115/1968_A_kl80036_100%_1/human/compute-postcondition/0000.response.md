To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `input()`.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1. Since `input()` is a function that reads from `stdin`, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure it contains at least one integer value.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer value, `i` is 0**
