Output State: **x is an integer, y is an integer equal to x - 1, i is 1, stdin contains at least one less integer value**

In this final state, the value of `x` is updated to the next integer value from `stdin`, and `y` is updated to be one less than the new value of `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The number of integer values in `stdin` is reduced by at least one due to the `input()` function reading one integer value.
