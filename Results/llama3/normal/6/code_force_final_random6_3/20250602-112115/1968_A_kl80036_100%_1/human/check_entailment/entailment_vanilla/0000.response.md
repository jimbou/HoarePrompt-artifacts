Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible.

The given program defines a function func() that takes no arguments. Inside the function, it iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to the number of test cases (t) minus 1. For each iteration, it reads an integer x from the input and calculates y as x - 1. It then prints the value of y.

The program does not explicitly calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y, nor does it check if the calculated y satisfies the condition gcd(x, y) + y being maximum possible.

However, let's analyze the program's logic:

1. For each test case, the program reads an integer x.
2. It calculates y as x - 1.
3. It prints the value of y.

Now, let's examine the example inputs and outputs:

Input:

    7
    10
    7
    21
    100
    2
    1000
    6

Output:

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

For each input x, the program outputs y = x - 1. Let's verify if this satisfies the condition gcd(x, y) + y being maximum possible:

1. x = 10, y = 9: gcd(10, 9) = 1, gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10 (maximum possible)
2. x = 7, y = 6: gcd(7, 6) = 1, gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7 (maximum possible)
3. x = 21, y = 20: gcd(21, 20) = 1, gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 21 (maximum possible)
4. x = 100, y = 99: gcd(100, 99) = 1, gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 100 (maximum possible)
5. x = 2, y = 1: gcd(2, 1) = 1, gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 (maximum possible)
6. x = 1000, y = 999: gcd(1000, 999) = 1, gcd(1000, 999) + 999 = 1000 (maximum possible)
7. x = 6, y = 5: gcd(6, 5) = 1, gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 6 (maximum possible)

In all cases, the program's output y = x - 1 satisfies the condition gcd(x, y) + y being maximum possible.

Therefore, despite the program not explicitly calculating the gcd or checking the condition, its logic is correct, and it produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
