To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If there is at least one more integer value in `stdin`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer value from `stdin`, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one less integer value, and `y` is printed.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and there must be at least one more integer value in `stdin`. Since `x` is an integer value from `stdin`, we can assume that the next integer value in `stdin` will be read and assigned to `x` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is the next integer value from `stdin`, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one less integer value**
