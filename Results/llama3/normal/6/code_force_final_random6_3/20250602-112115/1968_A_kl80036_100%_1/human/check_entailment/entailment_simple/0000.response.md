Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find any integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program simply prints x - 1 as the value of y.

The reasoning behind this is that gcd(x, x - 1) is always 1, because x and x - 1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime. So, gcd(x, x - 1) + (x - 1) = 1 + (x - 1) = x.

Since x is the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y, and x - 1 is the largest possible value of y that is less than x, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
