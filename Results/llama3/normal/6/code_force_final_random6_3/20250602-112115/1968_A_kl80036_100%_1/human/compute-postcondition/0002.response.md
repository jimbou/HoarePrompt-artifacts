The code prints the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`, where `x` is an integer value read from `stdin`. Since `x` is read from `stdin`, its exact value is not known, but it is an integer. Therefore, `y` is also an integer, specifically one less than the value of `x`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is the integer value read from stdin)**
