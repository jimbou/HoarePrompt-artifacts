Reasoning:

The problem statement requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The provided program simply subtracts 1 from each input integer x and prints the result. This approach is based on the fact that gcd(x, x-1) is always 1, and adding x-1 to this gcd value yields x, which is the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y.

The program's logic is correct because it takes advantage of the mathematical property that gcd(x, x-1) = 1. By choosing y = x-1, the program ensures that gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x-1) = x, which is indeed the maximum possible value.

Correctness: **True**
