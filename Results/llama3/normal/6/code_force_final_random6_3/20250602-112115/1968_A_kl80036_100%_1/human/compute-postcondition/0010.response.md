Based on the precondition, we can determine the output as follows:

* `x` is an integer equal to the first integer value from the original stdin.
* `y` is an integer equal to `x - 1`.
* `i` is 2, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(y)`. Since `y` is equal to `x - 1`, the print statement will output the value of `x - 1`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is the first integer value from the original stdin)**
