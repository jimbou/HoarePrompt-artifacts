Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list max_segment with the index of the last element of arr, and the list new_segment with the index of the last element of arr, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.**

The code executes in the following way: The first line appends a new list to segments_variants, which is a copy of max_segment with the index of the last element of arr appended to it. The second line appends another new list to segments_variants, which is a copy of new_segment with the index of the last element of arr appended to it. The third line assigns a new list containing -1 to total_max_segment.
