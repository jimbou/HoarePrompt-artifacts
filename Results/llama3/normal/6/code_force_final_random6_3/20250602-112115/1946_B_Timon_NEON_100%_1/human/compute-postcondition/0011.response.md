Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the value of arr at index i, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, i is 0. The current value of new_segment is not empty. The value of arr at index i is not less than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` has been updated by adding the value of `arr[i]` to their original values. All other variables remain unchanged.
