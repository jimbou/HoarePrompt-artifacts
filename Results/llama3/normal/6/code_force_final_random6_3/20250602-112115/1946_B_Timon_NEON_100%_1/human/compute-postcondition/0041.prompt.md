Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 0. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list and the first element of max_segment is greater than the first element of new_segment. Otherwise, the first integer of max_segment is the sum of the original first integer and the value of arr at index i, and the value of arr at index i is not less than 0. If new_segment is empty, then arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing either a non-negative integer and an index or is empty, max_segment is a list containing arr[0] and 0, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 1. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants contains max_segment + [0] if max_segment[0] is greater than new_segment[0], otherwise, max_segment is equal to new_segment and segments_variants contains new_segment + [i - 1]. Otherwise, new_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[1], max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[1], and segments_variants contains at least one list. If new_segment is empty, then max_segment's first element is increased by the integer at index i of arr. If arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0, then new_segment is a list containing two elements: the integer at index i of arr and the integer i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 2. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] is negative, new_segment is an empty list and the first element of max_segment is incremented by arr[i]. If arr[i] is not negative, the first element of new_segment and the first element of max_segment are both increased by arr[2]. If new_segment is empty, then new_segment is a list containing the third element of arr and 2 if the third element of arr is non-negative, otherwise new_segment remains unchanged, and the first element of max_segment is incremented by the third element of arr.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
