The code appends a new list to the `segments_variants` list. This new list is created by concatenating the `max_segment` list with a list containing the value of `i - 1`, which is 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least two lists, the last list being `max_segment + [0]`, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 1**
