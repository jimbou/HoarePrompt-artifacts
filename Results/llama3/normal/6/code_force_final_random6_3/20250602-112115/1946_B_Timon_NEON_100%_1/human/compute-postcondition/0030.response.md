The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers that is not empty. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 2**
