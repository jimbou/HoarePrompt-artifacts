Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` also contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` also contains `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**
