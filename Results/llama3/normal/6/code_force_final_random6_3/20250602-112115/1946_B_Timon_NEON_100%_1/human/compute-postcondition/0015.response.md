The code assigns a new value to the variable `new_segment`. The new value is a list containing two elements: the current value of `arr[i]` and the index `i`. Since the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `new_segment` is a list containing a non-negative integer and an index.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing a non-negative integer and an index, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0.**
