Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers, new_segment is a list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists that must have at least 1 segment, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list max_segment with the index of the last element of arr, and the list new_segment with the index of the last element of arr, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing the first segment in segments_variants, segment is the first segment in segments_variants. If total_max_segment[0] is less than segment[0] and len(segment) is not equal to 1, then the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition.***
