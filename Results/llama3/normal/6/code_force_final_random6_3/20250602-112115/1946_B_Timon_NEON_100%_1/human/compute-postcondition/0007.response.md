Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 0. The current value of new_segment is not empty. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0. The first element of max_segment is less than or equal to the first element of new_segment.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `segments_variants` and `max_segment`. The `segments_variants` list now contains at least one list, which is a copy of `new_segment` with the index `i - 1` appended to it. The `max_segment` list now contains at least one integer, which is a copy of `new_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.
