To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `segment` and the list `segments_variants`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants`. If `segments_variants` has at least 1 segment, the loop will execute.

State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists that must have at least 1 segment, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list max_segment with the index of the last element of arr, and the list new_segment with the index of the last element of arr, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1, segment is the first segment in segments_variants**
