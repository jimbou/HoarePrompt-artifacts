Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing two elements: the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to a list containing two elements: the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the other lists (`arr`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`) still contain at least one element. The value of `max_sum` is still -1.
