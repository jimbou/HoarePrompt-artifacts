Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we have an array of integers and we can perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, we select any contiguous subarray of the array and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such operations.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. 

func_1 takes an integer 'number' as input and returns the remainder of 'number' divided by 1000000007. This function is used to perform a modulo operation on the input integer and return the result.

func_2 takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. The function iterates through the input list, identifying subarrays with maximum sums and keeping track of the maximum sum and its corresponding subarray.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls func_2 to find the maximum sum of a subarray, and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations by multiplying the maximum sum of a subarray by 2 raised to the power of k and adding the sum of the array minus the maximum sum of a subarray. The result is then passed to func_1 to perform the modulo operation.

func_3 is not used in the program.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. It correctly identifies the maximum sum of a subarray, calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations, and performs the modulo operation to handle large numbers.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
