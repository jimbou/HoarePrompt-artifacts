Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 segment, each containing a subarray of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list `max_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, and the list `new_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is a list containing the first segment in `segments_variants`, `segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is still an empty list, `max_segment` still contains the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` still contains at least one segment, each containing a subarray of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list `max_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, and the list `new_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, `max_sum` is still the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. However, `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to the first segment in `segments_variants`, which is also the current value of `segment`.
