Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is max_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, i is 0. The current value of new_segment is not empty. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0. The first element of max_segment is greater than the first element of new_segment.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of segments_variants now contains one element which is a combination of max_segment and the value of i-1. All other variables remain unchanged.
