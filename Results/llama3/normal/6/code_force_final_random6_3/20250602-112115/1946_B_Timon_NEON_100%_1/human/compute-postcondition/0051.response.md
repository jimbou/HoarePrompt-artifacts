Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is a list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 segments, each containing a subarray of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list `max_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, and the list `new_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to the second segment in `segments_variants`, which is the same as the value of `segment`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
