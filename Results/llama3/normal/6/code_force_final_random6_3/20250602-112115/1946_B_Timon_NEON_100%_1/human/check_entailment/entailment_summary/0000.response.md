Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Function func_1 takes an integer as input and returns its remainder when divided by 1000000007. This function is used to ensure that the final answer is within the required range.

Function func_2 takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. This function is used to identify the maximum sum of a subarray in the input array.

The main program iterates through the input array, calls func_2 to find the maximum sum of a subarray, and then calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations by multiplying the maximum sum by 2^k and adding the sum of the input array minus the maximum sum.

Function func_3 is not used in the main program, but it is defined as a placeholder for a potential future implementation.

Based on the execution summaries, func_1 correctly performs the modulo operation, and func_2 correctly identifies the maximum sum of a subarray. The main program correctly uses these functions to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
