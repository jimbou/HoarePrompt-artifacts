Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and is equal to new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list and also contains new_segment + [i - 1] where i is 2, max_sum is -1, i is 2**

The code modifies the `segments_variants` list by appending a new list that is a combination of `new_segment` and the value of `i - 1`, which is 1. The `max_segment` variable is updated to be equal to `new_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.
