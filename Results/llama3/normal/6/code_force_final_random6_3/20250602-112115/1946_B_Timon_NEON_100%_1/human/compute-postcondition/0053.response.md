Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is a list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list max_segment with the index of the last element of arr, and the list new_segment with the index of the last element of arr, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segment is the last segment in segments_variants.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, because the loop only executes 3 times. The state of the variables remains the same as the precondition, except for the variable total_max_segment, which is updated to be the last segment in segments_variants.
