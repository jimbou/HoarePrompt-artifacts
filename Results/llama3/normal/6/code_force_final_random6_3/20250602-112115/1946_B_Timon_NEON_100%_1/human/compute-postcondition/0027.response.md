Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 1. If arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0, then new_segment is a list containing two elements: the integer at index i of arr and the integer i. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
