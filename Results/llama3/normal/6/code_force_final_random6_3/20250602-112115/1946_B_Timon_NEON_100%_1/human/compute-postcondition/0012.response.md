Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 0. If arr[i] < 0, then new_segment is an empty list and the first element of max_segment is greater than the first element of new_segment. Otherwise, the first integer of max_segment is the sum of the original first integer and the value of arr at index i, and the value of arr at index i is not less than 0.***
