Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and its first element is incremented by the value of arr[i], segments_variants is a list containing at least two lists, the last list being max_segment + [0] if max_segment[0] is greater than new_segment[0], otherwise, max_segment is equal to new_segment and segments_variants contains new_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1 and i is 1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list of integers `arr` remains unchanged and is not empty. The list `new_segment` is now empty. The list `max_segment` still contains at least one integer, but its first element has been incremented by the value of the second element of `arr` (since `i` is 1). The list `segments_variants` still contains at least two lists. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, the last list in `segments_variants` is `max_segment` with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` contains `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1`, which is 0. The value of `max_sum` remains -1, and the value of `i` remains 1.
