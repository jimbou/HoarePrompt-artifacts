Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 0. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list and the first element of max_segment is greater than the first element of new_segment. Otherwise, the first integer of max_segment is the sum of the original first integer and the value of arr at index i, and the value of arr at index i is not less than 0. If new_segment is empty, then arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing either a non-negative integer and an index or is empty, max_segment is a list containing arr[0] and 0, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, and i is 0.***
