Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer and its first element is increased by the integer at index i of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing two elements: the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` and `segments_variants` also remain unchanged. The value of `max_sum` is still -1 and `i` is still 1. The first element of `max_segment` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i` of `arr`. If the integer at index `i` of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` contains two elements: the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer `i`.
