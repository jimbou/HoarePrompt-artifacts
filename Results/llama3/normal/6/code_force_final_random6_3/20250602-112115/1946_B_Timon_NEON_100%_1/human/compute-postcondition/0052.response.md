Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is a list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 segments, each containing a subarray of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list `max_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, and the list `new_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`. If the sum of the second segment in `segments_variants` is greater than the sum of `max_segment` and the length of the second segment in `segments_variants` is not 1, then `max_segment` is updated to the second segment in `segments_variants`.***
