Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one list and now also contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `segments_variants` has been updated to include a new list that is the result of concatenating `max_segment` with the list `[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, the new list is `max_segment + [1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
