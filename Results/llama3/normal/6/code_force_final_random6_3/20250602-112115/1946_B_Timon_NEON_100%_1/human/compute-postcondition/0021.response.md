Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and is equal to new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list and also contains new_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, i is 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the program by appending a new list to `segments_variants` and updating the value of `max_segment`. The first line appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and the list containing the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0, so the new list appended to `segments_variants` is `new_segment + [0]`. The second line updates the value of `max_segment` to be equal to `new_segment`. The values of `arr`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.
