Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 2. If arr[i] is negative, new_segment is an empty list and the first element of max_segment is incremented by arr[i]. If arr[i] is not negative, the first element of new_segment and the first element of max_segment are both increased by arr[2].***
