Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer and its first element is increased by arr[2], max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and its first element is increased by arr[2], segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 2**

The code modifies the first elements of `new_segment` and `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[2]` to them. The value of `arr[2]` is used directly for these calculations. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
