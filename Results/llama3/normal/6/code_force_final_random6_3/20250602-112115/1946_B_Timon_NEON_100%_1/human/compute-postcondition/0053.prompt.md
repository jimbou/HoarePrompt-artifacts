Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list max_segment with the index of the last element of arr, and the list new_segment with the index of the last element of arr, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *arr is a list of integers, new_segment is a list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists that must have at least 1 segment, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list max_segment with the index of the last element of arr, and the list new_segment with the index of the last element of arr, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing the first segment in segments_variants, segment is the first segment in segments_variants. If total_max_segment[0] is less than segment[0] and len(segment) is not equal to 1, then the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is a list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 segments, each containing a subarray of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list `max_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, and the list `new_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and `len(segment)` is not equal to 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the second segment in `segments_variants` and `segment` is updated to be the second segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is a list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 segments, each containing a subarray of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, and the list `max_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, and the list `new_segment` with the index of the last element of `arr`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `segment` is the second segment in `segments_variants`. If the sum of the second segment in `segments_variants` is greater than the sum of `max_segment` and the length of the second segment in `segments_variants` is not 1, then `max_segment` is updated to the second segment in `segments_variants`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
