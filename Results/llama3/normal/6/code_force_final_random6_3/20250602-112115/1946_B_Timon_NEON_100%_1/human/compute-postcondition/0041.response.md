Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of lists, each containing a subarray of arr with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of this subarray, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed the entire list of integers, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The `new_segment` list is empty, indicating that the loop has finished processing the list. The `max_segment` list contains the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray. The `segments_variants` list contains all the subarrays of `arr` with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of each subarray. The `max_sum` variable contains the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`.
