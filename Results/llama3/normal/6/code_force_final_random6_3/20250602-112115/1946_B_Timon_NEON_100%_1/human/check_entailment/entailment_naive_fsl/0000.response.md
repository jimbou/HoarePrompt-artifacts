Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The problem description requires the program to perform exactly k operations on the array, where in one operation, a contiguous subarray of the array (possibly empty) is selected and its sum is inserted anywhere in the array. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the required operations. The program also does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the array is negative.

For example, if the input is `n = 3, k = 2, a = [-1, -2, -3]`, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after 2 operations. The correct answer is `999999996`, but the program will not produce this result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
