Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer. If max_segment[0] is greater than new_segment[0], then segments_variants is a list containing at least two lists, the last list being max_segment + [0]. Otherwise, max_segment is equal to new_segment and segments_variants is a list containing at least one list and also contains new_segment + [i - 1]. In both cases, max_sum is -1 and i is 1.***
