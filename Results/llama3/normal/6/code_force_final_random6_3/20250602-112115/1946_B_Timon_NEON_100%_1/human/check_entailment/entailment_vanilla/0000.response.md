Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program provided consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Func_1 is a simple function that returns the remainder of a number modulo 1000000007.

Func_2 appears to be an attempt to find the maximum sum of a subarray within the given array. It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum of positive numbers and a separate sum of all numbers. When it encounters a negative number, it checks if the current sum of positive numbers is greater than the overall sum and updates the maximum sum accordingly. However, this function has several issues:

1.  It does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum is a single negative number.
2.  It does not consider the case where the maximum sum is the sum of the entire array.
3.  It does not account for the k operations, which allow for the insertion of the sum of any subarray anywhere in the array.

Func_3 is incomplete and does not provide any meaningful functionality.

Given the issues with func_2 and the incompleteness of func_3, the program is not correct. It does not accurately solve the problem and does not account for all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
