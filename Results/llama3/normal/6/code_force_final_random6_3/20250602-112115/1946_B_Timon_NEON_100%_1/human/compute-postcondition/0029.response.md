Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing at least one list, max_sum is -1, i is 1. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants contains max_segment + [0] if max_segment[0] is greater than new_segment[0], otherwise, max_segment is equal to new_segment and segments_variants contains new_segment + [i - 1]. Otherwise, new_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[1], max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[1], and segments_variants contains at least one list. If new_segment is empty, then max_segment's first element is increased by the integer at index i of arr. If arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0, then new_segment is a list containing two elements: the integer at index i of arr and the integer i.***
