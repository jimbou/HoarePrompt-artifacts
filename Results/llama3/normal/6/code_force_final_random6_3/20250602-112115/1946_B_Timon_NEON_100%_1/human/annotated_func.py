#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. The function iterates through the input list, identifying subarrays with maximum sums and keeping track of the maximum sum and its corresponding subarray. It handles cases where the input list contains both positive and negative numbers, and it returns the maximum sum and the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer and quantity is a non-negative integer
    answer = 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function initializes a variable "answer" to 0.
