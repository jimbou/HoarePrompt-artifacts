Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing either a non-negative integer and an index or is empty, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (0) and the value of `arr[i]`, which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
