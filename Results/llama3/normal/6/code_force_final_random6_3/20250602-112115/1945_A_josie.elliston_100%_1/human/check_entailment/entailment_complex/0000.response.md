Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, as input. It checks if the current value of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is true, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers, `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, as input. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and checks the return value. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1`.

The program's logic is correct. It first checks if it's possible to accommodate the extroverts and universals together in tents of three people each. If it's not possible (i.e., `func_1` returns `None`), the program returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts) and adds it to the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
