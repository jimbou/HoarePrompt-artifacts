Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

2. Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly calls Function 1 with the number of extroverts and universals as arguments. If Function 1 returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of Function 1, which is the total number of tents needed to accommodate all participants.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, Function 1 returns the correct number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
* If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, but there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots, Function 1 returns the correct number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
* If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, Function 1 returns `None`, and Function 2 returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
