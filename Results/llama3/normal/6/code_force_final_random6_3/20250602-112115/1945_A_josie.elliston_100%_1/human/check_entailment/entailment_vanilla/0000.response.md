Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the total minimum number of tents needed. It first calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals and stores the result in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and `ret`, which represents the total minimum number of tents needed.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly checks for the impossibility of accommodating the extroverts and universals and returns -1 in such cases. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for the introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Correctness: **True**
