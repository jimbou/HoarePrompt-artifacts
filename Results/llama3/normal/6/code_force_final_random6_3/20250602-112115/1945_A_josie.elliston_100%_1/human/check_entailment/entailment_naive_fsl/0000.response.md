Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

The `func_1` function correctly handles the case where there are extroverts and universals. It checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and if so, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can be accommodated in a tent. If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

The `func_2` function correctly adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`, since each introvert needs a separate tent.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where there are no extroverts, no universals, or no introverts. It also correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, in which case the universals can be accommodated in the same tents as the extroverts.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
