Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Function func_1 takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. It checks if the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If this condition is met, the function returns None, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the wishes. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

Function func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input. It calls func_1 with extroverts and universals as arguments and checks the return value. If func_1 returns None, func_2 returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the result of func_1, which represents the total minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants.

The program iterates over the test cases, reads the input values for introverts, extroverts, and universals, and calls func_2 with these values. The output of func_2 is printed for each test case.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
