Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `q-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the last line of stdin, stdin is empty. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not greater than `c`, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `q`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values of the last line of input. The loop will have printed 'STAIR' if the last line of input was in ascending order, 'PEAK' if the last line of input was in the shape of a peak, and 'NONE' otherwise. The input stream will be empty after the loop has finished executing.
