Output: **`q` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains q-4 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not greater than `c`, 'NONE' is printed. and 'PEAK' is printed**
