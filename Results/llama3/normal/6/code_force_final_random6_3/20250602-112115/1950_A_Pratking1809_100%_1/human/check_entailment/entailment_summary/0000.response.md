Reasoning:

The given program is designed to classify a set of three digits as either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on their relative values. The program correctly implements the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c). It also handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak, printing 'NONE' in such cases.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly processes the input as described in the problem statement. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
