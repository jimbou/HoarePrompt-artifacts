Based on the precondition, the code will print 'NONE'. The value of 'NONE' is a string literal that is printed when the conditions for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK' are not met. In this case, the print statement is executed unconditionally, without any checks on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output will always be 'NONE', regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
