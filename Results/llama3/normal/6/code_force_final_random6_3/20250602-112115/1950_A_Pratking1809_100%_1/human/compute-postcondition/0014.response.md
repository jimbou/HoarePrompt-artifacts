Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains q-1 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
