Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains q-1 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `q` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the three digits from the first line of the input, which are integers between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `q-1` lines, as the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
