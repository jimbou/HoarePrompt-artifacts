Functionality: **This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains three digits. It then classifies each set of digits as either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on their relative values, and prints out the corresponding classification. The function processes a number of lines specified by the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
