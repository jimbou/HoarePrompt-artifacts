The code `q = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The first input is assigned to q. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since one input is accepted, stdin now contains t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).

Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains q lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
