The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `q` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, because the loop will start from 0.

State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, stdin contains q lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
