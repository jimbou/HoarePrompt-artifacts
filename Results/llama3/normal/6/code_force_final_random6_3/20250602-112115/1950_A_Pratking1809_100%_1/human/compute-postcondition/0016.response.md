Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains q-3 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the first line of input from stdin, which contains three digits between 0 and 9. The remaining input lines in stdin are reduced by one. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' remain the same based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
