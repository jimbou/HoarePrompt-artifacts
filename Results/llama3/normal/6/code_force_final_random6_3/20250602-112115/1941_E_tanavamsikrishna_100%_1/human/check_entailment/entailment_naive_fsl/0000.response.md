Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the row is modified in-place, and the `min_heap` is not correctly updated.

In the `func_1` function, the line `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` modifies the `row` list in-place, which affects the subsequent iterations of the loop. This is not intended by the problem description, which asks for the minimum total cost of supports installation.

Moreover, the `min_heap` is not correctly updated. The line `heappush(min_heap, e)` pushes the same element `e` back into the heap, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the `func_1` function should be modified to create a new list to store the updated costs, and the `min_heap` should be updated correctly.

Here is an example of an input that the program does not work correctly for:

```
1 8 1 1
0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0
```

The program outputs `15`, but the correct output should be `14`.
