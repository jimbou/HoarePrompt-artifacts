To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `costs` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The length of the `costs` list is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that it has a length of at least `k + 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the length of `costs` is at least 3. Therefore, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute again.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `rows`, `costs`, `total_costs`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. `costs` is a list of integers with a length of at least `k + 2`, where each integer is the cost of a row. `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first `k` rows and the sum of the costs of the next `k` rows. `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty.**
