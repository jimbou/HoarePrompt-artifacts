Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance `d` between supports as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row by using a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports for the previous `d` cells. The function returns the minimum cost of installing supports for the entire row.

`func_2` reads the input data, which includes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d` between supports. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. Finally, it calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows by summing the minimum costs of installing supports for each row and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It uses a min-heap to efficiently keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports for the previous `d` cells, which reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the `func_1` function, the line `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. It should be `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 2` because the cost of installing a support is `a_{i,j} + 1`, not `a_{i,j} + 2`. But the `+ 1` is already added in the line `row[i] = row[i] + 2`, so it should be `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

Correctness: **False**
