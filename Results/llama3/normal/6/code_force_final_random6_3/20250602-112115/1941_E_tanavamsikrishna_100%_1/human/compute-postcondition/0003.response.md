The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `costs`. If `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `len(costs)` is at least `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `len(costs)` must be at least `k + 2`.
State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers with a length of at least k + 2, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first k rows. i is 1, stdin is empty.**
