The code appends the sum of the costs of k rows to the total_costs list. The sum of the costs is calculated from the ith index to the (i + k)th index in the costs list. Since i is 0, the sum is calculated from the 0th index to the kth index.

The value of i is not changed, so it remains 0. The values of n, m, k, and d are not affected, so they remain positive integers. The value of rows is not affected, so it remains a 2D list of non-negative integers. The value of costs is not affected, so it remains a list of integers with a length of at least k + 1.

The total_costs list is updated by appending the sum of the costs of k rows. The sum is calculated from the 0th index to the kth index in the costs list.

Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers with a length of at least k + 1, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first k rows. i is 0, stdin is empty.**
