To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state right before the loop, we know:

- `min_heap` is a valid min-heap containing tuples with elements from `row` and their indices.
- `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of -3 or less.
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2.
- `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`.
- `i` is `d + 1`.
- `len(row)` is at least 4.
- `row[i - 1]` is increased by the value of `e[0]` plus 1.
- `min_heap` contains the tuple (`row[i - 1]`, `i - 1`) and the tuple `e`, and also contains the tuple (`e[0]` + `row[i - 1]` + 1, `i - 1`).

The loop condition depends on the index of the popped element from `min_heap` being less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Since `i` is `d + 1`, `i - (d + 2)` simplifies to `-1`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the top element of `min_heap` (which is the smallest due to the min-heap property) must have an index less than or equal to `-1`. Given that `min_heap` contains an element with an index of -3 or less, this condition is already satisfied.

However, to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that the smallest index in `min_heap` is indeed less than or equal to `-1`. Since `min_heap` already contains elements with indices of -3 or less, no additional adjustments are necessary to the states of objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of -3 or less, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`, `len(row)` is at least 4, `row[i - 1]` is increased by the value of `e[0]` plus 1, `min_heap` contains the tuple (`row[i - 1]`, `i - 1`) and the tuple `e`, and `min_heap` also contains the tuple (`e[0]` + `row[i - 1]` + 1, `i - 1`).**
