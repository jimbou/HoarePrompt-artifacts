Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is an empty list. stdin is empty.**

The code first reads four positive integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, k, and d, respectively. Then, it reads n rows of non-negative integers from stdin and stores them in the 2D list rows. After that, it calculates the cost of each row using the function func_1 and stores the results in the list costs. Finally, it initializes an empty list total_costs. The values of n, m, k, and d are updated with the input values, and the rows, costs, and total_costs lists are created. Stdin is emptied after reading the input values and rows.
