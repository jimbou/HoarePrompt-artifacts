Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers with a length of at least k + 2, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first k rows and the sum of the costs of the next k rows. i is 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, d, rows, and costs remain unchanged. The value of i is still 1. The stdin is still empty. The only change is in the total_costs list, which now contains the sum of the costs of the first k rows and the sum of the costs of the next k rows.
