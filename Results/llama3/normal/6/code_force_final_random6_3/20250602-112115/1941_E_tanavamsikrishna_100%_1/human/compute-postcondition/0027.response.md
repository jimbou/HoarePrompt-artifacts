Output State: **min_heap is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row and its corresponding index, min_heap is a valid min-heap, min_heap must contain an element with an index of -3 or less, row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, d is at least 3 and less than len(row), i is d, len(row) is at least 4, row[i] is increased by the value of e[0] plus 1, min_heap contains the tuple (row[i], i) and the tuple e, and min_heap also contains the tuple (e[0] + row[i] + 1, i).**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The min_heap is still a valid min-heap containing tuples of elements from the row list along with their indices. The row list remains unchanged except for the element at index i, which has been incremented by the value of e[0] plus 1. The min_heap now contains three tuples: (row[i], i), e, and (e[0] + row[i] + 1, i). The values of d and len(row) remain the same.
