The code appends the sum of the costs of the next k rows to the total_costs list. The value of i is 2, so the sum of the costs of the next k rows is the sum of the costs of the rows from index 2 to index 2 + k - 1. The value of k is a positive integer, so the sum of the costs of the next k rows is the sum of the costs of k rows.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. `costs` is a list of integers with a length of at least `k + 2`, where each integer is the cost of a row. `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first `k` rows, the sum of the costs of the next `k` rows, and the sum of the costs of the next `k` rows. `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty.**
