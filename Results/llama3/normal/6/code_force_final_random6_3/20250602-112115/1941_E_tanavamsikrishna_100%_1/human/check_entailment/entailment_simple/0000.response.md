Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and heap data structure to efficiently calculate the minimum cost.

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, while `func_2` calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for all consecutive sequences of k rows.

In `func_1`, the program first initializes the first element of the row to 1 and increases the rest of the elements by 2. It then creates a min-heap containing the first d elements of the row and their corresponding indices. The program then iterates through the rest of the row, updating the min-heap and the row elements accordingly. Finally, it returns the last element of the row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

In `func_2`, the program reads the input data, including the number of rows, columns, bridges, and the maximum distance between supports. It then creates a 2D list of non-negative integers representing the river, where each inner list represents a row and each integer represents the depth of a cell. The program then calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores the results in a list. It then calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for all consecutive sequences of k rows by summing the costs of each sequence and storing the results in another list. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

The program's logic and implementation are correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
