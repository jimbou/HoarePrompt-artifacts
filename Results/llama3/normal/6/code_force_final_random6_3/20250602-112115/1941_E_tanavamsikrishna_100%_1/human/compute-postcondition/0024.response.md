To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `e` (the popped element from `min_heap`) and `i`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if the index of the popped element `e[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `e[1]` is less than or equal to `d - 3` (since the first popped element must have an index less than or equal to `d - 3`), and `i` is `d + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `e` so that its index `e[1]` is still less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Since `i` is `d + 1`, we can rewrite the condition as `e[1]` being less than or equal to `-1`.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `min_heap` still contains an element with an index of `-3` or less, so that the next popped element can satisfy the condition.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of -3 or less, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row) - 2`, `i` is `d + 1`, `len(row)` is at least 4, `row[i]` is increased by the value of `e[0]` plus 1, `min_heap` contains the tuple `(row[i], i)`, `e` is a tuple where `e[1]` is less than or equal to -1, and no changes have been made to the variables.**
