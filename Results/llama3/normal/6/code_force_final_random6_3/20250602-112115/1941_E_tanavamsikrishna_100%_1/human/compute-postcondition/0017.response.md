Output State: `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of `-3` or less after the previous pop operation, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d - 1`, `len(row)` is at least 2.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. This is because the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is true, and after 3 iterations, the smallest possible index in `min_heap` is `-3` or less, which means that the condition will no longer be true and the loop will terminate. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
