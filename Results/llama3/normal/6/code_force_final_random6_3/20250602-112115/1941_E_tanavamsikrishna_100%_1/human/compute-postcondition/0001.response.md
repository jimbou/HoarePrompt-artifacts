To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. For the loop to execute, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1, meaning `len(costs)` must be at least `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `len(costs)` must be at least 1 more than `k`.

State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers with a length of at least k + 1, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is an empty list. stdin is empty, i is 0**
