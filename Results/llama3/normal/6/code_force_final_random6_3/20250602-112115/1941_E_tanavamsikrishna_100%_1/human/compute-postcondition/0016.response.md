Output State: `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` contains an element with an index of `-3` or less after the previous pop operation, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d - 1`, `len(row)` is at least 2.

The loop will continue to execute until the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is no longer true. After the third iteration, the loop will stop because the index of the popped element `e[1]` will be greater than `i - (d + 2)`. The final state of the variables will be the same as the state after the third iteration, with the additional condition that the loop has finished executing.
