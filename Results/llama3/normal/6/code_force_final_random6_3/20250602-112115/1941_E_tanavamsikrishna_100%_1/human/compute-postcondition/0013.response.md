Output State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` contains an element with an index of `-3` or less, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d - 1`, `len(row)` is at least 2**

The code has no impact on the program as it is a `pass` statement, which does nothing. Therefore, all the variables and their values remain the same.
