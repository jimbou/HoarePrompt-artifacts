Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of all consecutive sequences of k rows. i is len(costs) - (k - 1), stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate over the list of costs, calculating the sum of the costs of all consecutive sequences of k rows. The total costs will be stored in the total_costs list. The loop will continue until it has processed all possible sequences of k rows in the costs list. At the end of the loop, the variable i will be equal to the number of sequences of k rows that were processed. The other variables, n, m, k, d, rows, and stdin, will remain unchanged.
