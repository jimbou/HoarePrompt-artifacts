Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The first function, func_1, calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, and the second function, func_2, calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for all consecutive sequences of k rows.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of rows is less than k, and when the maximum distance between supports is greater than or equal to the number of columns.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum total cost by considering all possible sequences of k rows and selecting the one with the minimum total cost.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
