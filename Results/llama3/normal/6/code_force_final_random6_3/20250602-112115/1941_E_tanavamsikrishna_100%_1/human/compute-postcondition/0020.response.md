To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

The variables involved in the loop head are `e` (which is a tuple popped from `min_heap`), `i`, and `d`. Since `e` is a result of `heappop(min_heap)`, we can't directly adjust its state. However, we can adjust the state of `min_heap` to ensure that the first popped element satisfies the condition.

The condition requires that the index of the popped element (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Since `i` is equal to `d`, we can simplify the condition to `e[1] <= d - 2`.

Given that `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of -3 or less, we can adjust the state of `min_heap` to ensure that the first popped element has an index that satisfies the condition.

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row and its corresponding index, min_heap is a valid min-heap, min_heap must contain an element with an index of -3 or less and the first popped element must have an index less than or equal to d - 2, row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, d is at least 3 and less than len(row), i is d, len(row) is at least 4, row[i] is increased by the value of e[0] plus 1, min_heap contains the tuple (row[i], i) and the tuple e**
