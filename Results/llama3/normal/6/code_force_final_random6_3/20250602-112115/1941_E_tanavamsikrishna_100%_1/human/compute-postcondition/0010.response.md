Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the minimum sum of the costs of all consecutive sequences of k rows in a river, where the cost of each row is determined by the maximum distance between supports and the depth of each cell. It takes as input the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance between supports, as well as the depth of each cell in the river. The function returns the minimum total cost of all consecutive sequences of k rows.**
