Output State: **min_heap is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row and its corresponding index, min_heap is a valid min-heap, min_heap must contain an element with an index of -3 or less after the previous pop operation, row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, d is at least 3 and less than len(row), i is d - 1, len(row) is at least 2, row[i] is increased by the value of e[0] plus 1, min_heap contains the tuple (row[i], i) and the tuple e.**

In this output state, the value of `row[i]` has been increased by the value of `e[0]` plus 1, and the tuple `(row[i], i)` and the tuple `e` have been added to `min_heap`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The loop will terminate after 3 iterations because the smallest possible index in `min_heap` is `-3` or less, which means that the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` will no longer be true.
