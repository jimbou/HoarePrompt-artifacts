Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is an empty list. stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers with a length of at least k + 1, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first k rows. i is 0, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers with a length of at least k + 2, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first k rows and the sum of the costs of the next k rows. i is 1, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. `costs` is a list of integers with a length of at least `k + 2`, where each integer is the cost of a row. `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the costs of the first `k` rows, the sum of the costs of the next `k` rows, and the sum of the costs of the next `k` rows. `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
