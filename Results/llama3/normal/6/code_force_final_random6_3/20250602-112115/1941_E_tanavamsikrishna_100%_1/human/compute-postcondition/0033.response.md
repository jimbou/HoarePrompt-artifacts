To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `e` and `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a tuple popped from `min_heap`, and `i` is at least `d + 2`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `e` and `i` as follows:

* `e` must be a tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Since `min_heap` is a valid min-heap and contains an element with an index of -3 or less, we can ensure that `e` will be a tuple with a small index.
* `i` must be greater than `d + 2` to ensure that the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is true.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of -3 or less, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is greater than `d + 2`, `len(row)` is at least 4, `row[i - 1]` is increased by the value of `e[0]` plus 1, `min_heap` contains the tuple (`row[i - 1]`, `i - 1`) and the tuple `e`, and `min_heap` also contains the tuple (`e[0]` + `row[i - 1]` + 1, `i - 1`)**
