The code prints the minimum cost of all consecutive sequences of k rows.
Since the exact costs list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the minimum cost. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum cost.
Output: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the cost of a row. total_costs is a list containing the sum of the costs of all consecutive sequences of k rows. i is len(costs) - (k - 1), stdin is empty, and the minimum cost of all consecutive sequences of k rows is printed, which is min(total_costs)**
