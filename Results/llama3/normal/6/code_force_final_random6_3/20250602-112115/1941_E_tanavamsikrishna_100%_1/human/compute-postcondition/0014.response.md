To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. This condition depends on the state of `min_heap`, `i`, and `d`.

1. **`min_heap`**: It is already a valid min-heap and contains an element with an index of `-3` or less. This state is favorable for the loop to continue as long as the popped element's index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. No adjustment is needed here based on the given information, but we need to ensure that after popping an element, `min_heap` still contains elements that could satisfy the condition in the next iteration.

2. **`i` and `d`**: The relationship between `i` and `d` is given as `i` is `d - 1`. The condition in the loop involves `i - (d + 2)`, which simplifies to `-3` given the relationship between `i` and `d`. This means the loop continues as long as the index of the popped element from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `-3`.

Given these considerations, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that after the previous iteration, `min_heap` still contains an element that can satisfy the condition in the next iteration. Since `min_heap` already contains an element with an index of `-3` or less and is a valid min-heap, the condition can be satisfied in the next iteration without needing to adjust `i` or `d`, as their relationship is fixed and does not impact the ability of the loop to continue based on the `min_heap`'s state.

However, to strictly adhere to the task's requirement for modifying the state so that the next iteration can proceed, we acknowledge that `min_heap` must still contain elements that can satisfy the condition after the previous iteration. Thus, the focus is on ensuring `min_heap` has the appropriate elements, but given it's already a min-heap with elements that could satisfy the condition, the emphasis is on the existence of such elements rather than altering `i` or `d`.

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of `-3` or less after the previous pop operation, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d - 1`, `len(row)` is at least 2**
