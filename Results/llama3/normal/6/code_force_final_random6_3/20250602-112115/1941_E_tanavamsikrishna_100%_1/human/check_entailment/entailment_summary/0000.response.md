Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. 

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer as input, modifies the list by incrementing the first element to 1, the next 'd' elements by 2, and the remaining elements by the value of the smallest element in the previous 'd' elements plus 1, and returns the last element of the modified list. This function correctly calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row of the river.

Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates and prints the minimum sum of the costs of all consecutive sequences of k rows in a river, where the cost of each row is determined by the maximum distance between supports and the depth of each cell. It takes as input the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance between supports, as well as the depth of each cell in the river. The function returns the minimum total cost of all consecutive sequences of k rows.

The main function iterates over the test cases, calls `func_2` for each test case, and prints the result. 

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions, so the correctness is **True**.
