According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `e` and `i` and `d`. If `e[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e[1]` is `i - 1` and `i` is `d + 1`. `i` being `d + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least `d + 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its corresponding index, `min_heap` is a valid min-heap, `min_heap` must contain an element with an index of -3 or less, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are increased by 2, `d` is at least 3 and less than `len(row)`, `i` is at least `d + 2`, `len(row)` is at least 4, `row[i - 1]` is increased by the value of `e[0]` plus 1, `min_heap` contains the tuple (`row[i - 1]`, `i - 1`) and the tuple `e`, and `min_heap` also contains the tuple (`e[0]` + `row[i - 1]` + 1, `i - 1`)**
