The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains an additional element which is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains an additional element which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 2, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x - remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15 + 1. `screen_require_for_y` is now an integer equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise it is `((y+1)/2) + 1` if `y` is odd.**
