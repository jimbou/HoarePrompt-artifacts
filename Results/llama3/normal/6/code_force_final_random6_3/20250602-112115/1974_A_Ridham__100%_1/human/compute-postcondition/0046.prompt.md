Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, result is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: pairs of integers x and y
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15 + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains an additional element which is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains an additional element which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x - remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15 + 1. `screen_require_for_y` is now an integer equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise it is `((y+1)/2) + 1` if `y` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. `stdin` contains t-5 inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 2, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y` which is equal to 15 * (`y // 2` if `y` is even, `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd) - 4y. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains an additional element which is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x` - (15 * (`y // 2` if `y` is even, `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd) - 4y). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` // 15 which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * (`y // 2` if `y` is even, `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd) - 4y)) // 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` // 15 + 1 which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * (`y // 2` if `y` is even, `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd) - 4y)) // 15 + 1. `result` contains an additional element which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
