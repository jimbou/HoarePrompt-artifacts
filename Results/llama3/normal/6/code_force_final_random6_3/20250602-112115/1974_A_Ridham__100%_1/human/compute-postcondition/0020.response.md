The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15 + 1.**
