Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an even integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same as the first input from stdin and is greater than 0. The `result` list is still empty. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `x` is still an integer. The value of `y` is still an even integer. The value of `space_x` is still equal to x. The value of `space_y` is still equal to 4y. The value of `total_space` is still equal to 5x + 4y. A new variable `screen_require_for_y` is introduced and is equal to y // 2.
