Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, _ is 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is an integer equal to x, space_y is an integer equal to 4y, total_space is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y // 2. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to (y+1)/2.***
