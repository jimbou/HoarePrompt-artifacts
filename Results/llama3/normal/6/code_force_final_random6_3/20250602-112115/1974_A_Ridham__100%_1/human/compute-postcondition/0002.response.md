Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, _ is 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is an integer equal to x, space_y is an integer equal to 4y, total_space is an integer equal to 5x + 4y**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `result`, and `_` remain unchanged. The code consumes one pair of integers from stdin, leaving `t-1` pairs remaining. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the consumed pair of integers. The variables `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` are calculated based on the values of `x` and `y`, with `space_x` being equal to `x`, `space_y` being equal to `4y`, and `total_space` being equal to `5x + 4y`.
