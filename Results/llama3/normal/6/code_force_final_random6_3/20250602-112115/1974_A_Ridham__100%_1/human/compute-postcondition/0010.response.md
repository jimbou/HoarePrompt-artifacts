Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`. The current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`, stdin contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `result` has been updated to include the value of `screen_require_for_y`, which is either `y // 2` if `y` is even or `(y+1)/2` if `y` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.
