Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to 0, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` for each input pair of integers `x` and `y`, stdin contains 0 inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input pairs of integers `x` and `y` from stdin, and the result list contains the required number of screens for each pair. The loop has iterated `n` times, and the variables `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen` have been updated accordingly for each iteration. The loop has finished executing, and the final state of the variables is as described above.
