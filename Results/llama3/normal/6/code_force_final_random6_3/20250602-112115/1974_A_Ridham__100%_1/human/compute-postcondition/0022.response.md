Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x - remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15 + 1. `screen_require_for_y` is now an integer equal to `y // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be equal to `y // 2`, which is the integer division of `y` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and relationships between variables are still valid.
