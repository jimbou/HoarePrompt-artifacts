Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `result`, stdin, `_`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `screen_require_for_y` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `remaining_cells` is introduced, which is calculated as 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`. The value of `remaining_cells` depends on whether `y` is even or odd, and it is calculated accordingly.
