Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x - remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15` which is equal to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra_screen` has been updated to be the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, which is equivalent to `(space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)) // 15`. The other variables remain unchanged.
