Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `(y+1)/2`. `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`. `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells` which is equal to `space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`). `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` which is equal to (`space_x` - (15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`)) // 15 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `extra_screen` which is calculated based on the values of `extra_space`, `space_x`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `space_y`. The value of `extra_screen` is the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, plus 1.
