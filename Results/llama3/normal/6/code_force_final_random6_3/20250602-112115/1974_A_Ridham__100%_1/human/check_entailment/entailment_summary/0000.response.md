Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required to display a given number of cells, considering the available space on each screen and the number of cells that can fit in the remaining space. The program takes into account the size of the icons (1x1 and 2x2) and the number of icons of each size.

The program first calculates the total space required for the icons, then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. It then checks if the remaining space on those screens is enough to accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens required to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases, including when the number of 2x2 icons is odd, which requires an additional screen. The program also handles the case when there are no 2x2 icons, in which case it only needs to calculate the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons.

The execution summary confirms that the program calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required, which matches the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
