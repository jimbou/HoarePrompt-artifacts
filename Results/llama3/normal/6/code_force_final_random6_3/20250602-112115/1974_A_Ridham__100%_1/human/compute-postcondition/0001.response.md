The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0**
