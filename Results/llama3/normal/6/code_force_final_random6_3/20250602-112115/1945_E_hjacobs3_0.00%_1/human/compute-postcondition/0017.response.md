Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are updated such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `mid` is an integer less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.***
