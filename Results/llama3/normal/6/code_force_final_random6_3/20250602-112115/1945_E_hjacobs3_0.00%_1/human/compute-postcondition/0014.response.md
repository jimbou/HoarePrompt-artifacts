The value of `mid` is assigned the value of `(l + r) // 2`. The value of `l` is less than or equal to `r`. The value of `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `mid` is less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`. The value of `mid` is an integer.

Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `mid` is an integer less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`**
