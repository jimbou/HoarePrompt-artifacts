Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is an integer less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still valid, with `r` being greater than or equal to `l`. The value of `mid` is still an integer less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`.
