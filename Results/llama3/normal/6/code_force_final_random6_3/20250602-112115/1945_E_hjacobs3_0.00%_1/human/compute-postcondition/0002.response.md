Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is the length of array, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is the integer part of (n - 1) / 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The array remains a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. The value of `find` is still an integer from 1 to n. The length of the array is still `n`. The left boundary `l` is still 0, and the right boundary `r` is still `n - 1`. A new variable `mid` is introduced, which is the integer part of the average of `n - 1` and 0, i.e., the integer part of `(n - 1) / 2`.
