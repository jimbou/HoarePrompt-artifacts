#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, and n is the length of array.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two values: the first value is a string representation of an integer that is either `l + 1` or `r + 1`, where `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, and the second value is a string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, where `find` is an integer from 1 to `n` and `n` is the length of `array`.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`. `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`, and 0 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches for an integer in a list of distinct integers and returns the index of the searched integer and the index of the first integer greater than or equal to the searched integer if they are not the same, otherwise prints 0.
