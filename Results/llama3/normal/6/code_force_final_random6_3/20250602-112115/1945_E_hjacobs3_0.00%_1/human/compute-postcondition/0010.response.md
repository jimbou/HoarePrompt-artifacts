Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, `r` is `mid - 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The array remains unchanged, the value to be found is still between 1 and n, the length of the array is still n, the left pointer is still less than or equal to the right pointer, the mid value is still the average of the left and right pointers, and the right pointer has been updated to be one less than the mid value.
