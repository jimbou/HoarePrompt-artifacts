Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`. After the if-else block, `l` and `r` are updated such that `array[mid]` is either greater than or equal to `find` or less than `find`, and `mid` is the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2. Specifically, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 - 1. Otherwise, `l` is updated to the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 + 1.***
