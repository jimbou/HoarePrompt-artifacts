Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**.

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, which is `(l + r) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `array` still being a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` being an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` being the length of `array`, and `l` being less than or equal to `r`.
