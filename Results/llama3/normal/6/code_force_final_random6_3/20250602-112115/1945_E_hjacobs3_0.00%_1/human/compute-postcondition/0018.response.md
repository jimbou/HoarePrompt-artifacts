Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `array` remains unchanged, the value of `find` remains unchanged, and the length of `array` remains unchanged. The loop terminates when `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`, indicating that the search space has been fully explored.
