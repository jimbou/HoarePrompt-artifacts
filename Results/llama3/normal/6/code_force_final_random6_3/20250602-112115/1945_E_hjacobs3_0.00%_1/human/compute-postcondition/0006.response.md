Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is the length of array, `l` is the integer part of (n - 1) / 2 + 1, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is the integer part of (n - 1) / 2, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, which is equivalent to the integer part of (n - 1) / 2 + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The array still contains distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the value of `find` is still an integer from 1 to n. The length of the array, `n`, remains the same, and the value of `r` is still n - 1. The value of `mid` is still the integer part of (n - 1) / 2, and `array[mid]` is still less than `find`.
