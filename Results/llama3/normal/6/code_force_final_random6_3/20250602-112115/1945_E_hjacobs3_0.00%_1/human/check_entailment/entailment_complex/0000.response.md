Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the target number `x` in the permutation `p`. The program first checks if the target number is at the correct position after the binary search. If not, it swaps the target number with the number at the correct position and prints the indices of the swapped numbers. If the target number is already at the correct position, it simply prints 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the target number is not at the correct position after the binary search. It swaps the target number with the number at the correct position, which ensures that the binary search algorithm will find the target number in the next iteration.

The program also correctly handles the case where the target number is already at the correct position after the binary search. In this case, it simply prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
