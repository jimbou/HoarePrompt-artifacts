According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are updated such that `array[mid]` is either greater than or equal to `find` or less than `find`, and `mid` is the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2. Specifically, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 - 1. Otherwise, `l` is updated to the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 + 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**
