The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are updated based on the comparison of `array[mid]` and `find`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `l` and `r` such that `l` is still less than or equal to `r`.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
