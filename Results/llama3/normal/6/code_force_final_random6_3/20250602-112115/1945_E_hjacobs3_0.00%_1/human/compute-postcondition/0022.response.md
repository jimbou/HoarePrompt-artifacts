Output State: **The program returns a list containing two values: the first value is a string representation of an integer that is either `l + 1` or `r + 1`, where `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, and the second value is a string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, where `find` is an integer from 1 to `n` and `n` is the length of `array`.**
