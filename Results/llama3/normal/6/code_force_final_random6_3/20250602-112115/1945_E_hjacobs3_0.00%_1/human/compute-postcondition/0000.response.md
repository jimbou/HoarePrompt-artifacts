Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the length of the array to the variable n. Since the array contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the length of the array is indeed n. The second line assigns 0 to the variable l and n - 1 to the variable r. These assignments do not affect the values of array, find, or n. 

After the execution of the code snippet, the values of array, find, and n remain unchanged. The variables l and r are assigned new values, 0 and n - 1, respectively.
