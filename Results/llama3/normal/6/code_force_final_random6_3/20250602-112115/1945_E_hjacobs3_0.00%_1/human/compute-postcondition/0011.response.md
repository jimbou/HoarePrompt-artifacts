Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be `mid + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still maintained, with `r` being greater than or equal to `l`. The value of `mid` is still the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, but now `l` has a new value.
