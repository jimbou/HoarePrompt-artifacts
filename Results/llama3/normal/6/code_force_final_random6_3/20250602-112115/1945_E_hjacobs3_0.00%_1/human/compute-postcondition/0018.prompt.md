Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    if array[mid] >= find:
        r = mid - 1
    else:
        l = mid + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`. After the if-else block, `l` and `r` are updated such that `array[mid]` is either greater than or equal to `find` or less than `find`, and `mid` is the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2. Specifically, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 - 1. Otherwise, `l` is updated to the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are updated such that if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `r` is set to `mid - 1`, otherwise `l` is set to `mid + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are updated such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `mid` is an integer less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
