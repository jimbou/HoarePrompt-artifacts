Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `mid` is an integer less than or equal to `r` and greater than or equal to `l`, `r` is equal to `mid - 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be one less than the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still valid, but the exact value of `r` is now dependent on the value of `mid`.
