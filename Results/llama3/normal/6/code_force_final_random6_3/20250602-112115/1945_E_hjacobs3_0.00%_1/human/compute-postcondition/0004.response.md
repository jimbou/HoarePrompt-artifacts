Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2 - 1, `mid` is the integer part of (`n` - 1) / 2. The current value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `array` remains unchanged, the value of `find` remains unchanged, the length of `array` remains `n`, the left boundary `l` remains 0, the right boundary `r` is updated to be one less than the middle index `mid`, and the middle index `mid` remains the same. The relationship between `array[mid]` and `find` remains the same, with `array[mid]` being greater than or equal to `find`.
