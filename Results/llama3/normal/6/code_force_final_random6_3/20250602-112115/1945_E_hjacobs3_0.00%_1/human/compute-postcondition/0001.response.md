The only variables in the loop head are variables `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is the length of `array`, `n` is at least 1, so `r` is at least 0. This ensures that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, so no adjustments are needed.

State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1**
