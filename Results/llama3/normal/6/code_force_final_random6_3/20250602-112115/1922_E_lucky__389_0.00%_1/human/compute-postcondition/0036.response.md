The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is less than 1, so the new value of `i` is at least 0. The other variables are not affected. The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, and `x` is at least 3 and 2, which means `x` is at least 3.

Output State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `i` is at least 0, `x` is at least 3**
