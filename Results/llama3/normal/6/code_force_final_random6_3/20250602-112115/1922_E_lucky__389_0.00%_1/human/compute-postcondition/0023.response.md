Output State: **The number of test cases is decreased by 3, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases is decreased by 3, the value of `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i + 1` is greater than `x + 1`, there is no input in stdin, the list `subseq_lens` is empty, `mx` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
