The code appends the fourth element of `subseq_lens` to `ansv`. The fourth element of `subseq_lens` is `subseq_lens[3]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences that must have at least 4 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with an additional three elements appended which are the second, third and fourth elements of `subseq_lens`, `i` is 3**
