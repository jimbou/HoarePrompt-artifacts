To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `subseq_lens`. The loop will execute if `subseq_lens` has at least 2 elements, since the loop starts from index 1 and goes up to the length of `subseq_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `subseq_lens` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences that must have at least 2 elements, mx is the maximum length of the subsequences, x is 0, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1, i is 1**
