Output State: **The number of test cases is decreased by 3, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2^i is greater than or equal to `x` and `i` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` contains the value of `i`, `x` is decreased by 2^i - 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `i`.**

In this output state, the number of test cases remains decreased by 3. The value of `i` is still the smallest integer such that 2^i is greater than or equal to `x`, but `x` has been decreased by 2^i - 1. The list `subseq_lens` now contains the value of `i`. The value of `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `i`.
