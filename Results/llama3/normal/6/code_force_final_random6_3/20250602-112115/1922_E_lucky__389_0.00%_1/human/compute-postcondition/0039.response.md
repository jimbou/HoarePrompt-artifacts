Output State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the number of test cases has been decreased by 3, and the value of `i` remains 0, which is the smallest integer such that 2^i is greater than or equal to the number of test cases. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
