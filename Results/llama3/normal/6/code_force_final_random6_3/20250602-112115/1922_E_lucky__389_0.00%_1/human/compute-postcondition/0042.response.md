Postcondition: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2^i > x, `subseq_lens` contains the value of `i`, `x` is decreased by 2 to the power of `i` minus 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `i`.**
