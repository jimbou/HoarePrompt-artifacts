The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 1. `x` being greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 3. `i` being 1 does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The number of test cases is decreased by 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3**
