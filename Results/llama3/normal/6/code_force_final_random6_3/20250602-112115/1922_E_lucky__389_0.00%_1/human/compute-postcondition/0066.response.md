Functionality: **This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads a list of integers representing the values of X for each test case. It processes these values by finding the lengths of subsequences that can be formed from each value of X, where the subsequences are constructed by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current value of X. The function then constructs a new list, `ansv`, which contains the integers from 0 to the maximum length of the subsequences minus 1, followed by all the lengths of the subsequences except the first one. Finally, the function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints all the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a blank line.**
