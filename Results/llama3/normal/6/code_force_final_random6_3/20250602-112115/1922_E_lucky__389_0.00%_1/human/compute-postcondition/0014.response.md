Postcondition: ***The number of test cases is a positive integer. If i is 0, the number of test cases is decreased by 3, stdin contains no input, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the number of test cases is decreased by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers (the values of X for each test case) with the first value (x) being at least 2^(i+1) - 1, subseq_lens is a list containing the value i, mx is the maximum value between its original value and i, x is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2^i - 1, and i is the maximum value that satisfies 2^(i+1) - 1 > x and i is not equal to 0.***
