Output: **The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`, and the length of `ansv` which is equal to `mx + len(subseq_lens) - 2` is being printed**
