Output State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3. `i` is 0, so the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `x` is greater than 0, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been set to 0, which means the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The other variables, `x` and `mx`, retain their original properties, with `x` being greater than 0 and `mx` being the maximum of its original value and 0 (which is 0). The number of test cases has also been decreased by 3, as stated in the initial state.
