The value of `ansv` is updated by appending the value of `subseq_lens[i]`, where `i` is 2. The value of `subseq_lens[i]` is the third element of `subseq_lens` since indexing starts at 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences that must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with an additional two elements appended which are the second and third elements of `subseq_lens`, `i` is 2**
