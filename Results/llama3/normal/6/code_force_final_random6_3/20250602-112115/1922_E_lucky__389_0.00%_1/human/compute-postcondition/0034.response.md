The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0 or less, so the new value of `i` is 1 or less. The values of the other variables are not affected. The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `x` is at least 3, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0. 

Output State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `i` is 1 or less, `x` is at least 3, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**
