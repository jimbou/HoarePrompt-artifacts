Output State: **The number of test cases is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers (the values of X for each test case), subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0.**

In this output state, the number of test cases has been decremented by 1, and stdin now only contains a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). The variable `subseq_lens` has been initialized as an empty list, and `mx` has been set to 0.
