Postcondition: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2^i is greater than or equal to `x`, `subseq_lens` contains the value of `i`, `x` is decreased by 2^i - 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `i`.**
