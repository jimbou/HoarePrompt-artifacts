According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 ** (i + 1) is less than or equal to `x` + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 or less, `x` is at least 3. `i` being 1 or less does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than 1. `x` being at least 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is at least 3 and 2 ** (i + 1) is less than or equal to `x` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `i` is less than 1, `x` is at least 3 and 2 ** (i + 1) is less than or equal to `x` + 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0**
