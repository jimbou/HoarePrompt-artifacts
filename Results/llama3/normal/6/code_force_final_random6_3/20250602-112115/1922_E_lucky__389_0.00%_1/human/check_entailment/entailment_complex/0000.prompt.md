Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). The number of test cases is a positive integer and each value of X is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18.
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, mx is the maximum length of the subsequences, and x is 0.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where mx is the maximum length of the subsequences and subseq_lens is the list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one, `i` is `len(ansv)`, and all elements of `ansv` are printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: a blank line

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads a list of integers representing the values of X for each test case. It processes these values by finding the lengths of subsequences that can be formed from each value of X, where the subsequences are constructed by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current value of X. The function then constructs a new list, `ansv`, which contains the integers from 0 to the maximum length of the subsequences minus 1, followed by all the lengths of the subsequences except the first one. Finally, the function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints all the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a blank line.
