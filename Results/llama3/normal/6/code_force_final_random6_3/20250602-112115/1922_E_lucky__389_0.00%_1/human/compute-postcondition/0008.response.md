The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The number of test cases is still a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2. stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers (the values of X for each test case) with the first value (x) being at least 7. subseq_lens is still an empty list, and mx is still 0.

Output State: **The number of test cases is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, `i` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers (the values of X for each test case) with the first value (x) being at least 7, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0.**
