The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `x` is unknown. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **The number of test cases is decreased by 3, `i` is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
