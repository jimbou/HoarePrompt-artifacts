#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). The number of test cases is a positive integer and each value of X is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18.
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, mx is the maximum length of the subsequences, and x is 0.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where mx is the maximum length of the subsequences and subseq_lens is the list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one, `i` is `len(ansv)`, and all elements of `ansv` are printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: a blank line

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads a list of integers representing the values of X for each test case. It processes these values by finding the lengths of subsequences that can be formed from each value of X, where the subsequences are constructed by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current value of X. The function then constructs a new list, `ansv`, which contains the integers from 0 to the maximum length of the subsequences minus 1, followed by all the lengths of the subsequences except the first one. Finally, the function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints all the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a blank line.
