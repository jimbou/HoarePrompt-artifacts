Output State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3. `i` is an integer, and its current value is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the number of test cases is still decreased by 3. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside, but does not affect the values of any variables.
