The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0. `i` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 or less. `x` being at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `i` is 0 or less, `x` is at least 3, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0**
