Output State: **The number of test cases is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers (the values of X for each test case) with the first value (x) being at least 1, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases has decreased by 1, so it is now equal to its original value minus 2. The stdin still contains a list of integers, and the first value `x` is still at least 1. The `subseq_lens` list is still empty, and `mx` is still 0.
