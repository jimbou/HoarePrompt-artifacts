Output State: **The number of test cases has been decreased by 3, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1, `x` is at least 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**

This output state means that the loop will continue to execute until the condition `2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1` is met, at which point the loop will terminate. The value of `i` will be the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. The number of test cases will remain decreased by 3, and the values of `x` and `mx` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
