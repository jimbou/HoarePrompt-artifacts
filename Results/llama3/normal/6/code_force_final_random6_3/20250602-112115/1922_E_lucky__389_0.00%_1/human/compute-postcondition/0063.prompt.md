Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`, and the length of `ansv` which is equal to `mx + len(subseq_lens) - 2` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ansv)):
    print(ansv[i], end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and this is printed: "0 "

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, and this is printed: "0 ", and the 2nd element of the list `ansv` which is 1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The number of test cases is 0, stdin contains no input, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences, `x` is 0, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens` appended except the first one and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and this is printed: "0 ", and the 2nd element of the list `ansv` which is 1 is printed, and the 3rd element of the list `ansv` which is 2 is printed, and the 4th element of the list `ansv` which is the 3rd element of the list `subseq_lens` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
