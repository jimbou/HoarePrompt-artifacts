Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that two given strings `a` and `b` match it, while a third string `c` does not. The matching condition is based on whether the characters in `a` and `b` are the same as or different from the corresponding characters in `t`.

Function `func_1` takes the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as input. It iterates over each character position `i` in the strings and checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If it finds such a position, it immediately returns 'YES', indicating that a template string `t` can be constructed where `a` and `b` match `t` but `c` does not. If it doesn't find any such position after checking all characters, it returns 'NO', indicating that no such template string `t` exists.

Function `func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly checks for the existence of a template string `t` that satisfies the matching conditions for strings `a` and `b` but not for string `c`. The use of `func_1` to perform the actual checking and `func_2` to handle input/output and test case iteration is appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
