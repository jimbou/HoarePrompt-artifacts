To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer**
