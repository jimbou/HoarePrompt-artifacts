Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to a positive integer, which is the input from stdin. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are also updated to strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, which are the next three inputs from stdin. The `results` list now contains one element, which is the result of the function `func_1` called with the updated values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Finally, stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
