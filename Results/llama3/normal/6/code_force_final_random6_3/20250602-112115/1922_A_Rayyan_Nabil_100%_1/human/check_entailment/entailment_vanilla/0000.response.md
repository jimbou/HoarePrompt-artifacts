Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if there exists at least one position i where both a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i]. If such a position is found, the program returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if a[i] and b[i] are both different from c[i], then a template t can be constructed by making the i-th character of t uppercase (since a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i], they must be different from the lowercase version of t[i]). This ensures that a and b match t, while c does not.

The program correctly implements this logic and covers all possible cases. It iterates over all positions in the strings and checks the condition for each position. If the condition is met, it immediately returns 'YES'. If the condition is not met for any position, it returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
