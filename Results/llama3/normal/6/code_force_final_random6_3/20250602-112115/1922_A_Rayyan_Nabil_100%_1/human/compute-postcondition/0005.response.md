The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `stdin` is empty**
