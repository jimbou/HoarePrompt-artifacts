Output State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing three elements which are the results of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is a positive integer. The second, third, and fourth lines assign the string values of the input to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The fifth line appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list, which now contains three elements. The `stdin` is empty after the code execution. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
