This function reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a positive integer t, then for each iteration of t, it reads another positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It calls another function func_1 with these parameters and appends the result to a list. After processing all iterations, it prints each result from the list. The function modifies the state of the program by emptying the input buffer and printing the results.
