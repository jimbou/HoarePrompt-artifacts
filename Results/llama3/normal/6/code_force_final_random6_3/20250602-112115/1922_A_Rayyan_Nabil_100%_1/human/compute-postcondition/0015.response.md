The `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list.

Since the exact `results` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element in the `results` list.

Output: **the third element in the results list (where result is the third element in the results list)**
