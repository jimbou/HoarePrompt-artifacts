Output State: **`t` is at least `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the last element in the `results` list which is `result` has been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `results` is empty because all its elements have been printed. The last element in the `results` list, which is `result`, has been printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
