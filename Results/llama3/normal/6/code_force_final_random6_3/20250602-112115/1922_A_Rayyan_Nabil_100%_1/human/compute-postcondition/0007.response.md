Output State: **t is at least t, _ is t-1, n is a positive integer, a is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable t will be at least equal to its initial value, the loop counter _ will be one less than t, the variables n, a, b, and c will still be a positive integer and strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters respectively, and the results list will contain t elements which are the results of the function func_1(n, a, b, c) for each iteration. The stdin will be empty as all inputs have been consumed by the loop.
