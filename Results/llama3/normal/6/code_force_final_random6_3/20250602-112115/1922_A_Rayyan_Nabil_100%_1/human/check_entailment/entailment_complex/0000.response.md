Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 compares strings a, b, and c of equal length n. It checks if there exists a character position i where both a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i]. If such a position is found, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that for all positions i, either a[i] or b[i] (or both) match c[i].

func_2 reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It calls func_1 with the input parameters and appends the result to a list. After processing all iterations, it prints each result from the list.

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. func_1 correctly checks if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. func_2 correctly reads input, processes it, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
