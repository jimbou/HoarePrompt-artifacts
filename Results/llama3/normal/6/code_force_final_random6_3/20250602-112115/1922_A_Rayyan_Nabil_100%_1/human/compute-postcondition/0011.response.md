To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `result` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in the `results` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 elements, and `result` must be the second element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is at least `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty**
