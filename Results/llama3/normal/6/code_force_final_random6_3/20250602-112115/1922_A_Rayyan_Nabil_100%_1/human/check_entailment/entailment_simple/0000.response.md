Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if there exists a position `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such a position is found, the program returns 'YES', indicating that a template `t` exists. If no such position is found after checking all positions, the program returns 'NO'.

However, the program's logic is flawed. The condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is not sufficient to guarantee that a template `t` exists. A correct solution would require checking if there exists a position `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, but not both. This is because the template `t` can have uppercase letters, which would require `a[i]` and `b[i]` to be different from `c[i]`.

Moreover, the program does not consider the case where `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both. In this case, a template `t` can be constructed by making the `i`-th character of `t` uppercase, which would match `a` and `b` but not `c`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
