Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function takes four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the length of the strings and the strings themselves, respectively. It iterates over the characters of the strings and checks if there exists a position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. If no such position is found after iterating over all characters, it returns 'NO'.

The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It checks for the existence of a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` by looking for a position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. This is in line with the problem statement, which requires that the strings `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It returns 'YES' if a template exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`, and 'NO' otherwise. It does not contain any logical errors or missing edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
