Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing two elements which are the results of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

The code block reads the value of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the standard input, and appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. Since `stdin` is empty initially, it remains empty after the execution of the code. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by the code, so they retain their initial values. The lengths of `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal to `n`, and they consist of lowercase Latin letters. The `results` list now contains two elements, both of which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
