The only object in the loop head is variable  result and list results, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 elements, result is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the result is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is at least `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty, and the third element in the `results` list which is `result` is being printed**
