This function compares strings a, b, and c of equal length n. It checks if there exists a character position i where both a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i]. If such a position is found, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that for all positions i, either a[i] or b[i] (or both) match c[i].
