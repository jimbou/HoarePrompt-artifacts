Output State: **`sz` is 2, `*_*` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once and must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions related to `sz`, `k`, `rgt`, and `rdb` are still valid, but no action is taken due to the `break` statement.
