This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, identifying duplicates and singles, and prints out a sequence of k integers, prioritizing duplicates and then singles, for both the left and right halves of the input integers. The function repeats this process for all test cases until standard input is exhausted.
