#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    T = int(input())

                ldb.append(lft[i])
            elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

    #State: T is 0, _ is T, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains no test cases, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is an empty list, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb, and elem is the last element in the list sng.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, identifying duplicates and singles, and prints out a sequence of k integers, prioritizing duplicates and then singles, for both the left and right halves of the input integers. The function repeats this process for all test cases until standard input is exhausted.
