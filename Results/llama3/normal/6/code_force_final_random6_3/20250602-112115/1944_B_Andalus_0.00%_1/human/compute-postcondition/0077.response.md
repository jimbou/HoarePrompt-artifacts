Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` and is incremented by 1, and `elem` is the third element in the `sng`.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, and since `sz` is already greater than or equal to `k`, the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is still met. The value of `elem` remains the same, which is the third element in the `sng` list. The values of the other variables are not affected.
