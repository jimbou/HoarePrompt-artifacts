Output State: **sz is k if k is even, otherwise sz is k - 1, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers, elem is the last element in rdb, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations and has printed pairs of duplicate elements from the list rgt until it has either reached the desired number of pairs (k) or has exhausted all duplicate elements in rgt. The value of sz, which keeps track of the number of pairs printed, is either equal to k (if k is even) or k - 1 (if k is odd), indicating that the loop has printed the maximum possible number of pairs. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
