Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb, and elem is the last element in the rdb that was printed twice.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, printing pairs of equal elements from the `rdb` list until either `sz` reached `k` or all elements in `rdb` were processed. The value of `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb`, reflecting the number of elements printed. The `elem` variable holds the last element from `rdb` that was printed twice. All other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the loop.
