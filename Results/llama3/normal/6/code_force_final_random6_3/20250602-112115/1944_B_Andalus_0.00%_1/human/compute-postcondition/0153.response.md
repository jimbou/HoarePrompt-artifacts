Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of rgt[i] which is also equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1], sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `rdb` now contains an additional element which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]`, which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
