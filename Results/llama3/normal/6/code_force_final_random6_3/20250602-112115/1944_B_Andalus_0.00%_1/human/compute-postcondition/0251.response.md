To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `T` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and `T` remains the same.

State: **`_` is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is the last element in the list sng.**
