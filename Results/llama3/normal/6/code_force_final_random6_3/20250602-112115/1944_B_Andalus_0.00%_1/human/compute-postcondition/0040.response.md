The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the first element in the `ldb` list twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `ldb` is a list containing at least one integer in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, and `elem` is the first element in the `ldb`, the printed value will be the first repeated integer in the sorted list `lft`.

Output: **[first repeated integer in lft] [first repeated integer in lft]**
