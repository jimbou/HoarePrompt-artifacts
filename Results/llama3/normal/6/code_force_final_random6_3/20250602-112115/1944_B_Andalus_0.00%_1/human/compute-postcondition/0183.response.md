Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb. This means that the loop will continue to execute until sz is greater than or equal to k or until all elements in ldb have been processed, whichever comes first. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
