Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 3, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] because rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1] or rdb was empty before this line of code and now it contains the current value of rgt[i].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list rdb now contains the current value of rgt[i], which is equal to rgt[i - 1] or was empty before this line of code and now it contains the current value of rgt[i].
