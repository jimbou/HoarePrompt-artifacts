Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `ldb` will contain all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, and the list `sng` will contain all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them. The list `rdb` will remain empty.
