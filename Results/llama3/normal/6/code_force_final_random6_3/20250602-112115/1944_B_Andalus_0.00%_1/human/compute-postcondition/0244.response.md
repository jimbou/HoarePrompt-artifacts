To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 3 elements, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus two, and elem is the third element in the list sng**
