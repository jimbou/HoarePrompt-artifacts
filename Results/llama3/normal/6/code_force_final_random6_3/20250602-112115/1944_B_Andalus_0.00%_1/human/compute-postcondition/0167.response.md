Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, elem is the first element in the list ldb, and sz is equal to the previous value of sz plus 2. If the new value of sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the first element in the list ldb which is equal to the previous one, and the first element in the list ldb which is equal to the previous one are printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sz has been incremented by 2. The program checks if the new value of sz is greater than or equal to k. If it is, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the program prints the first element in the list ldb which is equal to the previous one, and the first element in the list ldb which is equal to the previous one. The values of the other variables remain the same.
