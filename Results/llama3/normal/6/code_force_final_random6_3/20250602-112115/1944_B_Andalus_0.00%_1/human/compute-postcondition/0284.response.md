Output State: *_*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of i, which is now equal to n. The loop iterates from 1 to n, and in each iteration, it checks if the current element in the rgt list is equal to the previous one. If it is, it appends the current element to the rdb list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
