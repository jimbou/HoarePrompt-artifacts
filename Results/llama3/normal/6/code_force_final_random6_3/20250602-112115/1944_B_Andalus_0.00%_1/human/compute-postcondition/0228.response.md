Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 3 elements, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, elem is the third element in the list rdb, sz is increased by 2, and the third element of the list rdb is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been increased by 2, and the third element of the list rdb has been printed twice with a space in between. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
