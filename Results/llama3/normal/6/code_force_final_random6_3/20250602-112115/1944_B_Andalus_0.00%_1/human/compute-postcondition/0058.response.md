Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the last element in the `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the last element in the `ldb` is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the `ldb` list, and the value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the last element in the `ldb` list is printed twice, separated by a space. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
