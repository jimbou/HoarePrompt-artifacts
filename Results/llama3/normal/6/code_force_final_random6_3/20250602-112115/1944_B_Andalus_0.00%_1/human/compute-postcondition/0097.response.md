Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 2 elements, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, elem is the second element in the rdb, sz is increased by 2, and the second element in the rdb which is equal to elem is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been increased by 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The second element in the rdb, which is equal to elem, is printed twice, separated by a space.
