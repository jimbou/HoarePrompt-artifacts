Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, and `elem` is undefined. The element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i - 1` in `lft`. The current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `sng` now contains the element at index `i` in the sorted list `lft`. The value of `sz` has also been updated to reflect the new length of `sng`. All other variables remain unchanged.
