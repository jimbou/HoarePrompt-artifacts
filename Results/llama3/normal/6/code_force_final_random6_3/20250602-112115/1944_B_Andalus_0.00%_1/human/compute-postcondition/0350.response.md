To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `elem` and `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` has at least one duplicate element, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `rdb` must have at least one more element and the `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.

State: **sz is 4, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers, elem is the third element in rdb, and n is at least 2.**
