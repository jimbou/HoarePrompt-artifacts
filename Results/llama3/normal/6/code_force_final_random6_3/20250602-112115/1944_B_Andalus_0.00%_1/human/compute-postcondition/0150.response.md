Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of rgt[i] which is also equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1], sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng which is equal to the minimum of k and 2 plus the length of sng.**

In this output state, the value of rdb has been updated to include the current value of rgt[i], which is also equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1]. The length of rdb has increased by 1, and the value of sz has been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
