The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 and at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **_*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list of integers containing the current value of rgt[i] which is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined, and n is at least 3. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].**
