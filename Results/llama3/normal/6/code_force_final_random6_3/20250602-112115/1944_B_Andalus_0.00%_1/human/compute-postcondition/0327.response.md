Output: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus two, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in sng, and n is at least 2. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of sng which is elem is printed.**
