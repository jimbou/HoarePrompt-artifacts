Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `ldb` is either a list containing two elements which are equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` or an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` or a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` and another element, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng` which is either 1 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The list `ldb` is either empty or contains two elements from `lft`. The list `rdb` is empty. The list `sng` now contains the element at index `i` in `lft`, which is either the only element or one of two elements. The value of `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` (which is 0) plus the length of `sng`, which is either 1 or 2.
