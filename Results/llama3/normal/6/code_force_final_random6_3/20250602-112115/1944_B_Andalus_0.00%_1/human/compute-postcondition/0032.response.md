Output State: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, rdb is a list containing all the integers in rgt that are equal to the integer before them.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the variable i is now equal to n, and the list rdb contains all the integers in rgt that are equal to the integer before them.
