The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sng` is a list of integers, so it needs to be adjusted to `sng` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

State: **sz is k if k is even, otherwise sz is k - 1, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].**
