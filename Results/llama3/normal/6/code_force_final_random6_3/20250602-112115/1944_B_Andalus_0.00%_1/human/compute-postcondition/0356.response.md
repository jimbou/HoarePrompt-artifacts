Postcondition: ***sz is 6 if k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise sz is 4. _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers, elem is the third element in rdb, and n is at least 2. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the third element in rdb which is elem is printed twice separated by a space.***
