Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]` or an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft` or an empty list, and `sng` now contains an additional element which is the element at index `i` in `lft`**.

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `sng`, which now contains an additional element that is the element at index `i` in `lft`. The value of `sng` depends on the initial value of `lft` and the condition that `i` is 3 and `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`.
