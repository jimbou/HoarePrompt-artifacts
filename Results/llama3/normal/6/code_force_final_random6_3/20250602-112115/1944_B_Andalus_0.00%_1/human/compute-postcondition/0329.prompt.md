Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb, *_* is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, elem is the last element in ldb that was processed, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus one, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i]. If sz is greater than or equal to k, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element in sng which is elem is printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus two, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in sng, and n is at least 2. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of sng which is elem is printed, elem is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus three, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in sng, and n is at least 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
