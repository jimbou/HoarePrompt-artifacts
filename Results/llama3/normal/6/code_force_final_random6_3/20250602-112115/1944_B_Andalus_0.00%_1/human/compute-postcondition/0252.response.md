Output State: **_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined.**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by two.
2. The second line reads a list of 2n integers from stdin and assigns it to `lst`. This list is split into two halves: `lft` and `rgt`, each containing n integers between 1 and n.
3. The third and fourth lines sort `lft` and `rgt` in ascending order, respectively.
4. The fifth to seventh lines initialize empty lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`, respectively.
5. The eighth line assigns the minimum value between `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb` plus the number of elements in `sng` to `sz`. Since `rdb` and `sng` are empty, `sz` is assigned the value of `k`.
6. The ninth line assigns the last element of `sng` to `elem`. However, since `sng` is empty, `elem` remains undefined.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

* `_` remains unchanged at 2.
* `T` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 2.
* `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4.
* `k` is updated to an integer between 1 and floor(n/2).
* `lst` is updated to a list of 2n integers between 1 and n.
* `lft` and `rgt` are updated to sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n.
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.
* `i` is updated to `n`.
* `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are empty lists.
* `sz` is assigned the value of `k`.
* `elem` is undefined.
