Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 2 elements, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus 1, and elem is the second element in the list `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
