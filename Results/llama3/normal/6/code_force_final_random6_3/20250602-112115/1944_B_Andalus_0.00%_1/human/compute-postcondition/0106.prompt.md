Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is 0, and `elem` is the last element in the `sng`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, and `elem` is the first element in the `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 2 elements, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, and elem is the second element in the rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2 and the second element in the rdb which is equal to elem is printed twice, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 3 elements, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, and elem is the third element in the rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2 and the third element of the rdb is printed twice, with the value of the third element of the rdb, which is equal to the third element of the rdb.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
