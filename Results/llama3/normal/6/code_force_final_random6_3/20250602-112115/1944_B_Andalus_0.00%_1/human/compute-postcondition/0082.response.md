To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them. So for the loop to be executed, `rdb` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the `rdb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is 0, and `elem` is the first element in the `rdb`.**
