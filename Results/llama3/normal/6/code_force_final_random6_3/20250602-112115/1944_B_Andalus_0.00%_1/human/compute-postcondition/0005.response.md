Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `lft[i]` is still equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`. The list `ldb` now contains one integer, which is the same as the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
