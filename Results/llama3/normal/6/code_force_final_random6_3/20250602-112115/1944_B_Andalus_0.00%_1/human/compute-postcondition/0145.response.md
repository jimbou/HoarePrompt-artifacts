Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `ldb` is either a list containing two elements which are equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` or an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` or a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` and another element, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng` which is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.***
