Output State: **sz is 6, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers, elem is the third element in rdb, and n is at least 2. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element in rdb which is elem is printed twice separated by a space**

The value of sz has been increased by 2, so it is now 6. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true, including the condition that if sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element in rdb which is elem is printed twice separated by a space.
