Output State: **`sz` is at least `k`, `_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(`n`/2), `lst` is a list of 2`n` integers between 1 and `n`, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `rgt` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` that must have at least one duplicate element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once, `sng` is a list of integers, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of breaking out of the loop or if statement.
