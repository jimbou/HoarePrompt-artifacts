Output State: **_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the number of elements in the list `lft`. The list `ldb` contains all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once, and the list `sng` contains all the elements in `lft` that appear only once. The variable `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb` (which is empty) plus the number of elements in `sng`. The other variables remain unchanged.
