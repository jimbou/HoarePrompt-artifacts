To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and `elem` is undefined.**
