Output State: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus the number of elements in sng, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in sng, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i]. If sz is greater than or equal to k, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements in sng are printed followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus the number of elements in sng. The list sng is empty, and elem is the last element in sng. All elements in sng are printed followed by a space. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
