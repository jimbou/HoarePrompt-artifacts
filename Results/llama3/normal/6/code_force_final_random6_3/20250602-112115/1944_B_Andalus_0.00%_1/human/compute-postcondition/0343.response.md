The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least one element, elem is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **sz is 2, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers, elem is the second element in rdb, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i]. If the current value of sz is less than k minus 2, then elem (which is the first element in rdb) is printed twice with a space in between, without starting a new line.**
