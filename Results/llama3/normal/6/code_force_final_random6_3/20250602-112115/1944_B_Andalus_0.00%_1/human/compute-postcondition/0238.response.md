To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the list `sng`. The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is the current element being processed.

According to the state at the end of the previous iteration, `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and it must have at least 1 element. The first element of the list `sng` is `elem`.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least one more element. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `sng` to have at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next element in the list.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 2 elements, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus one, and elem is the second element in the list sng.**
