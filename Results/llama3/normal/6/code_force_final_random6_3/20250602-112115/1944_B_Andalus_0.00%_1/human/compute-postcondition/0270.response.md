Postcondition: ***_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3, rdb is an empty list, and elem is undefined. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing the value of lft[1], lft[2], and lft[3], sng is a list containing one integer which is equal to lft[2], and sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list containing one integer which is equal to lft[3], and sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng. Otherwise, the values of sng and sz remain undefined.***
