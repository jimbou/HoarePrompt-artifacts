Postcondition: ***`sz` is 2, `*_*` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the second element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
