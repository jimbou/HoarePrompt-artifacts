To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `elem` and the list `rdb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `rdb`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, and `rdb` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `rdb` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list `rdb`.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 3 elements, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, and elem is the third element in the rdb.**
