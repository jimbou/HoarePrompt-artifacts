Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. The element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft`. The current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `stdin` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `sng` now contains one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft`. The value of `i` is still 1. The conditions that the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft`, the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft` are still valid.
