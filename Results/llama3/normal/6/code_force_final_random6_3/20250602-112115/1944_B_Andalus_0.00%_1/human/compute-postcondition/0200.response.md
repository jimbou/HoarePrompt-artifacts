The code prints the third element of the list `sng` which is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 3 elements, followed by a space.
Output: **the third element of the list sng (which is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 3 elements)**
