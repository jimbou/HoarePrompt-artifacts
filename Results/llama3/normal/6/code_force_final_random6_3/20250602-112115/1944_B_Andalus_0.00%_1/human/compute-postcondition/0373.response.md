Output State: **`sz` is `k + 2` if `k` is even, otherwise `sz` is `k + 1`, `_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once, `sng` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of any variables.
