Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list of integers containing the current value of rgt[i], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined, and n is at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_* is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list of integers containing the current value of rgt[i] which is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined, and n is at least 3. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
