The code prints the first element of the `rdb` list twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the `rdb`, the printed output will be the first duplicate integer in the `rdb` list, repeated twice.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the first duplicate integer in the rdb list)**
