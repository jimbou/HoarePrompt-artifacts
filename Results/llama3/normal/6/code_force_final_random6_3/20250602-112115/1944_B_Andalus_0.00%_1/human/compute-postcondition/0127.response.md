The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, and `elem` is the last element in the list `sng**
