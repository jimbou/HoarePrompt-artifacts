Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing at least two integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is either 2 or greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the second element in the `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element in the `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, so it is now either 2 or greater than or equal to `k`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
