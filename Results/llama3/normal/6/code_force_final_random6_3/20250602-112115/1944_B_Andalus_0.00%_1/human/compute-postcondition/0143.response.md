Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing three elements which are equal to `lft[2]`, `lft[3]`, and `lft[3]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.**

The code appends the current value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Since `i` is 3, the value of `lft[3]` is appended to `ldb`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `ldb` is now 3, and the length of `rdb` and `sng` is still 0. The value of `sz` is still the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, which is `k`.
