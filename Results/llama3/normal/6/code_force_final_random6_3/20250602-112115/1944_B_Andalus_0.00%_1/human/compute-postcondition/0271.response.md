Output State: *_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the previous integer, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the previous integer and not equal to the next integer, and sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except for i, ldb, sng, and sz. The value of i will be equal to n. The list ldb will contain all the integers in lft that are equal to the previous integer. The list sng will contain all the integers in lft that are not equal to the previous integer and not equal to the next integer. The value of sz will be the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng.
