Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists.**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` in `lft`, which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
