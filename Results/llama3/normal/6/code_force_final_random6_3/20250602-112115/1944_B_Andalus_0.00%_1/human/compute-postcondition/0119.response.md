Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus 2, and `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus 2. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
