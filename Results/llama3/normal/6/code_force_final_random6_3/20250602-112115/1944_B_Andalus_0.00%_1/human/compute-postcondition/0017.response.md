Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T is still a positive integer greater than 0. The value of the variable _ is still 0. The value of n is still an integer greater than 3. The value of k is still an integer between 1 and floor(n/2). The value of lst is still a list of 2n integers between 1 and n. The value of lft is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n. The value of rgt is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of i is still 3. The value of ldb is now a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]`. The value of rdb and sng are empty lists.
