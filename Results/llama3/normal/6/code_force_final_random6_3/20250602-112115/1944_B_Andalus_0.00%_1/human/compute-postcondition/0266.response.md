The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **_*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing the value of lft[1] and lft[2], rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and lft[i] is equal to lft[i + 1], then ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one integer which is equal to lft[2], and sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list containing one integer which is equal to lft[i], and sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, otherwise, the values of sng and sz remain undefined. In all cases, i is 3, rdb is an empty list, and elem is undefined.**
