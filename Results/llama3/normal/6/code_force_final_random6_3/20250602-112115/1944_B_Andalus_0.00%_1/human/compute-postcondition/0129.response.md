According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, and `elem` is undefined**
