Output State: **sz is 4, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers, elem is the second element in rdb, and n is at least 2. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken., and this is printed: the second element in rdb which is [elem] is printed twice with a space in between**

In natural language, the output state is: sz has been incremented by 2 and is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same state, with the same conditions and values for all variables except sz, which has been updated.
