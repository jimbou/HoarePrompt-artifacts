Output State: **`_`*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3, rdb is an empty list, elem is undefined, and sng is a list containing one integer which is equal to lft[3], and sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng.**

In this output state, the value of sng has been updated to contain one integer which is equal to lft[3], and the value of sz has been updated to be the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng. The other variables remain unchanged.
