Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, _*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, elem is undefined, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *If `k - sz` is at least 2, then `sz` is 2, and all the initial conditions are retained. Otherwise, the program retains all the initial conditions: `sz` is 0, `*_*` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sz` is 2, `*_*` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the second element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz` is 4 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` is 2. `*_*` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once and must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the third element in `ldb` which is equal to `elem` and the third element in `ldb` which is equal to `elem` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
