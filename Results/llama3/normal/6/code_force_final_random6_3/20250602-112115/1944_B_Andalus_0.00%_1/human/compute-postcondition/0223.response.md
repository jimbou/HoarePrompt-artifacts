To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `rdb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 3 elements, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and elem is the third element in the list rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
