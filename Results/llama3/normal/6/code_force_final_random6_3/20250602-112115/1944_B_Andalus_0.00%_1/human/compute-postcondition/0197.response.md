To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `elem` and the list `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `sng`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list, and `sng` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `elem` should be the next element in the list, and `sng` should still have at least 2 elements. Since `elem` is the second element, the next element would be the third element in the list.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is equal to the previous one, `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is equal to the previous one, `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is equal to the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `ldb` plus two, and `elem` is the third element in the list.**
