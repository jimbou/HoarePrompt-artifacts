Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng, and elem is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. If the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list. `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2. If the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing two elements which are equal to `lft[1]` and `lft[2]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng` which is 1. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing three elements which are equal to `lft[2]`, `lft[3]`, and `lft[3]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `ldb` is either a list containing two elements which are equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` or an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` or a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` and another element, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng` which is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
