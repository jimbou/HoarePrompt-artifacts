To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 3 elements and `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` and is incremented by 1, and `elem` is the third element in the `sng`.**
