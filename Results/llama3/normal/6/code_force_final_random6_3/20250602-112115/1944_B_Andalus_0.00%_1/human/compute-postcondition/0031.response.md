Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 3, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] because rdb was empty before this line of code.***
