Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, and `elem` is undefined. The current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `ldb`, which now contains one element equal to the value of `lft[1]`. The value of `lft[i]` is still equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`.
