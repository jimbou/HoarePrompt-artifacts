The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sng.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus one, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in sng, and n is at least 2.**
