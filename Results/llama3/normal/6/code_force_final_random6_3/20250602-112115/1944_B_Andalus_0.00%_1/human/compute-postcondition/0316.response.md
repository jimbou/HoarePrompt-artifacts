Output State: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus one, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i]. If sz is greater than or equal to k, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element in sng which is elem is printed followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the values of sz, rgt, and the printing of elem are still valid.
