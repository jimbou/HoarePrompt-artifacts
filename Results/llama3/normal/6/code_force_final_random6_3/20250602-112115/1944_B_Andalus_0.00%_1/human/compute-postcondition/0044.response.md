To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, so we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `ldb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb` list. If `ldb` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` is a list containing at least one integer in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, and `elem` is the first element in the `ldb`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` must be the second element in the `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing at least two integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the second element in the `ldb`.**
