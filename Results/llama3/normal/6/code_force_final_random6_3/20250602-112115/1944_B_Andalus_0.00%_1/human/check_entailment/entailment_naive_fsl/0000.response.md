Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains duplicate elements that are not consecutive. In the current implementation, the program only checks for consecutive duplicates in the left and right halves of the array, and it does not handle the case where a duplicate element appears later in the array.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will not correctly identify the duplicate elements and will not produce the correct output.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle non-consecutive duplicates. One possible solution is to use a hash table to keep track of the elements that have been seen so far, and to use this information to identify the duplicate elements.
