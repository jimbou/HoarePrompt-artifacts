Postcondition: **If `sz` is at least `k`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, retaining all the initial conditions: `sz` is 0, `*_*` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and `n` is at least 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` has one more element than before which is equal to `rgt[i]`.**
