The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 2 elements, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus 1, and elem is the second element in the list `sng`**
