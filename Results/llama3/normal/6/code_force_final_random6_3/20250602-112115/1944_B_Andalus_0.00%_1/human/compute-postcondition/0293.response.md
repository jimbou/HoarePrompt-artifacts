Output State: **sz is 2, *_* is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once and must have at least 1 element, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, elem is the first element in ldb, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i]. The current value of (k - sz) is at least 0.**

The value of sz has been increased by 2, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of (k - sz) is at least 0, since k is at least 1 and sz is 2.
