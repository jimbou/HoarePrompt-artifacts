Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]` or an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft` or an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `ldb` is either empty or contains one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and the list `rdb` is empty. The list `sng` now contains one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft`, because the condition for `sng` to be non-empty is met when `i` is 2 and `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`.
