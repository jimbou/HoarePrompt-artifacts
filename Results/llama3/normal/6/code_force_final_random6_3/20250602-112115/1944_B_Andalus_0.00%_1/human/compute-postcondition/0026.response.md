The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` is an empty list.**
