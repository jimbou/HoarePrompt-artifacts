Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `i` is 1 and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `sng` is a list containing one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list.**
