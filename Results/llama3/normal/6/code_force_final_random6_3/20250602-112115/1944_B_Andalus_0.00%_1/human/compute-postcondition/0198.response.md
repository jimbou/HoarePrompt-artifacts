Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is equal to the previous one, `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is equal to the previous one, `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is equal to the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `ldb` plus two, and `elem` is the third element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `break` does not modify any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
