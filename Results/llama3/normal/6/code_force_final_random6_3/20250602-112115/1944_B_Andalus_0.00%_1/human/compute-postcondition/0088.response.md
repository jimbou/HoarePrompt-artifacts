Output: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, and `elem` is the first element in the `rdb`. The current value of `sz` is less than `k - 2`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the first element of the `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice separated by a space.**
