To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `elem` and the list `ldb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `ldb`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`. To execute the loop again, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing at least three integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is either 2 or greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the third element in the `ldb`.**
