Postcondition: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus one, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in sng, and n is at least 2. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
