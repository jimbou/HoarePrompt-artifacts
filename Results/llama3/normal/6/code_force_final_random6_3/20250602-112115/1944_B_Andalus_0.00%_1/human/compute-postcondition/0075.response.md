The code prints the third element in the `sng` list, which contains all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 3 elements, followed by a space.
Output: **the third element in the `sng` list (which contains all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 3 elements)**
