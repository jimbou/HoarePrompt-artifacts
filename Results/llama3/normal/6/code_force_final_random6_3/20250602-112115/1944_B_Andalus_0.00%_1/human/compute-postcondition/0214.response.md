Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 1 element, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, elem is the first element in the list rdb, sz is less than k minus 0, and the first element in the list rdb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, but the values of the other variables remain the same. The first element in the list rdb, which is elem, has been printed twice with a space in between.
