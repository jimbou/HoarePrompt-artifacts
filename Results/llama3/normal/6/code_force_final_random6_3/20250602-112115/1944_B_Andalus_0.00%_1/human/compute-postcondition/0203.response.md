Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb plus the length of sng, and elem is the last element in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates over the list `sng` and prints each element followed by a space. The variable `sz` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop breaks when `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or when the end of the list `sng` is reached. The final state of the variables in the loop head and body is as follows: `sz` is equal to the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `ldb` plus the length of `sng`, and `elem` is the last element in the list `sng`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
