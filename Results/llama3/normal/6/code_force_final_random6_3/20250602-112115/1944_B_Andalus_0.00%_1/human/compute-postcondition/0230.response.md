Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb, and elem is the last element in the list rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the last element of the list rdb is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, nothing is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `rdb` and has printed each element twice with a space in between if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. The value of `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb`, and `elem` is the last element in the list `rdb`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
