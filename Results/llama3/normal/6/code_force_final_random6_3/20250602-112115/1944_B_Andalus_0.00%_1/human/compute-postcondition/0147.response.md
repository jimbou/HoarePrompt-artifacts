Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` where each element is equal to the previous one. This means that `ldb` contains sequences of identical elements from `lft`.
- `rdb` remains an empty list, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one. This means that `sng` contains single elements from `lft` that are not part of a sequence of identical elements.
- `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`. Since `rdb` is empty, `sz` is essentially the minimum of `k` and the length of `sng`.
