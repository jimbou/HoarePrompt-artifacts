Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng, and elem is undefined.**

The code snippet reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, which are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The input list `lst` is split into two lists, `lft` and `rgt`, each containing `n` integers between 1 and `n`. The lists `lft` and `rgt` are sorted in ascending order. The lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The variable `sz` is calculated as the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, which is 0 since `rdb` and `sng` are empty. The variable `elem` is undefined since `sng` is empty.
