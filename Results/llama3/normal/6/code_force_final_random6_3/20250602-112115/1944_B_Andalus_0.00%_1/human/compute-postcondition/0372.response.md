The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`sz` is `k + 2` if `k` is even, otherwise `sz` is `k + 1`, `_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once, `sng` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`**
