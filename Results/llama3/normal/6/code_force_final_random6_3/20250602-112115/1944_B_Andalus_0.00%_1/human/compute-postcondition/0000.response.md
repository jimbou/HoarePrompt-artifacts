Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `T` is assigned a positive integer value, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 5 * 10^4, and `k` is between 1 and the floor of `n/2`. The second line contains `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, where each integer is between 1 and `n`, and every integer from 1 to `n` occurs exactly twice in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
