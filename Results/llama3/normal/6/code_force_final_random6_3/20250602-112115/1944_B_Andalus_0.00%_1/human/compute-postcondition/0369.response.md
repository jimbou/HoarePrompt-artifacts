Output: *`sz` is `k + 1` if `k` is even, otherwise `sz` is `k`, `_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list of integers containing all the elements in `lft` that appear more than once, `sng` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed**
