The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3. If the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing two elements which are equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng` which is 1. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.**
