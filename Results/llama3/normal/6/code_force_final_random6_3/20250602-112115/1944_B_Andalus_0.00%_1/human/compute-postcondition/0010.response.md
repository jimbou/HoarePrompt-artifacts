Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` and `rdb` are empty lists. If `i` is 1 and `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then `sng` is a list containing one element which is the element at index `i` in `lft`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list.**
