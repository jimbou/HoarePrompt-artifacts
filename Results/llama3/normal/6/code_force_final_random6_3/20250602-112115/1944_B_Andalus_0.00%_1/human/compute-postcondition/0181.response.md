Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is equal to the previous one, `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`, and `sz` is increased by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The program continues with the current state, and the third element of the list `ldb` which is equal to the previous one is printed twice with a space in between.
