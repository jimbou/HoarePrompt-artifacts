Output: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 2 elements, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus one, and elem is the second element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the second element of the list sng which is elem is printed.**
