To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in `sng`.

State: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus two, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in sng, and n is at least 2.**
