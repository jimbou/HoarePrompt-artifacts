Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` because rdb was empty before this line of code.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `rdb` now contains the current value of `rgt[i]`, regardless of whether it was equal to `rgt[i - 1]` or not, because `rdb` was empty before this line of code.
