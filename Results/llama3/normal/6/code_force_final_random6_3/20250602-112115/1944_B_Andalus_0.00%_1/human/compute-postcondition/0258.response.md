Output State: **`_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb` plus the number of elements in `sng`, and `elem` is undefined. The current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the current value of `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` is still 2, and `T` is still a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `n` is still an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, and `k` is still an integer between 1 and floor(n/2). The lists `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The lists `ldb` and `rdb` are still empty. The list `sng` now contains one integer, which is equal to the current value of `lft[i]`. The value of `sz` is updated to be the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb` (which is still 0) plus the number of elements in `sng` (which is now 1). The value of `elem` is still undefined. The conditions that the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, and the current value of `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` and `lft[i - 1]`, are still true.
