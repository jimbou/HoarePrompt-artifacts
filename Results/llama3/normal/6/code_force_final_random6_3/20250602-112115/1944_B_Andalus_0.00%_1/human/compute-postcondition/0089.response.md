Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `elem` is the first element in the `rdb`, and `sz` is less than `k - 2` and is increased by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2, but it is still less than `k - 2`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
