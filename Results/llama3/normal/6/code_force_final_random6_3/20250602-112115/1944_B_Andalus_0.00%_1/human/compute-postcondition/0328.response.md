Output State: **sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus three, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in sng, and n is at least 2.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the variables, such as the ranges of n, k, and T, and the properties of the lists lst, lft, rgt, ldb, and sng, are still valid.
