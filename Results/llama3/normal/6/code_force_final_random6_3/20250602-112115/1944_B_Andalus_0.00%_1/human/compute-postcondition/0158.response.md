Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables retain their initial values except for i, rdb, and sz. The variable i is now equal to n, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list rdb now contains all elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, as the loop has iterated over the entire list rgt. The variable sz is now the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus the length of sng, reflecting the updated values of rdb and sng after the loop's execution.
