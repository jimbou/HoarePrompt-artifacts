Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[1]` and another element which is equal to `lft[2]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`.**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated to include another element which is equal to `lft[2]`, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
