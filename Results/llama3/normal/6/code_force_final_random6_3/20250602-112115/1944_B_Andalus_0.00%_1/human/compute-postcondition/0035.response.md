The only variable in the loop head is `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them. So for the loop to be executed  the `ldb` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the `ldb`.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing at least one integer in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in the `ldb`**
