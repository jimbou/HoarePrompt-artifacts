Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of _ also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified in the code. The values of n and k are assigned from the input and are within the specified ranges. The list lst contains 2n integers between 1 and n, which are then split into two sorted lists lft and rgt. The lists ldb, rdb, and sng are initialized as empty lists. The stdin now contains one less test case as one test case has been processed.
