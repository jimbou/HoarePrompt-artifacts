Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus 3, and `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus 3. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed.
