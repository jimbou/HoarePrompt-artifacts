Output State: **T is 0, _ is T, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains no test cases, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is an empty list, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb, and elem is the last element in the list sng.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed T times, and all test cases have been processed. The variables n, k, lst, lft, and rgt retain their values from the last iteration, and the lists ldb, rdb, and sng have been updated accordingly. The variable sz has been updated to reflect the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb, and elem is the last element in the empty list sng. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
