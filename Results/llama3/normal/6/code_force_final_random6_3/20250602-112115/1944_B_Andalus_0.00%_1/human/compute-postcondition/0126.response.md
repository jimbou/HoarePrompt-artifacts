Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, and `elem` is the last element in the list `sng`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables `sz` and `elem`. The variable `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng`, indicating that the loop has executed for the length of `sng` times. The variable `elem` is now the last element in the list `sng`, indicating that the loop has printed all elements in `sng`.
