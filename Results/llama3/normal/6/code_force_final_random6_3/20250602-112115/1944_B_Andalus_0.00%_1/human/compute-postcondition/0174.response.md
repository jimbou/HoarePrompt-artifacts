Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is equal to the previous one, `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`, and `sz` is increased by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, but the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2.
