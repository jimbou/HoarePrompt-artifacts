To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

The only object in the loop head is `elem` and the list `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the `sng`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in the `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers in `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` and is incremented by 1, and `elem` is the second element in the `sng`.**
