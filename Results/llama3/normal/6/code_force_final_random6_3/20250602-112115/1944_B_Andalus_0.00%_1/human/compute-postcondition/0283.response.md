Output State: *_*_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng, and elem is undefined, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the value of i has reached n. The list rdb now contains all the elements from rgt that appear consecutively, and the list sng contains all the elements from lft that appear only once. The value of sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in rdb plus the number of elements in sng. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
