Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them. The current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `rdb` now contains the current value of `rgt[i]`, which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.
