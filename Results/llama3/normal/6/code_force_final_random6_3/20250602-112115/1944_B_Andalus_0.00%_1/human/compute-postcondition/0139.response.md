Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index 2 in `lft`, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus the length of `sng` which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the element at index 2 in lft, and sz is 1.
