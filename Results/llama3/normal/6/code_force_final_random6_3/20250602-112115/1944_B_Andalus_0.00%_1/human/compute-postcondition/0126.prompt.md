Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb, and elem is the last element in the rdb that was printed twice.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 1 element, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb plus 1, and elem is the first element in the list `sng`, and the first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus 2, and `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are equal to the integer before them, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them, `sng` is a list containing all the integers in `lft` that are not equal to the integers before and after them and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb` plus 3, and `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
