Output State: **sz is k + len(sng) if k is even, otherwise sz is k + len(sng) - 1, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in sng, and n is at least 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb has one more element than before which is equal to rgt[i].**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, printing all elements in the list `sng`. The value of `sz` has been updated accordingly, depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
