The only variable in the loop head is variable elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable elem. If elem is the first element in sng, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, elem is the first element in sng, sng has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the elem must be the second element in sng.
State: **sz is k + 1 if k is even, otherwise sz is k, _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n that must have at least one duplicate element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, ldb is a list of integers containing all the elements in lft that appear more than once, sng is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in sng, and n is at least 2.**
