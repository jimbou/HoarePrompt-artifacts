Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 1 element, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, sz is an integer, and elem is the first element in the list rdb, and nothing is printed. The current value of sz is greater than or equal to k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
