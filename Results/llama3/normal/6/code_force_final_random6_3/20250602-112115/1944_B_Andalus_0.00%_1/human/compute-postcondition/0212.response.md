Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the first element of the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

The first element of the list `rdb` is `elem`, which is the first element in the list `rdb`. Since `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is equal to the previous one and must have at least 1 element, `elem` is an integer between 1 and `n`.

Therefore, the output will be two identical integers, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the first element in the list rdb, an integer between 1 and n)**
