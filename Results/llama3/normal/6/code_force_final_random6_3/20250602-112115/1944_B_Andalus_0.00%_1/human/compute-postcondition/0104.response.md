Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list containing all the integers in lft that are equal to the integer before them, rdb is a sorted list of integers that are equal to the integer before them and must have at least 3 elements, sng is a list containing all the integers in lft that are not equal to the integers before and after them, elem is the third element in the rdb, sz is increased by 2, and the third element of the rdb is printed twice, with the value of the third element of the rdb, which is equal to the third element of the rdb.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable sz has been increased by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
