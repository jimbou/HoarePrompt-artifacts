The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sng. If sng has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb. So for the loop to be executed  the list sng must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2), lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n, ldb is a list of elements from lft where each element is equal to the previous one, rdb is a list of elements from rgt where each element is equal to the previous one, sng is a list of elements from lft where each element is not equal to the previous one and the next one and must have at least 1 element, sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb, and elem is the first element in the list**
