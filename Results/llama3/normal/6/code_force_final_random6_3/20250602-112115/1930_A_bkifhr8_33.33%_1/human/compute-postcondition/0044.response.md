Postcondition: ***t is an integer that must be at least n * 2 + 2, ans_f is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 1, lst is a list of strings, ans is the sum of the original ans and the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, stdin contains t-7 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-6 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-5 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-6 test cases. If the length of lst is not 2, lst has two fewer elements. If the length of lst is 2, lst has exactly 2 elements.***
