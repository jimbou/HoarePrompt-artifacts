To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus one, which means `t` is at least 1. So, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 0.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is 0**
