Postcondition: ***t is an integer that must be at least n * 2 + 2, ans_f is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, lst is a list of strings with two fewer elements if the length of lst is not 2, ans is the sum of the original ans and the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, stdin contains t-7 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-6 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-5 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-6 test cases. If the length of lst is 2, lst has exactly 2 elements and stdin contains t-8 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-7 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-6 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-7 test cases.***
