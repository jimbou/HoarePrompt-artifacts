Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is 0, ans is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is between 0 and `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is between 1 and n * 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst. If the length of lst is equal to 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of lst.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is between 2 and n * 2 + 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50, lst is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases if the length of lst is not equal to 2, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases. ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
