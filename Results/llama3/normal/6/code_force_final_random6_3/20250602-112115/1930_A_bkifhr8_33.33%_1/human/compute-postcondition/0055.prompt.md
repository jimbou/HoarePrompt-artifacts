Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), t is an integer equal to its original value minus one, ans_f is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-3` test cases if `n` is not 1, otherwise stdin contains `t-2` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ans_f` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `lst` is a list of strings. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is two elements shorter than the original `lst` and `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, `t-6` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is 2, `t-4` test cases if `n` is 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `t-5` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer that must be at least `n * 2 + 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing at least three elements where the last element is `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `lst` is a list of strings, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, stdin contains `t-8` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, `t-7` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is 2, `t-6` test cases if `n` is 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `t-7` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has two fewer elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` has exactly 2 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
