Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least `n * 2 + 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing at least three elements where the last element is `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `lst` is a list of strings, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, stdin contains `t-8` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, `t-7` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is 2, `t-6` test cases if `n` is 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `t-7` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has two fewer elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` has exactly 2 elements.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is appended to the list `ans_f`, which now contains at least three elements. The other variables remain unchanged, but the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. The length of `lst` remains the same if it was 2, otherwise it has two fewer elements.
