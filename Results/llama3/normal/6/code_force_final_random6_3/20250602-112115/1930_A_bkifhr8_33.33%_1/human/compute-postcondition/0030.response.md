Postcondition: ***t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, lst is a list of strings. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, lst is two elements shorter than the original lst and ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst. If the length of lst is exactly 2, ans is the sum of the original ans and the minimum of the first two elements of lst. stdin contains t-4 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-5 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-3 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-4 test cases.***
