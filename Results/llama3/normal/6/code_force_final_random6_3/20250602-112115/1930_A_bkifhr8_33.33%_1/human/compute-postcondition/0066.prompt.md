You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: t is 0, ans_f is a list containing t elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is n * 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is an empty list, stdin is empty.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing `n * 2` elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the last element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the last element of the list which is `i` has been printed

```

Return Postconditions: `t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing `n * 2` elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the last element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the last element of the list which is `i` has been printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
