Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is between 0 and `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`.***
