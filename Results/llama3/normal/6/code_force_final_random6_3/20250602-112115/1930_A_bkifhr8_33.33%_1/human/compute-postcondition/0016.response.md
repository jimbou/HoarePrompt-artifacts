Postcondition: ***t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is between 2 and n * 2 + 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50, lst is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases if the length of lst is not equal to 2, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases. ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst.***
