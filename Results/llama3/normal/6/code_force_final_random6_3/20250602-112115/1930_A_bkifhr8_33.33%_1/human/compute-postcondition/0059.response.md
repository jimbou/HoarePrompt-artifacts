The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `ans_f`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ans_f`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans_f` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 2 elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the second element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty**
