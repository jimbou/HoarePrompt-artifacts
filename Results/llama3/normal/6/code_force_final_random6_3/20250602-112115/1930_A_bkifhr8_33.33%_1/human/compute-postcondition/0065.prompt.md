Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, ans_f is a list containing t elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is n * 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is an empty list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in ans_f:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 1 element where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the first element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the first element in the list which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 2 elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the second element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the second element of the list which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 3 elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the third element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the third element of the list which is `i` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
