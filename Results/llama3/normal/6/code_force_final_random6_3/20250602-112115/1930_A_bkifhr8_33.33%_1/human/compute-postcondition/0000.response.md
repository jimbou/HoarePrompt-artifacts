Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), t is an integer equal to its original value minus one, ans_f is an empty list.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 5000, `t` becomes an integer between 0 and 4999. The second line creates an empty list `ans_f`. No other variables are affected.
