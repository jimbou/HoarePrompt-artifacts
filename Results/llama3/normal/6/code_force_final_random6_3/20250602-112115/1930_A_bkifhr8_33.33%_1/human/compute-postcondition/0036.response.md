Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ans_f` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `lst` is a list of strings. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is two elements shorter than the original `lst` and `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, `t-6` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is 2, `t-4` test cases if `n` is 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans_f` has been updated to include the value of `ans` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1 in all cases.
