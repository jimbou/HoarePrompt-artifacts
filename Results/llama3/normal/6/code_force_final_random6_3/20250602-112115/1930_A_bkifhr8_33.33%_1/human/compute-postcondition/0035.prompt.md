Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is between 3 and 101, ans is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is a list of strings, stdin contains t-4 test cases if n is not 1, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 1, lst is a list of strings. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst and lst is two elements shorter than the original lst. If the length of lst is exactly 2, ans is the sum of the original ans and the minimum of the first two elements of lst. stdin contains t-4 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-5 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-3 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, lst is a list of strings. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, lst is two elements shorter than the original lst and ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst. If the length of lst is exactly 2, ans is the sum of the original ans and the minimum of the first two elements of lst. stdin contains t-4 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-5 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-3 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, lst is a list of strings. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, lst is two elements shorter than the original lst and ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst. If the length of lst is exactly 2, ans is the sum of the original ans and the minimum of the first two elements of lst. stdin contains t-4 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is not 2, t-5 test cases if n is not 1 and the length of lst is 2, t-3 test cases if n is 1 and the length of lst is not 2, otherwise t-4 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
