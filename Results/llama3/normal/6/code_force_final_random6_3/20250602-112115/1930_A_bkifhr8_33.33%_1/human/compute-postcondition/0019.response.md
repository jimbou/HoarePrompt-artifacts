To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2` and `t` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n * 2 + 1`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `i` can take on values from 3 to 101.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of `ans_f`, `n`, `lst`, and stdin are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is between 3 and 101, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-3` test cases if `n` is not 1, otherwise stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**
