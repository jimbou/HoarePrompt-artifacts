Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is a list containing at least one element which is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst, i is between 3 and 101, ans is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is a list of strings, stdin contains t-4 test cases if n is not 1, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer that must be at least 1. The list `ans_f` also remains unchanged, containing at least one element that is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`. The value of `i` is still between 3 and 101. A new variable `ans` is introduced and initialized to 0. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 1 and 50, which is the input from stdin. The list `lst` is now populated with a list of strings, which are the space-separated values from the input string `l`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, so if `n` is not 1, there are `t-4` test cases remaining, otherwise, there are `t-3` test cases remaining.
