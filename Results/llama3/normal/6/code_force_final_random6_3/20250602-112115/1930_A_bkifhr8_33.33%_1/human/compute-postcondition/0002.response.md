Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is 0, ans is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans_f` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is set to 0 by the first line of the code. The value of `n` is set to an integer between 1 and 50 by the second line of the code, which reads an integer from stdin. The value of `l` is set to a string of 2n integers separated by spaces by the third line of the code, which reads a line from stdin. The value of `lst` is set to a list of 2n integers by the fourth line of the code, which splits the string `l` into a list of integers. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases as two lines have been read from stdin.
