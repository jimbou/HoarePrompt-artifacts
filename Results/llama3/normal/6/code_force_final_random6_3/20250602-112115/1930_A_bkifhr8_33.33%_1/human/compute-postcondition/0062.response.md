To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `ans_f`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ans_f`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans_f` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `ans_f` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`t` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 3 elements where each element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is the third element in the list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `lst` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty**
