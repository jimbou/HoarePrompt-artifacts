Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is between 1 and n * 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50, lst is a list of 2n - 2 integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst.**

The code adds the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to `ans`, then removes the first two elements from `lst`. The value of `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, and `lst` is shortened by two elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
