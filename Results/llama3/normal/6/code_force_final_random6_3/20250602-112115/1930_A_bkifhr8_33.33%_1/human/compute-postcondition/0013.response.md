The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n` * 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and `n` * 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least the integer part of `i` / 2 + 1.
State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list, i is between 2 and n * 2 + 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50, lst is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst. If the length of lst is equal to 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of lst.**
