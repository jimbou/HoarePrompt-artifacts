The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2`, `t` is an integer that must be at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n * 2 + 1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`. 
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least `n * 2 + 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `lst` is a list of strings. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is two elements shorter than the original `lst` and `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, `t-7` test cases if `n` is not 1 and the length of `lst` is 2, `t-5` test cases if `n` is 1 and the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `t-6` test cases.**
