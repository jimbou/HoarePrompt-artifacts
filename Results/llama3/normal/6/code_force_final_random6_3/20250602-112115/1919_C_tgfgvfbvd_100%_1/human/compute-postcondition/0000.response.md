The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input() function must return at least 1 and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, _ is 0, input() function must return at least 1**
