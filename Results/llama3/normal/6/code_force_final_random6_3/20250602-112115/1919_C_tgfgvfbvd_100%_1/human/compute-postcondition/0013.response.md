Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is positive infinity, and `c` is 1. In both cases, the value of `b` is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`.***
