Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is the second element of `l`. Otherwise, `c` is 1, `a` is the second element of list `l`, and `b` is the first element of list `l`.***
