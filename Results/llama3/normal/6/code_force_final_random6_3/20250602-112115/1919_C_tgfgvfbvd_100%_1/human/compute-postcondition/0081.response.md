Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then the first element of `l` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, the first element of `l` is greater than `b` and `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1.***
