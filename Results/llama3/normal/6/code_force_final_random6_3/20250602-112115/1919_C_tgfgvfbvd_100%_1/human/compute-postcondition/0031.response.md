Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is `n-1`. The value of `a` is either greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the last element of `l` and `b` is either the second last element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 0 or `n-1`. If the last element of `l` is greater than `a`, then `b` is the last element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or `n-1`). If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the last element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or `n-1`). Otherwise, `a` is the last element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the second last element of `l`, and `c` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of the second last element of `l`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the value of `x` is now `n-1`. The value of `a` is either greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If the last element of the list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` has been updated to the last element of `l`, and `b` is either the second last element of `l` or positive infinity. The value of `c` is either 0 or `n-1`, depending on whether the last element of `l` was greater than `b` or not. If the last element of `l` is greater than `a`, then `b` has been updated to the last element of `l`, and the value of `c` remains the same as before. If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` has been updated to the last element of `l`, and the value of `c` remains the same as before. Otherwise, `a` has been updated to the last element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the second last element of `l`. The value of `c` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, depending on the value of the second last element of `l`.
