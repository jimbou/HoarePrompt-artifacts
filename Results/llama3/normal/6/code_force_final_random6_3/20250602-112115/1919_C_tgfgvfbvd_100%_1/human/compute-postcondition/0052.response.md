Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, `a` is the second element of `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the second element of `l` was previously greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the second element of the list `l`, since `x` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the swapping of `a` and `b` still applies, but now it is based on the new value of `a`, which is the second element of `l`.
