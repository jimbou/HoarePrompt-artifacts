Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l`, and if `a` was previously greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `c` is 1, `a` is the second element of list `l`, and `b` is the first element of list `l`.***
