Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of integers, a is equal to l[1], b is an integer, c is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and x is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`, making `a` equal to `l[1]`. The second line increments `c` by 1, making `c` greater than or equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
