Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `b` is greater than `l[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `n`, `l`, `c`, `stdin`, and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. The conditions related to `l[0]`, `a`, and `b` are updated accordingly.
