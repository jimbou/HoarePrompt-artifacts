Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, `a` is the second element of `l`, `b` is the first element of `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is the second element of `l`, and if `a` was previously greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `c` is 1, `a` is the second element of list `l`, and `b` is the first element of list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `n`, `l`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, meaning that `a` now holds the value of the first element of list `l`, and `b` now holds the value of the second element of list `l`. The conditions related to `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
