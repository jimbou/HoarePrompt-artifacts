Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is `n-1`. The value of `a` is either greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the last element of `l` and `b` is either the second last element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 0 or `n-1`. If the last element of `l` is greater than `a`, then `b` is the last element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or `n-1`). If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the last element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or `n-1`). Otherwise, `a` is the last element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the second last element of `l`, and `c` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of the second last element of `l`, and c is printed ,c (where c is either 0 or `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and the last element of `l`)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are integers, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is `n-1`. `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`, and the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b` which is `c` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs, and `x` is `n-1`. If `l[n-1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[n-1]`. If `l[n-1]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[n-1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is equal to `l[n-1]`. If `l[n-1]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[n-1]` and `c` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is greater than `l[0]`, and the value of `c` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
