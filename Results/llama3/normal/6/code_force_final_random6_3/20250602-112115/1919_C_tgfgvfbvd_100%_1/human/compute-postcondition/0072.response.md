Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer greater than `a`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 0.**

The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, so `a` now holds the original value of `b`, and `b` now holds the original value of `a`. Since `a` was originally greater than `b`, now `b` is greater than `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
