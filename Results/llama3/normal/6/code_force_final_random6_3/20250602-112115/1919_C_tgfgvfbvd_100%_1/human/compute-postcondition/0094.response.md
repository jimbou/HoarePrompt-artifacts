Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 2, `a` is the third element of list `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If the third element of list `l` is greater than `b`, then the third element of list `l` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of the third element of list `l` and `b` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the third element of list `l`, which is accessed using the index `x` (which is 2). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `a` and `b` still applies, but now `a` has a specific value, which is the third element of list `l`.
