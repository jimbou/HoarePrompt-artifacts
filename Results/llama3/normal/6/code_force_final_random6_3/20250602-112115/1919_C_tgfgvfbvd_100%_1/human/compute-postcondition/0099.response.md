Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs, and `x` is `n-1`. If `l[n-1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[n-1]`. If `l[n-1]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[n-1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is equal to `l[n-1]`. If `l[n-1]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[n-1]` and `c` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is greater than `l[0]`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs, and `x` is `n-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the values of the elements in the list `l`. If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the last element of `l`. If the last element of `l` is greater than `a`, then if it is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is equal to the last element of `l`. If the last element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to the last element of `l` and `c` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. The values of `a` and `b` also depend on the first element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to the first element of `l`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is greater than `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is greater than the first element of `l`.
