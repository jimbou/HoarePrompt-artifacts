State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, `x` is `n-1`. The value of `a` is either greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the last element of `l` and `b` is either the second last element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 0 or `n-1`. If the last element of `l` is greater than `a`, then `b` is the last element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or `n-1`). If the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the last element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or `n-1`). Otherwise, `a` is the last element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the second last element of `l`, and `c` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of the second last element of `l`, and c is printed ,c (where c is either 0 or `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and the last element of `l`)**
