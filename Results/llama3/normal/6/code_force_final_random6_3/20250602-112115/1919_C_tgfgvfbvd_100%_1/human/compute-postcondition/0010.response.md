Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0. The value of `b` is less than or equal to the value of `a`. The first element of `l` is greater than `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a` and `b` has also been updated to reflect that `b` is now less than or equal to `a`.
