The code prints the value of `c`, which is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than `b`. Since `b` is the second smallest element in the list `l`, `c` represents the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element.

Output: **the number of elements in the list l that are greater than the second smallest element in the list l**
