Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of the first element of `l`, `b` is positive infinity and is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, if the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is 0. If the first element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is positive infinity, and `c` is 1. In all cases, the value of `b` is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 1. The value of `a` is either greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l` and `b` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is greater than `a`, then `b` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). Otherwise, `a` is the second element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the first element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 2. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`, `a` is either greater than or equal to `b` or swapped with `b` if `a` was greater than `b` before, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of the first element of `l` and the new value of `a` and `b`. If the third element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the second element of `l`, `b` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value of `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
