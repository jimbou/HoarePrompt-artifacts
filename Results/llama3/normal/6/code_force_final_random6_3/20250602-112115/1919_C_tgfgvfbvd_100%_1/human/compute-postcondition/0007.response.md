Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is positive infinity and is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `l[x]`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still positive infinity and is either greater than or equal to the new value of `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
