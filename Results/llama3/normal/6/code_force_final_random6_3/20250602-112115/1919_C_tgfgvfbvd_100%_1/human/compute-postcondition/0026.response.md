Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 2, `a` is the second element of `l`, `b` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity if the first element of `l` is less than or equal to the new value of `a`, otherwise `b` is the second element of `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of the first element of `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is now the second element of the list `l`. The value of `b` depends on the comparison between the first element of `l` and the new value of `a`. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to the new value of `a`, then `b` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is the second element of `l`. The value of `c` remains either 0 or 1, depending on the value of the first element of `l`. The values of `n`, `l`, `stdin`, and `x` remain unchanged.
