Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is equal to `l[1]`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 1. If `a` is greater than `l[1]`, then if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `l[1]`, `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `l[1]`, `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, `l[1]` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`. If `a` is not greater than `l[1]`, then if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `l[1]`, `l[0]` is equal to `l[1]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `l[1]`, `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `l[1]`, and the conditions related to `b` have been updated accordingly. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
