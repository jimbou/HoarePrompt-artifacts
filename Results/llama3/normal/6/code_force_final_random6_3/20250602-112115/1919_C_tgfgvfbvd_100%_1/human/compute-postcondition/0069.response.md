Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is a list of integers, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is n-1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The list `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to positive infinity. The value of `c` is updated to 0. The number of inputs in stdin is reduced by 2. The value of `x` is still `n-1`.
