Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is equal to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is greater than `l[0]`.***
