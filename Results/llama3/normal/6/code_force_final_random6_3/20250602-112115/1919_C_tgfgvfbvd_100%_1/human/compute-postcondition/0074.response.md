Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 0. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `b` is greater than `a`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.**
