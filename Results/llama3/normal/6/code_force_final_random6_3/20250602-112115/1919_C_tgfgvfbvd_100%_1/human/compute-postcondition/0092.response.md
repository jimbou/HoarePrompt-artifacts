The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 2, `a` and `b` are swapped, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**
