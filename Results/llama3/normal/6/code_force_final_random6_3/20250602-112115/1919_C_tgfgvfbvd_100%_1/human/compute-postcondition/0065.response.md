Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are integers, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is `n-1`. `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `a` and `b` will hold the two smallest elements in the list `l`, and `c` will count the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element (`b`). The loop ensures that `a` and `b` are always the smallest and second smallest elements seen so far, and `c` is incremented whenever an element greater than `b` is encountered.
