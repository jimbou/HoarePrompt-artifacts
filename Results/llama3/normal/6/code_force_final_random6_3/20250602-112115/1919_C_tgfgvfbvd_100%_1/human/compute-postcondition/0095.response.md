Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 2, `b` is the third element of `l` (since indexing starts at 0), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` is now the third element of the list `l`, while the values of `n`, `l`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. The relationship between `a` and `b` is still dependent on their relative values, and the input stream still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
