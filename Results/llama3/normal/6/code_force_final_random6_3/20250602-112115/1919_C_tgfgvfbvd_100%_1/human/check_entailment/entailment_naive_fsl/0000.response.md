Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it implements a greedy algorithm that splits the input array into two subsequences `s` and `t` in a way that minimizes the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

The key insight is that the penalty is only incurred when an element in a subsequence is greater than the previous element. Therefore, the algorithm tries to assign each element to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which minimizes the penalty.

The use of `float('inf')` to initialize `a` and `b` ensures that the first element of the array is assigned to `a`, and subsequent elements are assigned to `a` or `b` based on the comparison.

The program correctly handles the case where all elements are equal, in which case the penalty is 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has only one element, in which case the penalty is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
