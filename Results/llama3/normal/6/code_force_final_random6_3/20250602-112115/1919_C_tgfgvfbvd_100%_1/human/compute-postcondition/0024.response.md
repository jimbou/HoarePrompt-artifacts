Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 2. The value of `b` is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l` and `a` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). Otherwise, `b` is the second element of `l`, and `a` is either positive infinity or the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the first element of `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `l`, `stdin`, and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so the new value of `a` is the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is the old value of `a`. The conditions related to `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated accordingly, with `b` taking the place of `a` in the original conditions.
