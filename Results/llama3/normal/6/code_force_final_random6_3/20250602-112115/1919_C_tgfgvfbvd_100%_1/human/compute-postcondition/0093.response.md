Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
