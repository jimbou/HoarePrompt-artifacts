Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 1. The value of `a` is either greater than or equal to the value of `b`. If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). Otherwise, `a` is the second element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the first element of `l`.***
