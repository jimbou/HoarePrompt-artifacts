Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 2. The values of `a` and `b` are either greater than or equal to each other. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to the new value of `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l` and `b` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is greater than the new value of `a`, then `b` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to the new value of `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l` and the value of `c` remains the same as before (either 0 or 1). Otherwise, `a` is the second element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the first element of `l`.**
