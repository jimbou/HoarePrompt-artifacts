Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 2. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`, `a` is either greater than or equal to `b` or swapped with `b` if `a` was greater than `b` before, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of the first element of `l` and the new value of `a` and `b`. If the third element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the second element of `l`, `b` is either the first element of `l` or positive infinity, and `c` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value of `c`.***
