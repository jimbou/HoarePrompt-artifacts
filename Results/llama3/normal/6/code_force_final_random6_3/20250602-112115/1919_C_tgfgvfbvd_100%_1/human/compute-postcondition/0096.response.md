Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, x is 2, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `a` has been assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
