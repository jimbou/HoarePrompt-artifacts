Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer greater than `a`, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. However, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. Initially, `a` was greater than `b`, but after the swap, `b` is now greater than `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
