The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of the first element of `l`, `b` is positive infinity and is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, if the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value of the first element of `l`, and `c` is 0. If the first element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is positive infinity, and `c` is 1. In all cases, the value of `b` is either greater than or equal to the value of `a`.**
