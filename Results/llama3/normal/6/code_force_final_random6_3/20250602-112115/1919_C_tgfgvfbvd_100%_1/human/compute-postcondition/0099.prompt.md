Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is a list of integers, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is n-1.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 0. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `l[0]` is equal to `b`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then `b` is greater than `l[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `x` is 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is equal to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is equal to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is not greater than `b`, `b` is greater than `l[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If the third element of list `l` is greater than `b`, then the third element of list `l` and `b` are swapped. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
