Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is 1. In both cases, the first element of `l` is greater than either `a` or `b`.***
