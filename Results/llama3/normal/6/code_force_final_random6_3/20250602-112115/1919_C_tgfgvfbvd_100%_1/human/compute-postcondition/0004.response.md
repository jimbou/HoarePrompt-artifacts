The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since the current value of `a` is greater than the current value of `b`, after the swap, the current value of `b` will be greater than the current value of `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0. The current value of `b` is greater than the current value of `a`.**
