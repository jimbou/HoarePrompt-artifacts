Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `input()` must return at least 1, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The third line assigns positive infinity to `a` and `b`. The fourth line assigns 0 to `c`. No other variables are affected.
