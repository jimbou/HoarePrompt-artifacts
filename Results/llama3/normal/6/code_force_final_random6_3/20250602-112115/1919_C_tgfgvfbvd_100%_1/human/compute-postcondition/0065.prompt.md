Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is a list of integers, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is n-1.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the first element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is 1. In all cases, the first element of `l` is either equal to `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is the second element of `l`, and if `a` was previously greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `c` is 1, `a` is the second element of list `l`, and `b` is the first element of list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is the second element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is the second element of list `l`, and `b` is the first element of list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
