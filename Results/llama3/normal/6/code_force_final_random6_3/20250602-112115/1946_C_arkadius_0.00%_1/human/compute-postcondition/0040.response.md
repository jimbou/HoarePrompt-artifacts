State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which is a tuple containing the child of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the next child of vertex `v` and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False**
