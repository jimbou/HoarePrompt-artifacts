Output State: **n is at least 1, i is n-1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes and n-1 additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1, u and v are integers, input is empty**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of i will be n-1, and the tree will have n-1 additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1. The values of n and k remain unchanged, and the input is empty.
