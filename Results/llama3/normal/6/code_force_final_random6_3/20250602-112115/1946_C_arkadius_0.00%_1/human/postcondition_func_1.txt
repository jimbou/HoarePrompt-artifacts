This function calculates and returns the total number of "good components" and the total "remaining size" in a tree data structure, starting from a given vertex and considering a specified positive integer threshold. It recursively traverses the tree, aggregating good components and remaining sizes from child vertices, and increments the good components count when a subtree's remaining size meets or exceeds the threshold. The function returns a tuple containing these two aggregated values.
