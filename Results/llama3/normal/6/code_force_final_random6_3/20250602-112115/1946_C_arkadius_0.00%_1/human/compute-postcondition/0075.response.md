Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the last child of `v`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, with the only changes being in the loop head and body. The `tree` object remains unchanged, `s` and `x` retain their non-negative integer values, and `postorder` is still the popped value from the stack. The `stack` now contains tuples for all children `u` of the vertex `v`, with each tuple containing the child vertex and a boolean value `False`, in addition to the tuple containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True`. The vertex `v` must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, and `u` is the last child of `v`.
