Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before.**

In this output state, the values of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `v` is now the popped value from the stack, and the value of `postorder` is also the popped value from the stack. The stack is not empty but has one less element than before, as one element has been popped from it.
