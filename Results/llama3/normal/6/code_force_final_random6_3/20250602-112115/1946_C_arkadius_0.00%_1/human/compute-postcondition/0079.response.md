Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the first child of `v`, and the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains the same with n vertices, s and x remain non-negative integers, the postorder and stack also remain the same. The vertex v has its good_components increased by the good_components of its first child u.
