The only object in the loop head is variable  `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the children of `tree.vertices[v]`. If `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 2 children the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 1 child, `u` is one of the children of `tree.vertices[v]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children and the `u` is the second child of `tree.vertices[v]`.
State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `tree.vertices[v]`.**
