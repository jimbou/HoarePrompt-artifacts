To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `beg` and `end` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `beg < end`. At the end of the last iteration, there are two possible scenarios:

1. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is `(n+2)/2` and `end` is `n`. In this case, `beg` is less than `end` only if `(n+2)/2` is less than `n`, which is true since `n` is greater than 2. So, no adjustment is needed in this scenario.

2. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns False, then `beg` is 1, `mid` is `((n+2)/2 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2`, and `end` is `(n+2)/2 - 1`. In this case, `beg` is less than `end` only if 1 is less than `(n+2)/2 - 1`, which is true since `n` is greater than 2. So, no adjustment is needed in this scenario either.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `beg` is still less than `end` after the next iteration. Since `beg` and `end` are not updated in the loop body, we can't make any assumptions about their values after the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure that `beg` is still less than `end` after the next iteration.

Since `n` is greater than 2, we can adjust it to be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure that `beg` is still less than `end` after the next iteration.

State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3. `k` is a non-negative integer. If the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is (n+2)/2 and `end` is `n`. Otherwise, `beg` is 1, `mid` is ((n+2)/2 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2, and `end` is (n+2)/2 - 1.**
