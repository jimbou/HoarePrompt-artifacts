Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the first child of `v`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`, and the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`, which is less than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the tree object remains unchanged except for the vertex `v`, whose `remaining_size` is increased by the `remaining_size` of its child `u`, which is less than `x`. The other variables, such as `s`, `x`, `postorder`, and `stack`, remain unchanged.
