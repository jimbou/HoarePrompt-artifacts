Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` has two tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, and the second child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged with n vertices. The values of s and x also remain the same. The postorder is still the popped value from the stack. The stack now contains three tuples: the first tuple contains the popped value v and a boolean value True, the second tuple contains the first child u of v and a boolean value False, and the third tuple contains the second child u of v and a boolean value False. The vertex v still has at least 2 children, and u is still the second child of v.
