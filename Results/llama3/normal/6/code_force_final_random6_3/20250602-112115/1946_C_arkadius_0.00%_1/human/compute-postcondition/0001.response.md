To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1` (because the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value), we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**
