Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes and two additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1, u and v are integers, input is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The `tree` object now has two additional edges between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, as specified by the input values `u` and `v`. The `input` is empty, as it has been consumed by the `input()` function.
