Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `tree.vertices[v]`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + 1` which is equal to `tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1 + tree.vertices[v].good_components`**
