Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is empty, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least `len(tree.vertices[v].children)` children, and `u` is the last child of vertex `v` and is now popped from the stack with a boolean value False. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the tree remains unchanged with `n` vertices, `s` remains a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `x` remains a non-negative integer. The stack is now empty, and `v` is the last popped value from the stack. The postorder traversal is also empty. The number of children of `tree.vertices[v]` is at least `len(tree.vertices[v].children)`, and `u` is the last child of vertex `v` that has been popped from the stack with a boolean value False. If the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the good components of `tree.vertices[v]` are increased by 1. Otherwise, the good components of `tree.vertices[v]` are increased by the good components of `tree.vertices[u]`, and the remaining size of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]`.
