Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before.**

In this output state, the value of `v` is updated to the popped value from the stack, and a new variable `postorder` is introduced with the same popped value. The other variables, `tree`, `s`, and `x`, remain unchanged. The stack is not empty but has one less element than before, as one element has been popped.
