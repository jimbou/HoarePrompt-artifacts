Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of the vertex `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged with n vertices. The values of s, x, v, stack, and postorder remain the same. The vertex v still has at least 2 children, and u is still the second child of v. The good_components of vertex v is still increased by the good_components of vertex u. Additionally, the remaining_size of vertex v is now increased by the remaining_size of vertex u.
