Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of the vertex `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged with n vertices. The values of s, x, and v remain the same. The stack is still empty, and the postorder flag is still True. The vertex v still has at least 3 children, and u is still the third child of vertex v. However, the good_components attribute of vertex v has been incremented by 1.
