Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before. The current value of `postorder` is not empty. If `postorder` is not empty, then `stack` is not empty, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least `len(tree.vertices[v].children)` children, and `u` is the last child of vertex `v` and is now popped from the stack with a boolean value False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
