Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus one, `u` is the second child of `v`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`, and if the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by one, otherwise, the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`, which is less than `x`, and the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`. This means that the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` now includes the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`, which is less than `x`.
