Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the implementation of the `func_1` and `func_2` functions. These functions are supposed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing k edges. However, they do not correctly handle the case when a subtree has a good component that is not connected to the rest of the tree.

For example, consider a tree with the following structure:

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5

If we remove the edge between nodes 2 and 3, the tree will split into two connected components: {1, 2, 4, 5} and {3}. However, the `func_1` and `func_2` functions will not correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree in this case.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when a subtree has a good component that is not connected to the rest of the tree. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a depth-first search, to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

Here is an example of how the `func_1` and `func_2` functions could be modified to correctly handle this case:

```python
def func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        (v, postorder) = stack.pop()
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        if postorder:
            good_components = 0
            remaining_size = 0
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                (good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree) = func_1(tree, u, x)
                good_components += good_components_subtree
                if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
                    good_components += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
            if remaining_size >= x:
                good_components += 1
            return (good_components, remaining_size)

def func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        (good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree) = func_2(tree, u, x)
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
    if remaining_size >= x:
        good_components += 1
    return (good_components, remaining_size)
```

With these modifications, the program should correctly handle all potential cases and produce the correct output.
