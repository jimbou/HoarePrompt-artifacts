State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of the vertex `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`**
