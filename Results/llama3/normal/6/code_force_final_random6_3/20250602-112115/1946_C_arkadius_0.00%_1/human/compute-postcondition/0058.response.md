Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `tree.vertices[v]`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`***
