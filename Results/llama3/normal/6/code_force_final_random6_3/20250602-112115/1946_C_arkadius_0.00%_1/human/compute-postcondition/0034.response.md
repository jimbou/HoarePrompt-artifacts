Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, and `stack` is an empty list. If `postorder` is `True`, then the function executes and updates the `tree.vertices[v]` based on the conditions. If `postorder` is `False`, then the function does not execute. In the case where `postorder` is `True`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.***
