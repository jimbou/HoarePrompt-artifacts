Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer. If `postorder` is empty, no changes are made. Otherwise, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus three, `u` is the last child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`.***
