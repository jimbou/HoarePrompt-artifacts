Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3. `k` is a non-negative integer. If the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2, `end` is `n`, and `mid` is ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `beg` is ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2), `end` is (n+2)/2 - 1, and `mid` is ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2).**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure and the value of k remain unchanged. The value of `beg` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which depends on the return value of the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. If the function returns True, then `beg` is set to the value of `mid`, which is ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `beg` is set to the value of `mid`, which is ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2). The values of `end` and `mid` remain the same as before.
