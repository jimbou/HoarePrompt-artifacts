Output State: *`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the last child of the vertex `v` that was processed in the loop. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size*.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that `tree.vertices[v]` has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, and `u` is the last child of the vertex `v` that was processed in the loop.
