Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is one of the children of `tree.vertices[v]`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, and the remaining size of `tree.vertices[v]` is less than `x` plus the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains the same with `n` vertices, and the values of `s` and `x` are unchanged. The stack has one less element than before, and `v` and `postorder` are the popped values from the stack. The children of `tree.vertices[v]` still have at least one child, and `u` is one of them. The good components of `tree.vertices[v]` are increased by the good components of `tree.vertices[u]`. The remaining size of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]`, and this new remaining size is less than `x` plus the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]`.
