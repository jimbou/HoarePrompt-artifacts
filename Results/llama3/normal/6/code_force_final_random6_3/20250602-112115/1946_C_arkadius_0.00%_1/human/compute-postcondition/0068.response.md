Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which is a tuple containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True`.**

In this output state, the code has appended a tuple containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` to the stack, increasing its size by one. The other variables remain unchanged, with `tree` still being a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` being a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `x` being a non-negative integer. The `postorder` variable is still the popped value from the stack, and the stack is not empty with one more element than before.
