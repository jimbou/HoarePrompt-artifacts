Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the first child of `v`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]` plus one, and the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]` is still greater than or equal to `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged with `n` vertices, and the values of `s` and `x` are still the same. The `postorder` and `stack` also remain unchanged. The vertex `v` still has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, and `u` is still the first child of `v`. The `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by 1 plus the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`, and the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]` is still greater than or equal to `x`.
