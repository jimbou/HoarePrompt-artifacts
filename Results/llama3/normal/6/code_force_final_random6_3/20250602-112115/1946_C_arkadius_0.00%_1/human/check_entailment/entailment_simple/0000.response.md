Reasoning: The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving a tree with n vertices, where the task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the lower and upper bounds of the search range, beg and end, to 1 and n, respectively. Then, it enters a loop that continues until beg is no longer less than end.

Inside the loop, the program calculates the midpoint of the current search range, mid, and checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid. This is done by calling the function func_3, which returns True if it is possible to remove the edges and False otherwise.

If func_3 returns True, the program updates the lower bound of the search range, beg, to mid. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound, end, to mid - 1.

Once the loop exits, the program returns the value of beg, which is the maximum value of x that satisfies the condition.

The program also includes functions to read input, create a tree data structure, and perform other necessary operations.

Based on the provided execution states, the program appears to be correct. It correctly initializes the search range, updates the bounds based on the result of func_3, and returns the maximum value of x.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
