Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is one of the children of `tree.vertices[v]`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Additionally, the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]` is less than `x`***
