Determines if a tree data structure has at least k connected components of size at least x, or if the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x, where k and x are integers and the tree has n vertices with 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. The function returns True if either condition is met, and False otherwise.
