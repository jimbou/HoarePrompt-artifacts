Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which is a tuple containing the popped value from the stack and a boolean value True.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which is a tuple containing the child of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is one of the children of vertex `v` and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has two more elements than before which are tuples containing the children of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the next child of vertex `v` and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` has three more elements than before which are tuples containing the children of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child of vertex `v` and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False, and the stack now has one more element which is a tuple containing the second child of vertex `v` and a boolean value False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
