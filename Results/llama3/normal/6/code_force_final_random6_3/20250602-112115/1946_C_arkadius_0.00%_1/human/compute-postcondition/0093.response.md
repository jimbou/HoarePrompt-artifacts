Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus two, `u` is the third child of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains the same with n vertices, s and x remain non-negative integers, the postorder and stack also remain unchanged. The vertex v still has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus two, and u is still the third child of v. The good_components of vertex v is increased by the good_components of vertex u, and the remaining_size of vertex v is also increased by the remaining_size of vertex u.
