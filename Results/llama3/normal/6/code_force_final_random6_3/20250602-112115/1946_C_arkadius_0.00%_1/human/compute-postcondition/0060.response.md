Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `tree.vertices[v]`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**.

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The `tree` object still has `n` vertices, `s` is still a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is still a non-negative integer, `v` is still the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is still the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is still not empty but has one less element than before. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].children` still has at least 3 children, and `u` is still the third child of `tree.vertices[v]`.
