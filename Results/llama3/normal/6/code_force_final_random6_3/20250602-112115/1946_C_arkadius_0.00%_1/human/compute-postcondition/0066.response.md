The only variable in the loop head is variable stack, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable stack.  If stack is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stack is not empty but has one less element than before, So for the loop to be executed one more time stack must have at least one element.
State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty and has at least one element.**
