Output: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `n-1` additional edges between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, `u` and `v` are integers, `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` has been executed and returned, and the result of the function `func_4` with arguments `tree`, `n`, and `k` is being printed**
