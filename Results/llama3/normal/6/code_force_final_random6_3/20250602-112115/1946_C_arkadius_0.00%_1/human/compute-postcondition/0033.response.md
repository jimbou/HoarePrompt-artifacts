Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the last child of the vertex `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the tree object remains unchanged, the values of `s`, `x`, and `v` remain the same, and the stack is still empty. The postorder value is still `True`. The vertex `v` has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop. The variable `u` is the last child of the vertex `v`. If the remaining size of the last child `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the good components of the vertex `v` are increased by 1. Otherwise, the good components of the vertex `v` are increased by the good components of the last child `u`, and the remaining size of the vertex `v` is increased by the remaining size of the last child `u`.
