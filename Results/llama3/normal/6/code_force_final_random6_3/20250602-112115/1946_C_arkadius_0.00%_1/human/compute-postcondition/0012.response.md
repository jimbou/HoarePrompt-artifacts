Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than 2. `k` is a non-negative integer. If the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is (n+2)/2 and `end` is `n`. Otherwise, `beg` is 1, `mid` is ((n+2)/2 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2, and `end` is (n+2)/2 - 1.***
