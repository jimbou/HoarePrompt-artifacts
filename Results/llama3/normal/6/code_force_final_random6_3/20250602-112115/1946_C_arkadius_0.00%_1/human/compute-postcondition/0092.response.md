Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus two, `u` is the third child of `v`. The `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged with n vertices, and the values of s and x remain the same. The postorder and stack also remain unchanged. The vertex v still has at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus two, and u is still the third child of v. However, the good_components of tree.vertices[v] has been incremented by 1.
