The only variables in the loop head are variables  u and tree.vertices[v].children, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tree.vertices[v].children.  If the list has at least 2 children the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tree.vertices[v].children has at least 2 children, u is the first child of vertex v and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 children and the u is the second child of vertex v.
State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has two more elements than before which are tuples containing the children of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child of vertex `v` and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False**
