The only objects in the loop head are variables  u and tree.vertices[v].children, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tree.vertices[v].children.  If the list has at least 3 children the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tree.vertices[v].children has at least 2 children, u is the second child of tree.vertices[v]. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 children and the u is the third child of tree.vertices[v].
State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `tree.vertices[v]`.**
