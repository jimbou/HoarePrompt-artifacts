Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, and `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which is a tuple containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are two tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` has two tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, and the second child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` has three tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True`, the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, the second child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, and the third child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
