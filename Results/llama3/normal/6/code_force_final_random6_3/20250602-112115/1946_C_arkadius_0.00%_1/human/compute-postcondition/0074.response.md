Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` has three tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True`, the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, the second child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, and the third child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`.**

In this output state, the stack now contains three tuples, with the third child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False` added to the stack. The other variables remain unchanged.
