Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer. The current value of `postorder` is not empty. If `stack` is not empty, it has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the last child of `v`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop, `u` is the first child of `v`, and the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`. If the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by one. Otherwise, the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`, which is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus one, `u` is the second child of `v`. If the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by one plus the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`. Otherwise, the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`, and the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[v]` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`, which is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices that must have at least 1 vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is not empty, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and all children `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least as many children as the number of iterations of the loop plus two, `u` is the third child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
