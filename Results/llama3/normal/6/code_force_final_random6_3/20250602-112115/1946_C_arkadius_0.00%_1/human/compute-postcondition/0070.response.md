Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has one more element than before which are two tuples containing the popped value `v` and a boolean value `True` and the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`.**

In this output state, the stack now contains two tuples: one with the vertex `v` and a boolean value `True`, and another with the first child `u` of `v` and a boolean value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.
