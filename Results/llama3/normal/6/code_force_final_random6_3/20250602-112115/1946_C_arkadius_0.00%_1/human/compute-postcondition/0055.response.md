Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty but has one less element than before, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `tree.vertices[v]`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged with `n` vertices, and the values of `s` and `x` are still non-negative integers. The stack has one less element than before, and the popped values `v` and `postorder` are still valid. The children of `tree.vertices[v]` still have at least 2 children, and `u` is still the second child of `tree.vertices[v]`. The only change is that the `good_components` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by the value of `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`.
