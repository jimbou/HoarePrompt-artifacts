Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the popped value from the stack, `postorder` is the popped value from the stack, `stack` is not empty and has two more elements than before which are tuples containing the children of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the next child of vertex `v` and is now appended to the stack with a boolean value False**

In this output state, the code has appended the next child `u` of vertex `v` to the stack with a boolean value False. The stack now has two more elements than before, which are tuples containing the children of the popped value from the stack and a boolean value False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
