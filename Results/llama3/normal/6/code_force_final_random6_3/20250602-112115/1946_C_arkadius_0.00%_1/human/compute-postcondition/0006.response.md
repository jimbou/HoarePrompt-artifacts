Output State: **n is at least 4, i is 3, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes and three additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1, u and v are integers, input is empty**

The code first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. Since the input is empty, this operation does not change the state of the input. The second line adds an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` to the `tree` object. This operation modifies the `tree` object by adding a new edge. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` are not affected by the code.
