Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is a non-negative integer less than n, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of the vertex `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`**

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least 3 children is still valid, and `u` is still the third child of the vertex `v`. The values of `s`, `x`, `stack`, and `postorder` are unchanged.
