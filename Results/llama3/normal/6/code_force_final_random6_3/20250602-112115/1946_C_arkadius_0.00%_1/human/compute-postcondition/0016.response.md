Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3. `k` is a non-negative integer. If the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is (n+2)/2, `mid` is ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2, and `end` is ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2 - 1. Otherwise, `beg` is 1, `mid` is ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2, and `end` is ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2 - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the tree data structure and the value of k remain unchanged. The values of beg, mid, and end are updated based on the result of the function func_3. If the function returns True, then beg is set to (n+2)/2, mid is set to ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2, and end is set to ((n+2)/2 + n + 1) // 2 - 1. If the function returns False, then beg is set to 1, mid is set to ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2, and end is set to ((1 + (n+2)/2 - 1 + 1) // 2 - 1.
