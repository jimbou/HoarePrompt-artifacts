The code prints the string `s` rotated by half its length.
Since `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, the rotation will result in a new string where the second half of `s` is moved to the beginning and the first half is moved to the end.
Output: **newstr (where newstr is the string s rotated by half its length)**
