The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `s`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the last character of `s` plus 1, `a` contains all unique characters of `s`, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
