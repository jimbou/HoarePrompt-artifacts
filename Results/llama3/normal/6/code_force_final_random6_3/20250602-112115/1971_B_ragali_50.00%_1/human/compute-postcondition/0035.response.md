To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in s:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `s`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `s`, and `s` has a length of at least 1 and at most 10.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least one more character, and `i` must be the next character in `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the second character of `s`, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
