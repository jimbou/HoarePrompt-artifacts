Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, s is a string of length at least 1 consisting of lowercase English letters, i is the last character of s, a contains all unique characters of s and has more than one character, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, 'YES' is being printed. If the string formed by swapping the first and second halves of s is not equal to s, then the second half of the string s followed by the first half of the string s is being printed. If the string formed by swapping the first and second halves of s is equal to s, then if the string s spelled backwards is not equal to s, the string s spelled backwards is being printed. Otherwise, the string formed by concatenating the second half of s and the first half of s is being printed.***
