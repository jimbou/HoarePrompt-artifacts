To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the string `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Since `i` is the last character of `s` plus 1, we can adjust `i` to be the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length at least 1 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the first character of `s`, `a` is an empty set, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
