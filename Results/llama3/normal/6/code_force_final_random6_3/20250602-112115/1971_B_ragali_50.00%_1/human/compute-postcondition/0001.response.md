To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop counter, it should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
