Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of s plus 2, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, i is the last character of s plus 2, a is a set containing all characters of s, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of `s` plus 2, `s` is a string of length at least 1 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the first character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all characters of `s` and the first character of `s`, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of `s` plus 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the second character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all characters of `s`, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of `s` plus 2, `s` is a string of length at least 3 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the third character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all characters of `s` and the third character of `s`, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
