The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 3 characters and the `i` is the third character of `s`. Also, `a` must contain the first character of `s`, the second character of `s` and the third character of `s`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1 and stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length at least 3 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the third character of `s`, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`, the second character of `s` and the third character of `s`, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
