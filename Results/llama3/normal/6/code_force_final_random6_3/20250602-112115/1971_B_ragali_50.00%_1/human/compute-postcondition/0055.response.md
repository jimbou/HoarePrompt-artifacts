Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, i is the last character of s plus 1, a is a set containing all characters of s and has more than one unique character, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, newstr is a string formed by rotating s by half its length, isreverse is a string that is the reverse of s, and 'YES' is being printed. If newstr is not equal to s, the rotated string s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2] is being printed. If newstr is equal to s, and the reverse of s is not equal to s, the reverse of s is being printed. Otherwise, the second half of the string s plus the first half of the string s is being printed.**
