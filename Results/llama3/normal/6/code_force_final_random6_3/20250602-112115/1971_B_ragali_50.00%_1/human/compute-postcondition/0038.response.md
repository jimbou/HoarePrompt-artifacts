Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length at least 3 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the third character of `s`, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`, the second character of `s`, the third character of `s` and the third character of `s` (which is `i`), stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` remains a string of length at least 3 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` remains the third character of `s`, `a` is updated to be a set containing the first character of `s`, the second character of `s`, and the third character of `s` (which is `i`) twice (since `i` is already the third character of `s`), and stdin still contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
