To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first character of `s`, and `s` is a string of length at least 1 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least one more character. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `s` to be a string of length at least 2 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

Since `i` is the first character of `s`, we can adjust the state of `i` to be the second character of `s`.

The other variables, `t` and `a`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of `s` plus 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the second character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all characters of `s` and the first character of `s`, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
