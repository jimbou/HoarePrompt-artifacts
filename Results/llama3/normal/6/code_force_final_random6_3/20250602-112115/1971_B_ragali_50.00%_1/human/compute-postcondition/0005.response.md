According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `i` is the first character of `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 2 characters and `i` is the second character of `s`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is the second character of `s`, `s` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` contains the first character of `s`, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
