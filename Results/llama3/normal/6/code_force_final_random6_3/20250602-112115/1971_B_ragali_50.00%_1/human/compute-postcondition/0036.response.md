The code adds the second character of `s` to the set `a`. The second character of `s` is `i`. So, `a` now contains the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the second character of `s`, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
