Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of `s` plus 2, `s` is a string of length at least 3 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the third character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all characters of `s` and the third character of `s`, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `s` remains the same string, `i` remains the same character, and `a` now contains all characters of `s` plus the third character of `s` (which was already in `s`, so `a` doesn't change much). The stdin still contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
