Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than the last character of `s` plus 2, `s` is a string of length at least 1 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is the first character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all characters of `s` and the first character of `s`, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, and it is still greater than the last character of `s` plus 2. `s` is still a string of length at least 1 and at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. `i` is still the first character of `s`. `a` is a set that now contains all characters of `s` and the first character of `s` (which was already in `s`). The stdin still contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
