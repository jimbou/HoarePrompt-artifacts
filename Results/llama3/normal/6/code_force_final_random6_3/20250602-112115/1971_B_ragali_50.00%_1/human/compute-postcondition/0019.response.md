The code prints the string `isreverse` which is equal to `s` spelled backwards. Since `s` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of lowercase English letters, `isreverse` will also be a string of the same length consisting of lowercase English letters, but in reverse order.

Output: **s spelled backwards**
