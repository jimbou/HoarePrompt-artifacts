The first line assigns the values of the next three space-separated integers from stdin to `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since stdin contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, it now contains `t-4` sets. The second line assigns the value of 1 to `s`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is 1, stdin contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, _ is 2, i is x - 1**
