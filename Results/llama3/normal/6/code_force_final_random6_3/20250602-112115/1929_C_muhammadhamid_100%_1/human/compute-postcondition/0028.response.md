According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is 2**
