Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee winning any number of coins, and then checks if the initial amount of coins is sufficient.

The calculation of the minimum amount of coins is done by simulating the worst-case scenario, where Sasha loses x times in a row. In each loss, he needs to have enough coins to place a bet that will cover the loss and still have some coins left. The program calculates this amount by iteratively adding the minimum bet amount (s // (k - 1) + 1) to the total amount (s).

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum amount (s). If it is, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
