Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2, `stdin` contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, `_` is 1, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 2, as it is incremented by the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. The other variables remain unchanged.
