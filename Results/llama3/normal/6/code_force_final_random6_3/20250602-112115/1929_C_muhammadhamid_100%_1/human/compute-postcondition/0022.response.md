To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an iterator variable that takes on the values in the range generated by `int(input())`.

According to the current state, `_` is 1, which means that the loop has already executed once. To execute again, `_` needs to be incremented to 2.

The other variables in the state, such as `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, `stdin`, `i`, and the printed output, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `_` to 2.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least `x` * (`k` - 1) + `x` + 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is `x` - 1**
