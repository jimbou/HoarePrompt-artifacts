The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 1. So for the loop to be executed `x` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 1, `i` is 0**
