Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is 1, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 1, i is -1**

In this output state, the values of k, x, and a are updated based on the input from stdin. The value of s is reset to 1. The value of i is updated to -1. The value of _ remains unchanged at 1. Stdin now contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a.
