The code prints 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The value of `s` is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to `s + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`. The value of `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The value of `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value of `k` is an integer between 2 and 30.

Output: **Yes if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise No (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and s is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to s + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1))**
