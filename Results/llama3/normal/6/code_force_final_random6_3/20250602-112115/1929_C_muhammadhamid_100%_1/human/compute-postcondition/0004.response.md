To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(x):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**
