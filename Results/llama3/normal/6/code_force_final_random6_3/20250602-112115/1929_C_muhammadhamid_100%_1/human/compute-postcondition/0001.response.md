Output State: **stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 0, k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is 1**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three space-separated integers k, x, and a. These values are assigned to the variables k, x, and a, respectively. The variable s is initialized to 1. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. Since t is decremented by 1 after reading the first set of integers, there are now t-1 sets of integers left in stdin.
