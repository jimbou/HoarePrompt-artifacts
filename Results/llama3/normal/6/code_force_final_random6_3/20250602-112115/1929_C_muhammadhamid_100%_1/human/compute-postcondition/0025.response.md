Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be greater than 1, as it was initially 1 and has been incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers.
