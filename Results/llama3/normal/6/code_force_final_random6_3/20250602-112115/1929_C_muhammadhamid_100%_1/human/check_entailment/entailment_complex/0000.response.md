Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for `k`, `x`, and `a` from the standard input.
2.  It initializes the variable `s` to 1, which represents the minimum amount Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win.
3.  The program then calculates the value of `s` based on the given formula: `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula is derived from the fact that Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses (`x`) and still have enough coins to make a bet that will guarantee a win.
4.  The program correctly prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win, and 'No' otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
