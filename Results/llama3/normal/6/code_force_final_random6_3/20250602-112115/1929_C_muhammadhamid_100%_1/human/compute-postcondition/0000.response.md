The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
