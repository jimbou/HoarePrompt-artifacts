Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now a combination of its original value and the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1`, which depends on the value of `k`.
