Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is 2**

The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value, which was already equal to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. This means that `s` is now equal to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, which is a new value that is greater than the previous value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
