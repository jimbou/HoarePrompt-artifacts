Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2**

The code increments the value of `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. The value of `s` is now a more complex expression involving `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
