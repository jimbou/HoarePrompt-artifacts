Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
