Output State: **stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 0, k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is s + x * (s // (k - 1) + 1), i is x - 1**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:

*   `stdin` still contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
*   `_` remains 0.
*   `k` is still an integer between 2 and 30.
*   `x` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times.
*   `a` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9.
*   `s` has been updated `x` times, with each update adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`. The final value of `s` is `s + x * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`.
*   `i` has been incremented to `x - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times.
