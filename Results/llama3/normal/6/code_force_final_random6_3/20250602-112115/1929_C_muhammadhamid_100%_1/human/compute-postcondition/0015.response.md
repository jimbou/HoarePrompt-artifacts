The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2, `stdin` contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, `_` is 1, `i` is 1**
