To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is 1**
