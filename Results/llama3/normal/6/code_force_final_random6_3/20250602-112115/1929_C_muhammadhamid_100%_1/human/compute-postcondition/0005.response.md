Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. The value of `_` is still 0, and the values of `x` and `a` are still within their respective ranges. The value of `i` is still 1.
