The code prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'No'. Where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is s + x * (s // (k - 1) + 1), k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, and _ is 0.
Output: **stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 0, k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is s + x * (s // (k - 1) + 1), i is x - 1, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s**
