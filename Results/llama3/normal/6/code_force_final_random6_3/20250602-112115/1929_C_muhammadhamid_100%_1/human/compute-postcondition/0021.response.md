The code prints 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. Where `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` is at least `x * (k - 1) + x + 1`, and `x` is 0, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 30.
Output: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is at least x * (k - 1) + x + 1, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, and this is printed: 'Yes' if a >= s else 'No'**
