Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to `s + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is `x - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* `k` remains an integer between 2 and 30.
* `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop may have executed zero or more times.
* `a` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9.
* `s` is an integer greater than 1 and has been updated `x - 1` times according to the formula `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The final value of `s` depends on the initial value of `s`, `k`, and the number of iterations `x`.
* `stdin` still contains `t-4` sets of three space-separated integers.
* `_` remains 2.
* `i` is now `x - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times.
