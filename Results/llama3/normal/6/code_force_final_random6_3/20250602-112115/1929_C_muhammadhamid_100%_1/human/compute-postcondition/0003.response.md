Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. The value of `s` is now dependent on the value of `k`, which is an integer between 2 and 30.
