The code prints 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. Here, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` is at least `x * (k - 1) + x + 1`. Since the exact values of `a`, `x`, and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical comparison. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'No' otherwise.

Output: **Yes if a is greater than or equal to s, No otherwise (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and s is at least x * (k - 1) + x + 1)**
