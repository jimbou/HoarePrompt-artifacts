Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The key insight is that Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants if he can recover from a sequence of losses. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to recover from x consecutive losses, and then checks if he has at least that amount.

The calculation of the minimum amount of coins is done using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, which is derived from the fact that Sasha needs to bet `s // (k - 1) + 1` coins to recover from a loss, and then he needs to add 1 to account for the next bet.

The program then checks if Sasha has at least the calculated amount of coins, and prints "Yes" if he does, and "No" otherwise.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and all the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
