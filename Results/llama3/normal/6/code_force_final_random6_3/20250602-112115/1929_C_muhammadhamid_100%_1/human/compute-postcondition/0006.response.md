To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `x` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `stdin`, `_`, `k`, `a`, and `s`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, `_` is 0, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2**
