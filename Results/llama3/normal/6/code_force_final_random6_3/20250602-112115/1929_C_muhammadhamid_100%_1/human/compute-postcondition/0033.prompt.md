Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 0, k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is s + x * (s // (k - 1) + 1), i is x - 1, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is at least x * (k - 1) + x + 1, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, and this is printed: 'Yes' if a >= s else 'No'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to `s + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`, `stdin` contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers, `_` is 2, `i` is `x - 1`, and 'Yes' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` otherwise 'No' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
