To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Since `_` is initialized to 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `int(input())` is `t`. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Therefore, we can increment `_` by 1, making it 1.

The other variables in the state, such as `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, and `i`, are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`stdin` contains t-2 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 1, k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is s + x * (s // (k - 1) + 1), i is x - 1, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s**
