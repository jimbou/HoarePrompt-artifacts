Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is an integer greater than 1 and is equal to s + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), stdin is empty, _ is t-1, i is x - 1, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s otherwise 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input buffer (stdin) will be empty because all the input sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a have been processed. The loop counter `_` will be equal to `t-1`, where `t` is the initial number of sets of integers provided as input. The variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`, where `x` is the last value of `x` read from the input. The variable `s` will have a value greater than 1 and will be equal to the sum of the last value of `s` and `(x-1)` times the integer division of `s` by `(k-1)` plus 1. Finally, the program will print 'Yes' if the last value of `a` is greater than or equal to the last value of `s`, otherwise it will print 'No'.
