Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 2 binary digits, `c` is the second binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, stdin is empty**

The code increments the value of `cnt[c]` by 1. The value of `c` can be either 0 or 1 since it is a binary digit. If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin remains empty.
