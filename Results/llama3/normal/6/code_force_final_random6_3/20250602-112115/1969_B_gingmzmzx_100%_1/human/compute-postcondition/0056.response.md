Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 1 more than before if `c` is the second integer in the list `s` and equals to 1, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` depending on the value of `cnt[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise, it remains the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
