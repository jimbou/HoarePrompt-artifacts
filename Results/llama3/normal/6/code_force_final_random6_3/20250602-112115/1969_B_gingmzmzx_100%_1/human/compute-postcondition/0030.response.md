Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing one zero and one value greater than zero, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the first integer in the list `s` and `c` is not equal to 0**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the first element of the list `cnt` (which is zero) to its previous value (which was 0). The values of the other variables are not affected.
