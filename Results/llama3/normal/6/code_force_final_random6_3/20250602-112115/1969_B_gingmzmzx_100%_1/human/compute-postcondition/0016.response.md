Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 3 binary digits, `c` is the third binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `cnt[0]` is greater than `cnt[1]`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the value of `cnt[c]` incremented by 1. This means that if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, and if `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
