Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing one zero and one value greater than zero, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty. If the first integer `c` in the list `s` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt[c]` has been increased by 1, where `c` is the first integer in the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `c` and the updated value of `cnt[c]`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
