Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing one zero and one value greater than zero, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is either `ans` + 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1 if the count of 1 in the list `cnt` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
