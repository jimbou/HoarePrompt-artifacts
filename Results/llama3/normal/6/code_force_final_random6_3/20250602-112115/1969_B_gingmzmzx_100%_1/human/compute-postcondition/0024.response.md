Output State: **n is greater than 1, _ is 1, s is a list of integers, zeroes is the number of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list containing two zeroes, ans is 0, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the variable `s` now contains a list of integers read from the input, and the variable `zeroes` contains the count of zeroes in this list. The variable `cnt` is initialized to a list containing two zeroes, and the variable `ans` is set to 0. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, and the value of `_` remains 1. The stdin is empty as all the input has been read.
