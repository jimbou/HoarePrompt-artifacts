Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 1 binary digit, `c` is the first binary digit in the list and is 1, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the first value in the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
