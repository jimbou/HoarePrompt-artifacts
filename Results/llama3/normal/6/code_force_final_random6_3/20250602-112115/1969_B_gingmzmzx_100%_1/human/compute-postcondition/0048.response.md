Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 0, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[c]` has been incremented by 1, which means the count of the first integer `c` in the list `s` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
