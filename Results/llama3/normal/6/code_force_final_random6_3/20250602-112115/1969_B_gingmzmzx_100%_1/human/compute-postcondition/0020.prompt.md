Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 0, _ is 0, s is a list of binary digits, zeroes is the number of zeroes in s, cnt is a list containing two zeroes, ans is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 1 binary digit, `c` is the first binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `stdin` is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 2 binary digits, `c` is the second binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `cnt[0]` is greater than `cnt[1]`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 3 binary digits, `c` is the third binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `cnt[0]` is greater than `cnt[1]`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, stdin is empty, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise it remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
