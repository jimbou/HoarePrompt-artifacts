Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 1 more than before if `c` is the second integer in the list `s` and equals to 1, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])` depending on the value of `c`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its previous value. The previous value of `ans` was either 0 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is 1, then `ans` is now `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])`, otherwise, it remains `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
