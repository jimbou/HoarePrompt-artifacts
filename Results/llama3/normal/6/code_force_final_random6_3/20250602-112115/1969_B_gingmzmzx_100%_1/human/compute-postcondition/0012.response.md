Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 2 binary digits, `c` is the second binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, the value of `_` is still 0, the list `s` still contains at least 2 binary digits, `c` is still the second binary digit in the list, the number of zeroes in `s` is still stored in `zeroes`, the list `cnt` still contains two values, one of which is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise it is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise it is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The stdin is still empty.
