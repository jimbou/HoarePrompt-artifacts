Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 3 binary digits, `c` is the third binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, and the value of `_` is still 0. The list `s` still contains at least 3 binary digits, and `c` is still the third binary digit in the list. The number of zeroes in `s` is still stored in `zeroes`. The list `cnt` still contains two values, but one of them has been incremented by 1. The value of `ans` has been updated based on the previous values of `c`, `zeroes`, and `cnt`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is now `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is now `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`. The value of `cnt[c]` has been incremented by 1. The stdin is still empty.
