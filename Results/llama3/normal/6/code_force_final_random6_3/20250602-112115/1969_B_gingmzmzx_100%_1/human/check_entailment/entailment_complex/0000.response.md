Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program reads a positive integer 'n' from standard input, followed by 'n' binary strings. For each binary string, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the minimum total cost is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent 0s and 1s in the binary string. This is because each cyclic shift operation can reduce the number of such pairs by at most 1.

The program uses a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s in the binary string. It then iterates through the binary string, updating the count of 0s and 1s and calculating the minimum total cost.

The program's output is correct because it accurately calculates the minimum total cost for each binary string. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
