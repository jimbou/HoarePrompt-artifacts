Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

The issue with the program is that it is not considering the case where a single operation can sort the entire string. In the case of "101", a single operation of cyclically shifting the substring "101" to "011" will sort the string, resulting in a cost of 1, not 2.

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle such cases.
