The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `c` is not defined, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the original list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing the number of zeroes and ones in the original list `s`, `ans` is the number of zeroes in the original list `s` that are not followed by a one, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeroes in the original list `s` that are not followed by a one which is `ans` is being printed**
