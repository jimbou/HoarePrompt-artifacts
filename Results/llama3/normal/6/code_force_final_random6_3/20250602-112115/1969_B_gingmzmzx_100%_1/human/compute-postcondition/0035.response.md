Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing one zero and one value greater than zero, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty. If the first integer `c` in the list `s` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `ans` has been updated. If the first integer `c` in the list `s` is 0, then `ans` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` and `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
