Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 2, _ is 2, s is a list of integers, zeroes is the number of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list containing two zeroes, ans is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the first integer `c` in the list `s` is 0, then `ans` is 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 1 more than before if `c` is the second integer in the list `s` and equals to 1, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])` depending on the value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 1 more than before if `c` is the second integer in the list `s` and equals to 1, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 2 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])` depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is not 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1, `ans` is either 3 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) or 2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) depending on the value of `c`. `cnt[c]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
