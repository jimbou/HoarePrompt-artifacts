To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for c in s:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `c` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, and `c` is the second integer in the list `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 integers, and `c` must be the third integer in the list `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 1 more than before if `c` is the second integer in the list `s` and equals to 1, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])` depending on the value of `c`.**
