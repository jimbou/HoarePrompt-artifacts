The code prints the value of `ans` which is calculated based on the number of zeroes and non-zero integers in the list `s`. Since `s` is an empty list, the number of zeroes (`zeroes`) is 0, and the number of non-zero integers is also 0.

The formula for `ans` is: `ans = (number of non-zero integers in s) * zeroes - zeroes + (number of non-zero integers in s that are equal to 1)`. 

Since `s` is empty, the number of non-zero integers is 0, and there are no integers equal to 1. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as: `ans = 0 * 0 - 0 + 0 = 0`.

Output: **0**
