The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains one input: a binary string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s.**
