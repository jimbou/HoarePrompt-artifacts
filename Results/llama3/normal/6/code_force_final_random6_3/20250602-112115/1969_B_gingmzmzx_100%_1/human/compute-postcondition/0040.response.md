The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` increments the value of `ans` by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Since `cnt[0]` is a list containing one zero and one value greater than zero, `cnt[0]` is equal to 0. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing one zero and one value greater than zero, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]` if the second integer `c` in the list `s` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same, `stdin` is empty.**
