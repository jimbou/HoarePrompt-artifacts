Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 3 binary digits, `c` is the third binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `cnt[0]` is greater than `cnt[1]`, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, stdin is empty, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise it remains the same.**
