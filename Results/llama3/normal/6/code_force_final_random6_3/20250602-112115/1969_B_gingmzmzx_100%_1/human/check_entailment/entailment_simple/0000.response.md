Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

The program works by iterating over the binary string and maintaining a count of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far. It also maintains a count of the number of 0s in the entire string.

For each character in the string, if it is 0, the program increments the answer by 1 if there are any 1s encountered before it. This is because a 0 can be shifted to the left of a 1 by performing a cyclic shift operation on the substring ending at the current position.

If the character is 1, the program increments the answer by the number of 0s remaining in the string minus the number of 0s encountered so far. This is because a 1 can be shifted to the right of all the remaining 0s by performing a cyclic shift operation on the substring starting from the current position.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, in which case the answer is 0.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
