The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[c]` by 1. Since `c` is the first binary digit in the list `s`, it can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the value of `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1, regardless of whether `c` is 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 1 binary digit, `c` is the first binary digit in the list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, where `c` is the first binary digit in the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
