Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. 

The program works by iterating over the binary string and maintaining a count of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far. For each character, it calculates the cost of making the string sorted up to that point. If the character is 0, the cost is 1 if there is at least one 1 to its left, otherwise the cost is 0. If the character is 1, the cost is the number of 0s to its right. The total cost is the sum of these costs.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, in which case the cost is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the string needs to be cyclically shifted, in which case the cost is the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, and the space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counts of 0s and 1s.

Correctness: **True**
