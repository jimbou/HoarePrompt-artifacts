Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of binary digits that must have at least 1 binary digit, `c` is the first binary digit in the list and equals 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in s, `cnt` is a list containing two values, one of which is incremented by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1, making it 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
