Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: a binary string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, _ is 0, s is an empty list, c is not defined, zeroes is the number of zeroes in the original list s, cnt is a list containing the number of zeroes and ones in the original list s, ans is the number of zeroes in the original list s that are not followed by a one, stdin is empty, and the number of zeroes in the original list s that are not followed by a one which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing the count of zeroes and non-zeroes in the list `s`, `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero integer in `s` plus the number of zeroes in `s` that have a corresponding non-zero integer, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `ans` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is equal to `zeroes` and the second integer is equal to the number of non-zero integers in `s`, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is equal to the number of non-zero integers in `s` times `zeroes` minus the number of zeroes in `s` plus the number of non-zero integers in `s` that are equal to 1, and ans which is equal to 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
