Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 1 more than before if `c` is the second integer in the list `s` and equals to 1, `stdin` is empty, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) or 2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) - 1 depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is either 3 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) or 2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) depending on the value of `c`. `cnt[c]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its previous value. The value of `cnt[c]` has also been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
