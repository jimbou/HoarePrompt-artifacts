Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is 1 more than before and the second integer is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the first integer `c` in the list `s` is 0, then `ans` is 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.***
