The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, it is removed. The length of `a` is now `i - 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and `res` is 0.**
