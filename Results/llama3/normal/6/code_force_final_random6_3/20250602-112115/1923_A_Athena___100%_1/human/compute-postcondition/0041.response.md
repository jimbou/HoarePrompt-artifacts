To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that it still meets the condition `a and a[-1] == 0`.

Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers and the second last element must be 0, we can adjust the state of `a` by adding one more element to the end of the list, which is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, the second last element must be 0, and the last element must be 0, `res` is 0**
