Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, n is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, i is equal to the length of a, and res is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' will be left with no trailing zeros, and the variable 'i' will be equal to the length of the updated list 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged.
