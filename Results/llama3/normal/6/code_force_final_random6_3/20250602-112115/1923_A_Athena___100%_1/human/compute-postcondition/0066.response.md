Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the last element is not 0, and the first element is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, and `res` is 0**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element was 0, the new first element is 1. The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
