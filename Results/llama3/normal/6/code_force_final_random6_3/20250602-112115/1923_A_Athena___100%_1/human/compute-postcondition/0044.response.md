Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the second last element must be 0, `res` is 0, and the last element of `a` is removed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `stdin` still contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50, and `res` is still 0. The list `a` is modified by removing its last element, but it still meets the conditions of being non-empty, having at least one element equal to 1, starting with 1, and having the second last element equal to 0.
