The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a[-1]` is 0, the last element removed is 0. The list `a` is now one element shorter, and the last element is no longer 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0, `res` is 0**
