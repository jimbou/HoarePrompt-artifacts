Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1 and `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 3, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is either 2 or 3. If `a[i-1]` is 0, `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 2. If `a[i]` is 1, the state of `res` remains unchanged.***
