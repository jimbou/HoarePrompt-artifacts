Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, n is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0, res is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` is reduced by 2 lines as two lines are read from `stdin` by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 50, as it is assigned the value of the first line read from `stdin`. The value of `a` is updated to a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0, as it is assigned the value of the second line read from `stdin`. The value of `res` is set to 0, as it is assigned the value of 0 by the code.
