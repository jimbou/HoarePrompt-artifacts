The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The size of the list `a` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of n-1 integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, `res` is 0**
