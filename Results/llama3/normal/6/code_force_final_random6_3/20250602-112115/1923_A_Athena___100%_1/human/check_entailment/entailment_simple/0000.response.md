Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of cells, and the state of each cell as input.

The program first removes any leading or trailing zeros from the list of cells, as these do not affect the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Then, it iterates through the remaining cells and counts the number of zeros, which represent the free cells that need to be moved to form a single block. This count is stored in the variable `res`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `res`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly removes leading and trailing zeros, counts the number of zeros in the remaining cells, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
