Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is not 0, and the last element is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and `res` is 0.**

The code removes the first element from the list `a`, which was initially 0. As a result, the first element of `a` is no longer 0, but the last element is still not 0. The length of `a` has decreased by 1, so `i` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
