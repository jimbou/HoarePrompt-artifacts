To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is equal to the length of `a`, we can adjust `i` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, `i` is at least 1, and `res` is 0**
