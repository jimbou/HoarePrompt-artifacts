Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0 and `a` has at least 2 elements. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0. The number of lines in `stdin` remains the same, 2t-2 lines. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, an integer between 2 and 50. The list `a` remains the same, a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0 and `a` has at least 2 elements. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is now 2 and `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is not 0, then `res` is increased by 1.
