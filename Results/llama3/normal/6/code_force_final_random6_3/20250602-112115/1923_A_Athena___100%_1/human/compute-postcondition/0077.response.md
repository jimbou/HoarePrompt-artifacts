Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0, `i` is at least 1, `res` is 1, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines, and the properties of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` are unchanged.
