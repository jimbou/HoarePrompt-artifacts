Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of n-3 integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, `res` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of lines in `stdin` also remains the same, 2t-2. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 50. The list `a` has been modified by removing the first element, so it now contains n-3 integers, and since at least one of the original elements was 1, at least one of the remaining elements is also 1. The value of `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code.
