Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, and `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `res` is either 2 or the previous value of `res` incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is either 2 or the previous value of `res` incremented by 1, because the code increments `res` by 1 regardless of the current value of `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
