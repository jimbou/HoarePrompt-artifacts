Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, the second last element is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, and `res` is 0**

The value of `a` has been changed by the code. The `pop()` function removes the last element from the list `a`, which was 0. The length of `a` is now reduced by 1, so `i` is still equal to the length of `a` minus 2. The other variables are not affected by the code.
