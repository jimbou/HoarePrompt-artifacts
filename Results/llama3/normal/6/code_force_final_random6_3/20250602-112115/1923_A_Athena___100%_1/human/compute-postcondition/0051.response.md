Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, and `a` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `res` is either 1 or 2 depending on the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is either 1 or 2, depending on the current value of `a[i]`. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
