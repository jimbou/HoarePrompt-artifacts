Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same conditions for `t`, `stdin`, `n`, and `a` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `a`. The variable `res` will be equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`, because the loop increments `res` by 1 each time it encounters a zero in `a`.
