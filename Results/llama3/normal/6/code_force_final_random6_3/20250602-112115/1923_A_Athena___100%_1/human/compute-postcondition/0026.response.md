Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0 and `a` has at least 3 elements. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 3 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.***
