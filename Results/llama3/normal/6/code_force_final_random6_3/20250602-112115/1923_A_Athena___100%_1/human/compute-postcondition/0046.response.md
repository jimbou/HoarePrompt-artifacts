To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is already a non-empty list, we can adjust the state to ensure that `a` has at least one element and `i` is 0 (the starting index of the range).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, and `a` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `res` is 0**
