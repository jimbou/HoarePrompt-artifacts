Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `n`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The list `a` will remain unchanged, with at least one element being 1 and the first element being 1. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a`. The variable `res` will be equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`.
