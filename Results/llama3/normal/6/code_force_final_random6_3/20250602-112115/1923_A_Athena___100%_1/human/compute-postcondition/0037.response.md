Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the last element is not 0, and the first element is 1, and `res` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by removing the first element, which was 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` now starts with 1, and all other conditions on `a` are still valid.
