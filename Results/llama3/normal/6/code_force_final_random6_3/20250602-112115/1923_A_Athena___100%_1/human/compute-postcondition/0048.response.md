Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, and `a` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `res` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least one element, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0. The current index `i` is still 0, and the value of `a[i]` is still 0. The input `stdin` still contains 2t - 2 lines.
