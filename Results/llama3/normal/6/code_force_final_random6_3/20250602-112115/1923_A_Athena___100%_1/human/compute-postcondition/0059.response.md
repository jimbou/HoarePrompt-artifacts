The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `_` is equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed**
