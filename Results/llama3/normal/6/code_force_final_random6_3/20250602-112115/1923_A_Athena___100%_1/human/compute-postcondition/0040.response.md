Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the second last element must be 0, `res` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, and `res` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `a` is still non-empty and contains integers between 0 and 1, with at least one 1. The first element is still 1, but the last element is now the second last element, which is 0. This is because the `pop()` function removes the last element from the list.
