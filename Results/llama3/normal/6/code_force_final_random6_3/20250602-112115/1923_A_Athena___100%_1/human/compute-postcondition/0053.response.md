The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, and `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `res` is not changed.**
