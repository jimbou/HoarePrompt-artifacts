Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, and the last element is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, and `res` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by removing the first element (which was 0) from the list. The value of `i` has also been updated to be equal to the length of the updated list `a` minus 1, which is now `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
