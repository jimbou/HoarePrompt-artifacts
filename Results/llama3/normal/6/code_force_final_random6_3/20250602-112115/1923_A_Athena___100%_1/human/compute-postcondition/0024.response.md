The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0 and `a` has at least 3 elements. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.**
