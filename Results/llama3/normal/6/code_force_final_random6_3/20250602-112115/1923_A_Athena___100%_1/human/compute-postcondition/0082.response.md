The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least `i+1` elements. So `i` is at least 3 and `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1 and `a` has at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1 and `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 3, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i-1]` is 0, `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1. If `a[i]` is 1, the state of `res` remains unchanged.**
