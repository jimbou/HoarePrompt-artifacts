The code prints the value of `res`, which is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers where at least one element is 1 and the last element is not 0, the number of zeros in `a` will be less than the total number of elements in `a`.

Output: **the number of zeros in the list a**
