The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, it is removed from the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0, `res` is 0**
