Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It first removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`, which represents the cells with chips (1) and free cells (0). Then, it counts the number of zeros in the remaining list, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When all chips are already in a single block (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
* When there are free cells between chips (e.g., [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
* When there are leading or trailing free cells (e.g., [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
* When there are multiple blocks of chips separated by free cells (e.g., [1, 0, 1, 0, 1])

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all possible input cases.
