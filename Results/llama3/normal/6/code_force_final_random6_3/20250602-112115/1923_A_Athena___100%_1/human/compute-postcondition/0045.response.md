Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, n is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, res is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, leaving at least one 1 in the list, and the first element is 1. The last element of `a` will not be 0. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
