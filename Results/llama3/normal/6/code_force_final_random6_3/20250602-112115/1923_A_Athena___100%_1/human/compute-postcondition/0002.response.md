Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains 2t-2 lines, n is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, res is 0.**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 50, `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 50. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. Since `a` contains at least one 1, `a` becomes a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1. The third line assigns 0 to `res`. Since `res` is not modified by any other line, `res` remains 0. The value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0. Stdin initially contains 2t lines, but two lines are consumed by the first two lines of the code, so stdin now contains 2t-2 lines.
