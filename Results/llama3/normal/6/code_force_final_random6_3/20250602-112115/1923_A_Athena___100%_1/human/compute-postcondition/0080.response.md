Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, `i` is at least 2, `res` is either 1 or 2, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If `a[i-1]` is 0, `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated based on its previous value and the condition `a[i-1]`. If `a[i-1]` is 0, `res` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
