Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, following the specified format. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the list `n` and the list of integers `a`.
2.  The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using the `pop(0)` and `pop()` methods. This is correct because the problem statement allows for the removal of leading and trailing zeros.
3.  The program then counts the remaining zeros in the list `a` by iterating over the list and incrementing the count `res` whenever it encounters a zero. This is correct because the problem statement defines the minimum number of operations as the number of zeros between the chips.
4.  Finally, the program prints the count of remaining zeros `res` for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Correctness: **True**
