Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the last element is not 0, and the first element is 1, `res` is 0**

The code removes the first element from the list `a`, which was 0. The list `a` now starts with 1, and all other conditions for `a` remain the same. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 lines.
