The only variable in the loop head is variable a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable a.  If a is not empty and a[0] is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a is a list of n-1 integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, a must not be empty and a[0] must be 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of n-1 integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, a is not empty and a[0] is 0, `res` is 0**
