Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, n is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the last element is not 0, the first element is 1, and res is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables in the initial state remain unchanged except for list a. List a will have all leading zeros removed, and the first element will be 1.
