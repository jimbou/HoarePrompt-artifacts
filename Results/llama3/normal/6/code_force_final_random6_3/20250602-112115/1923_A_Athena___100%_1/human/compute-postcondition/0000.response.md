Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t lines. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The remaining input lines are still present in the stdin, with each block of two lines containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as specified in the initial state.
