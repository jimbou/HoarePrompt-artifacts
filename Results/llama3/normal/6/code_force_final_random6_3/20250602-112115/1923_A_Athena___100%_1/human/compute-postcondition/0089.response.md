Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of zeros in each list of integers. It expects the input to start with an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t blocks of two lines. Each block contains an integer n, representing the length of the list, and a list of n integers (0s and 1s) where at least one integer is 1. The function removes leading and trailing zeros from each list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints this count for each list. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving stdin empty.**
