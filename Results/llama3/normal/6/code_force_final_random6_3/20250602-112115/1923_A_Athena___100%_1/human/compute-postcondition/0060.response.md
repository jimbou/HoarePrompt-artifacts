Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, n is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0, i is equal to the length of a, and res is 0.**

The code reads two lines from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `a`. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 50, and `a` is a list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, and the last element is not 0. The length of `a` is still equal to `i`, but the value of `res` is now 0, as it has been reset by the code. The number of zeros in `a` is no longer being printed.
