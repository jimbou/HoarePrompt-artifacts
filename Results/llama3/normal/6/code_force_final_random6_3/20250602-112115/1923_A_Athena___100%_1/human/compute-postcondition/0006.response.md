Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of n-2 integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, `res` is 0, and a is not empty.**

The code removes the first element from the list `a`, which was initially 0. The size of the list `a` is now reduced by 1, and it contains `n-2` integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
