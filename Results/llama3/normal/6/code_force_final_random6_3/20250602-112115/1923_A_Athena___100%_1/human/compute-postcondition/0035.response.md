The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, it is removed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the last element is not 0, and the first element is 1, `res` is 0**
