The variables in the loop head are a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable a.  If a is not empty and the last element of a is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, the second last element is 1, and i is equal to the length of a minus 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, the last element of a must be 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, the second last element is 1, the last element is 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, and `res` is 0**
