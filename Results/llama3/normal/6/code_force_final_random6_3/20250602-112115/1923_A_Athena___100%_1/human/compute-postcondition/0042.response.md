Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is 1, the second last element must be 0, and the last element is removed, `res` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1, `stdin` still contains 2t - 2 lines, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1, the first element is still 1, the second last element must be 0, but the last element (which was 0) is removed, and `res` remains 0.
