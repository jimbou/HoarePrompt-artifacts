Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum number of operations required to achieve this goal.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the ribbon (n) and the list of cells (a). It then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints this count as the minimum number of operations required.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. By removing leading and trailing zeros, it effectively moves the chips to the leftmost and rightmost possible positions, respectively. The remaining zeros in the list represent the free cells that need to be filled to form a single block, and the count of these zeros is the minimum number of operations required.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
