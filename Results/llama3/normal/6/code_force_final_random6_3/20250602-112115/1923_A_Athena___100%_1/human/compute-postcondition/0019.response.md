Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0, `res` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

The code increments the value of `res` by 1. The initial value of `res` was 0, so after the increment, `res` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` still contains 2t-2 lines, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1 and the last element is not 0, `i` is still 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is still 0.
