To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 1000, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains 2t lines. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1.**
