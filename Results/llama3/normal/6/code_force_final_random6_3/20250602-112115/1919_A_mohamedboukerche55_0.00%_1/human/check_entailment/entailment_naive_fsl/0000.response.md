Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins. The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets and printing the corresponding winner.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and prints the winner of the game.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
