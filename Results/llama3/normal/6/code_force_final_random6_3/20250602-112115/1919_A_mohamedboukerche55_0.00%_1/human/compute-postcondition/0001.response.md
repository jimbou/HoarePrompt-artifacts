The code reads an integer `t` from stdin, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. It then assigns the first integer `a` and the second integer `b` to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively.

Output State: **i is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers.**
