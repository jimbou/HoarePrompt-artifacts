Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The key observation is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which occurs when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because when the sum is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves an odd number of coins, allowing Bob to make the last move. Conversely, when the sum is odd, Bob will always be forced to make a move that leaves an even number of coins, allowing Alice to make the last move.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the coins in each wallet, and printing the winner of each game.

Correctness: **True**
