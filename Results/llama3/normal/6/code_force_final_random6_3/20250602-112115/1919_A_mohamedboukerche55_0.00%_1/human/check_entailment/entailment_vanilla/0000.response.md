Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make the last valid move. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets or keep the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The key observation here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the total number of coins in both wallets. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then calculates the total number of coins and checks if it's even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the total is even, it prints "bob", and if it's odd, it prints "alice".

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `s` is assigned the input string, but then the program uses `list(s.split())` to split the string into a list of integers. This is unnecessary, as the `split()` method already returns a list of strings, which can be converted to integers directly. A more efficient way to write this line would be `a, b = map(int, input().split())`.

Despite this minor issue, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
