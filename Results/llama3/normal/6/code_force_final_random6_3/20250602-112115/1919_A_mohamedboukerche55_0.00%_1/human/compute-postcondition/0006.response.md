Output State: **i is t-1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains 0 lines.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the initial number of test cases `t`, the variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input, and the standard input `stdin` will be empty, containing no more lines.
