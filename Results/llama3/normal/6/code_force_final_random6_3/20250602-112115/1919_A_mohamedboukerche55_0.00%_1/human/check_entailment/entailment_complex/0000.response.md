Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move. The solution provided uses the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets to determine the winner.

The key insight is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game is symmetric, and the players will always end up with the same parity of coins in their wallets.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the input pairs of integers, calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets, and checks the parity of the sum. If the sum is even, it prints "bob", and if it is odd, it prints "alice".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
