Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples of the game's progression and the expected output.

The given program reads pairs of integers from standard input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then calculates the sum of these integers and checks if it is even or odd. Based on this, it prints 'bob' if the sum is even and 'alice' if the sum is odd.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win. This is because the players alternate turns, and the player who removes the last coin loses. By exchanging wallets, a player can change the parity of their coin count, but the total parity remains the same.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
