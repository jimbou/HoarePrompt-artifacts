To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `stdin` must contain at least one more line with two integers.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2
* `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers

The states of `a` and `b` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers**
