Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either 0, 1, or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, or 0 if no such subarray exists
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If all elements in `arr` are equal, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a positive integer n and a sequence of n positive integers from standard input, and prints the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to the first element of the sequence. If all elements in the sequence are equal, it prints -1.
