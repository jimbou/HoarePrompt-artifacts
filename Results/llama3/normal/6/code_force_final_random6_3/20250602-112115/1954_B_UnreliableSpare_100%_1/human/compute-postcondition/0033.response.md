The `print(ans)` statement will print the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

Since `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, the value of `ans` will be the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

Output: **the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, or 0 if no such subarray exists**
