Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**.

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns a positive integer value to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` positive integers to `arr`. The variable `flag` is set to `True`. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that two lines have been read for each test case, leaving multiple test cases minus 2 lines in stdin.
