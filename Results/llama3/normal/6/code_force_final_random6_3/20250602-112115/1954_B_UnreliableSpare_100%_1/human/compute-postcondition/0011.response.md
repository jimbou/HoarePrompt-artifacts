Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `i` will be one less than the total number of elements in the list `arr`. The value of `flag` will be `True` if all elements in the list `arr` are equal, and `False` otherwise. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, and the state of `stdin` remains the same as in the initial state.
