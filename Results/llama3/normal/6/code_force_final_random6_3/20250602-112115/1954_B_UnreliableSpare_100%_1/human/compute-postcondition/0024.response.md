Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either Infinity or 0, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 2 or 3. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is Infinity. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now either 2 or 3, depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val` or not. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is Infinity. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is 0. The rest of the variables, including `n`, `i`, `arr`, `flag`, `stdin`, `val`, and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `val`, remain the same as in the initial state.
