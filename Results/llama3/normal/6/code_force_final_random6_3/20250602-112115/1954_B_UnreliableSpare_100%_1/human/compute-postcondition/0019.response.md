To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either Infinity or 0, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is Infinity. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val.**
