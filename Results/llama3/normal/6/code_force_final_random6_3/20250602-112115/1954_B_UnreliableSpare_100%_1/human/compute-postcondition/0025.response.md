Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, ans is either 0 or 1, val is the first element of arr, and cnt is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` was either 1 or 2, `ans` is now either 0 or 1. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
