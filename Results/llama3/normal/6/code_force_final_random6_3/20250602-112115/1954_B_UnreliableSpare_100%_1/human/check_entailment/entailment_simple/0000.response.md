Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, as it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. If the elements are not all equal, the program initializes a variable `ans` to infinity and `val` to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive elements equal to `val`. Whenever it encounters an element not equal to `val`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` seen so far.

3. After iterating through the entire array, the program updates `ans` one more time to be the minimum of its current value and the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` ending at the last index of the array.

4. Finally, the program prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful.

The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are equal, and it correctly finds the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful in all other cases.

Correctness: **True**
