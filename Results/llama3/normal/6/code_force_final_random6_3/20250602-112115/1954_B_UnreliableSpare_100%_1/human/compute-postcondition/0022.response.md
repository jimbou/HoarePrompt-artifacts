Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either Infinity or 0, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is Infinity. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val` and `cnt` is 0, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.***
