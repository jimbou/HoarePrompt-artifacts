You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one input: a positive integer n. The second line contains n inputs: a sequence of positive integers.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either 0, 1, or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, or 0 if no such subarray exists
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If all elements in `arr` are equal, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The current value of `flag` is True, indicating that all elements in `arr` are equal, and -1 is printed

Case_2: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Not all elements in `arr` are equal, and the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
