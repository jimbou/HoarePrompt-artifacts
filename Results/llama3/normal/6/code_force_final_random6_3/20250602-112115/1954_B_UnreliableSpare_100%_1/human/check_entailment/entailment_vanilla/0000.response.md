Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program works as follows:

1. It first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
3. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.
4. If the elements are not all the same, it initializes a variable `ans` to infinity and a variable `cnt` to 0. It also sets a variable `val` to the first element of the array.
5. It then iterates over the array. If the current element is equal to `val`, it increments `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `val`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
6. After the loop, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
7. Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues:

* The program uses the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module, but it's not necessary in this case. The `min` function can handle integer values just fine.
* The program uses a variable `flag` to check if all elements are the same, but it's not necessary. The program can simply check if `ans` is still infinity after the loop, and if so, print -1.

Correctness: **True**
