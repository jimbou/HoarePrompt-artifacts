Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either Infinity or 0, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is Infinity. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either Infinity or 0, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is Infinity. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val` and `cnt` is 0, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2, `ans` is either 0, 1, or Infinity, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is Infinity. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val` and `cnt` is 0, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
