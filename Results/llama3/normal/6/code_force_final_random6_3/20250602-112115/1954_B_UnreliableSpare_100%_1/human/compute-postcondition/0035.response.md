Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If all elements in `arr` are equal, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed.***
