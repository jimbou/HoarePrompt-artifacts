Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is Infinity, `val` is the first element of arr, `cnt` is 1. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `arr` is still a list of n positive integers, `flag` is still True if all elements in arr are equal and False otherwise, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is still Infinity, `val` is still the first element of arr, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still equal to `val`.
