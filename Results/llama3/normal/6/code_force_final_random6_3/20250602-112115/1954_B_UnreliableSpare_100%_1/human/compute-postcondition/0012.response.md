Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to infinity, and assigns the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `val`, and sets the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `flag` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed.
