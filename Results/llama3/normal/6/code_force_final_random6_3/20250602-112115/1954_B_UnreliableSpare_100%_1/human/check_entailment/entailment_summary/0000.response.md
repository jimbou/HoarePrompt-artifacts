Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same, in which case it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If the array is not all the same, it finds the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to the first element of the sequence, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
