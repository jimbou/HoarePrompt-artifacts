Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, ans is 0, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val.**

The code first assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially Infinity and `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
