Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of n positive integers, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, ans is either 0 or 1, val is the first element of arr, and cnt is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be either 0 or 1, depending on the previous value of `cnt`. If `cnt` was 1, then `ans` is now 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
