Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either 0, 1, or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
*   The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the array.
*   The array `arr` remains unchanged, containing `n` positive integers.
*   The value of `flag` remains unchanged, indicating whether all elements in `arr` are equal or not.
*   The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases - 2.
*   The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum length of contiguous subarrays with all elements equal to `val`. If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, then `ans` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to `val`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.
*   The value of `val` remains unchanged as the first element of `arr`.
*   The value of `cnt` is updated to the length of the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`. If the last element of `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 0.
