Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2, `ans` is either 0, 1, or Infinity, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is Infinity. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `val` and `cnt` is 0, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.**
