Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] will cause the program to print 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because we need to remove at least two elements to make the array not beautiful.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements with the same value, but it does not consider the case when the array has alternating elements. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle this case correctly.
