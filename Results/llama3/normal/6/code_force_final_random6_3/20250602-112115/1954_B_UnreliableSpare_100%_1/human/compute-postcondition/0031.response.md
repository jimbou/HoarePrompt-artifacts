Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `arr` with all elements equal to `val` ending at index `n - 1`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The current value of `flag` is True, indicating that all elements in `arr` are equal, and -1 is printed**
