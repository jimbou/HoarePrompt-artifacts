Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `ans` is either Infinity or 0, `val` is the first element of arr, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is Infinity. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the element at index i of arr is not equal to val.***
