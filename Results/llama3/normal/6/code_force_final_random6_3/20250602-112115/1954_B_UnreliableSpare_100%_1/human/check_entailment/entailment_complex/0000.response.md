Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, which is correct because removing any number of elements from an array with all equal elements will still result in a beautiful array.

2. If not all elements are equal, the program then finds the minimum length of the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to the first element of the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the current count of contiguous elements equal to the first element. Whenever it encounters an element not equal to the first element, it updates the minimum length if necessary.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the longest contiguous subarray with all elements equal to the first element is at the end of the array. This is done by updating the minimum length after the loop.

4. The program prints the minimum length found, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
