Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

The program works by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and prints the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated `n` times.

This approach is correct because it ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present as subsequences in the printed string. The repetition of the first `k` characters `n` times guarantees that every possible combination of characters is included.

For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program prints 'abab', which contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('aa', 'ab', 'ba', and 'bb') as subsequences.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
