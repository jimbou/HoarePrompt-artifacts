The code prints a string that is a repetition of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.
The first `k` characters of the alphabet are 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'k' (where `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive).
The string is repeated `n` times (where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive).
Output: **'a' to 'k' (where k is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive), repeated n times (where n is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive)**
