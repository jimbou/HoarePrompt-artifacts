Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the two positive integers between 1 and 26 inclusive from the input, which were separated by a space. The stdin is now empty as it has been read.
