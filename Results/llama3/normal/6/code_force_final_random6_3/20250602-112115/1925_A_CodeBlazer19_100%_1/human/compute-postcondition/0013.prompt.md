Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 26, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin now contains one input: a space-separated list of two integers, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
