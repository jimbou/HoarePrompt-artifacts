Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is printed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `t`, the variables `n` and `k` will still be positive integers between 1 and 26 inclusive, the standard input (stdin) will be empty, and the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated `n` times will be printed `t` times.
