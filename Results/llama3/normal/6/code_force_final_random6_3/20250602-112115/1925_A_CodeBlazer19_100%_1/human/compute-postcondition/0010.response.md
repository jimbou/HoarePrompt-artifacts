Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 26, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin now contains one input: a space-separated list of two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The stdin is now empty, and the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed. The values of `n` and `k` are still positive integers between 1 and 26 inclusive.
