Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the first k characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin is empty, and the values of `t` and `i` are not affected. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be positive integers between 1 and 26 inclusive.
