Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n - 1`. If the last two elements of `onum` are equal, then `ck` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `ck` is either 1 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
