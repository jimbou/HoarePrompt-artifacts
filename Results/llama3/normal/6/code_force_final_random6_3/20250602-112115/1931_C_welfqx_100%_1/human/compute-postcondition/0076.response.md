Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0, `ii` is -1, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. The current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`***
