Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n` if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `cn` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num`, `f` is 1. If the first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ii` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the break statement are still true.
