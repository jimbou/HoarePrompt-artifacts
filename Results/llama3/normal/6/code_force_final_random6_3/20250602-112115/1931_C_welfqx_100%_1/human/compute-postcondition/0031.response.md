Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `ck` is 1, and `cn` is 3 if the current and next elements in `num` are equal, or `cn` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current and next elements in `num` are not equal.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1. If the current and next elements in `num` are equal, `cn` is now 3. If the current and next elements in `num` are not equal, `cn` is now 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
