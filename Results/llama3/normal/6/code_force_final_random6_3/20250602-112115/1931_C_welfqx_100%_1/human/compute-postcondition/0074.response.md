Output State: **n is an integer, f is 1, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is 1, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is -1, ii is -1, cn is 1, ck is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num.**

The code snippet starts by creating a reversed copy of the list `num` and assigning it to `onum`. This operation does not change the original list `num`. Then, it initializes two new variables `cn` and `ck` to 1. The variable `f` is set to 1, which means that there are no pairs of adjacent elements in `num` that are not equal. The first element of `num` is assigned to `symb1`, and the last element of `num` (which is the first element of the reversed list `onum`) is assigned to `symb2`. The values of `n`, `t`, `r`, `j`, `i`, and `ii` remain unchanged.
