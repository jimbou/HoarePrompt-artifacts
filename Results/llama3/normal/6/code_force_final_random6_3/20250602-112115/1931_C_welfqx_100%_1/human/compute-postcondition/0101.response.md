Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n`, `ck` is either 2, 3 or 4.**

The value of `ck` is incremented by 1. Since `ck` was either 1, 2, or 3, it is now either 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables are not affected.
