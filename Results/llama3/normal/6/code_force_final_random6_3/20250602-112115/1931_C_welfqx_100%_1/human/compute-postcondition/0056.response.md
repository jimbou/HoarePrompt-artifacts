The only variable in the loop head is variable `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `t`. If `r` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is 1, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, ii is n - 2. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then ck is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of num and cn is equal to the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of num. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
