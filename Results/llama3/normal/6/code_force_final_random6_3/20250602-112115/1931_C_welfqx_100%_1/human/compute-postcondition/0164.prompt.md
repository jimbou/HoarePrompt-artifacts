Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, ii is n - 2. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then ck is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of num and cn is equal to the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of num. Otherwise, no changes are made. , and this is printed: the difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck, where cn is the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of num and ck is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of num.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is either `2n - 1` or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. The difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is the sum of n and n if all elements in num are the same and all elements in onum are the same and the first element of num is equal to the first element of the reversed num, otherwise cn is less than or equal to 2n, ck is n if all elements in onum are the same, otherwise ck is less than or equal to n, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, i is n - 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, ii is n - 1, and this is printed: n - max(cn, ck)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
