To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we know that `n` is at least 2, so we can adjust the state of `n` to be exactly 2, which is the minimum value required for the loop to execute. We also need to adjust the state of `ii` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 0**
