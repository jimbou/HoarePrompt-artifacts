Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1 or 2, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 0. If the first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
