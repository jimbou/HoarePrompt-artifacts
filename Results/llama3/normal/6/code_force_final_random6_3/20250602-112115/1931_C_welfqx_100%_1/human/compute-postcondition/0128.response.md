Output State: **onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num.**

The code creates a reversed copy of the list `num` and assigns it to `onum`. It then initializes the variables `cn` and `ck` to 1, and sets `f` to 1. The variables `symb1` and `symb2` are assigned the first elements of `num` and the reversed `num` respectively. The original values of `num` and other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
