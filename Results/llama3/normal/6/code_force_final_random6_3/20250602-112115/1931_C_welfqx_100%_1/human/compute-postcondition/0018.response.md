Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is a positive integer, f is either 0 or 1, num is a list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, j is n - 1. If n is 1 or f is 1, then 0 is printed and the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration.***
