Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 2, `ii` is -1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`, then `cn` is 4. Otherwise, `cn` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`, then `cn` is now 4. Otherwise, `cn` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
