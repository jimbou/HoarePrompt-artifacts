Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1 or 2, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
