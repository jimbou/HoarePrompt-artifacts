Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is a positive integer, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `ck` is 1, and either `cn` is 2 if the current and next elements in `num` are equal, or `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current and next elements in `num` are not equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `ck` is 1. If the current and next elements in `num` are equal, then `cn` is 3. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cn` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
