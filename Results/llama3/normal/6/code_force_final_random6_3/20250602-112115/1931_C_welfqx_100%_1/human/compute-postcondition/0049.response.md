Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 2, 3 or 4 if the second and third elements from the end of `num` are equal, otherwise `ck` is 1, 2 or 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 2.**
