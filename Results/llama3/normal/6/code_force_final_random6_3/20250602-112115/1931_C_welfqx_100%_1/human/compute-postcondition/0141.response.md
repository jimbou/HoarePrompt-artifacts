Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of num, `cn` is 3 if num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], otherwise `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values since the break statement does not affect any variable values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
