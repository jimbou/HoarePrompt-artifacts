Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means it exits the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered as it breaks out of the loop or if statement.
