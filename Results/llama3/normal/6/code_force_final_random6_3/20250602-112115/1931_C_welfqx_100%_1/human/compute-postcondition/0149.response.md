Postcondition: ***`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n` if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `cn` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num`, `f` is 1. If the first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
