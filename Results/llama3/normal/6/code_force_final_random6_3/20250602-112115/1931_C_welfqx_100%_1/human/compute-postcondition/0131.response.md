Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. The current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cn` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The condition that the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]` still holds true, as the code does not modify the values of `num`, `i`, or `n`.
