To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ii` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0 and `n` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, so `ii` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, which is 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1 or 2, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 1**
