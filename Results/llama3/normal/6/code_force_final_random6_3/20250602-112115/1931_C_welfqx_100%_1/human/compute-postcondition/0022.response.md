Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0. The current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`.**

The code increments the value of `cn` by 1. The initial value of `cn` is 1, so after the increment, `cn` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
