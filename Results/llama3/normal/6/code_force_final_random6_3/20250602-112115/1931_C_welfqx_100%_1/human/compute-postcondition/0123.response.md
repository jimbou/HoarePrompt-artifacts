Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, f is either 1 or 0, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is 2, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If symb1 is equal to symb2, then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If num[j] is equal to num[j + 1], then f is 1. Otherwise, the current value of num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1] and f is 0. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. The current value of n is 1 or f is 1.***
