Output State: **onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is n if all elements in num are the same, otherwise cn is less than or equal to n, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, i is n - 1, n is greater than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `onum` remains a reversed copy of the original list `num`. The variable `cn` will be equal to the length of `num` if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise, it will be less than or equal to the length of `num`. The variables `ck` and `f` remain unchanged at 1. The variables `symb1` and `symb2` still hold the first element of `num` and the first element of the reversed `num`, respectively. The loop counter `i` will be one less than the length of `num`, and `n` will be greater than or equal to 1.
