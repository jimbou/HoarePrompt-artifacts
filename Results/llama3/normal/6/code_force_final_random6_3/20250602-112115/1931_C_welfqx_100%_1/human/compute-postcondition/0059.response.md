Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is at least 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `num[j]` is not equal to the current value of `num[j + 1]`***
