Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n` if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `cn` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num`, `f` is 1, `ii` is `n + 1`. If the first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`, then `ck` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `ck` is either 2 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code has no effect on the values of the variables, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
