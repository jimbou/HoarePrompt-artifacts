Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 1, `ii` is -1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is 3 if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, but only if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`. If this condition is not met, the program would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of the variables would not have changed. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state.
