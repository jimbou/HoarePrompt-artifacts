Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1, 2 or 3, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values, and we simply add the fact that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
