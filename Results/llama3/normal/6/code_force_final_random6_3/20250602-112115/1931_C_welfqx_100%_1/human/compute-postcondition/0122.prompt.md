Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, f is 1, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is 2, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If symb1 is equal to symb2, then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed, stdin contains 1 input: an integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `f` is either 1 or 0, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is 2, `j` is 0, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n` - 2, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n` - 1, `ck` is either `n` - 1 or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is either 2`n` - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. The difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is being printed, `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, `f` is 0 and the current value of `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 2, f is either 1 or 0, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is 2, j is 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If symb1 is equal to symb2, then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If num[j] is equal to num[j + 1], then f is 1. Otherwise, f is 0 and the current value of num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1]. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 2, f is either 1 or 0, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is 2, j is 2, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If symb1 is equal to symb2, then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If num[j] is equal to num[j + 1], then f is 1. Otherwise, the current value of num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1] and f is 0. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
