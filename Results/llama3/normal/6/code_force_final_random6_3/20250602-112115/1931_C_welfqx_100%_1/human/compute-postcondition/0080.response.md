Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0, `ii` is -1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
