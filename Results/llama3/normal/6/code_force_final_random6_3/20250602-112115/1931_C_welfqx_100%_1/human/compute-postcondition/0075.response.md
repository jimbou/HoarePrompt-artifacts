To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2. Since `i` is initialized to `-1` before the loop, it should be adjusted to `0` for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0, `ii` is -1, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`**
