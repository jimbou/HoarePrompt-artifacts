Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n`, `ck` is either 1, 2 or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
