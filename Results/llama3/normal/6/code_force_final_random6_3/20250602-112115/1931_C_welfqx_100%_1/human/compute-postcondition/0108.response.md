The code prints the difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck`. Where `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ck` is either `n - 1` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is either `2n - 1` or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`.
Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is an integer greater than 1, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, and ck is either n - 1 or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num)**
