Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n` if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `cn` is less than or equal to `n`, `ck` is 2, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ii` is 0, and the current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `ck`, which is now 2, incremented by 1 from its initial value of 1.
