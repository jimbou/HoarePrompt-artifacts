Postcondition: ***n is an integer that must be at least 4, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is 1, j is at least 3, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 3, ii is n - 3, stdin contains no input. If num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], then f is 0. Otherwise, f remains 1.***
