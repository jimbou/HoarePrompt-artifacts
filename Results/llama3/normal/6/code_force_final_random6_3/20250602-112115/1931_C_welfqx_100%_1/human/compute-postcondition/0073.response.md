Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is 0 if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in num that are not equal, otherwise f is 1, num is a list of integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is 1, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is -1, ii is -1. If n is 1 or f is 1, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
