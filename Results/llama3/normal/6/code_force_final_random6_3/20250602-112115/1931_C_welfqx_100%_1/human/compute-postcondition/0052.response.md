Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, the first element of `num` (`symb1`) is equal to the last element of `num` (`symb2`), `i` is `n - 2`, `ck` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of `num`, `cn` is equal to the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of `num`, `ii` is `n - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been updated to be the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of `num`, which is `cn + ck`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
