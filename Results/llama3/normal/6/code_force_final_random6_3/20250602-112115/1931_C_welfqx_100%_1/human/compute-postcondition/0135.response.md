To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of num, `cn` is 2 if num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], otherwise `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2**
