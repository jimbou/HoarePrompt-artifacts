Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 0, and the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
