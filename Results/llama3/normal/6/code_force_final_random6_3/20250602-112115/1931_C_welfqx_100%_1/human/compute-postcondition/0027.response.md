Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cn` being equal to 2. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
