Output State: **onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is the sum of n and n if all elements in num are the same and all elements in onum are the same, otherwise cn is less than or equal to 2n, ck is n if all elements in onum are the same, otherwise ck is less than or equal to n, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, i is n - 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, ii is n - 1. The current value of symb1 is equal to symb2.**

In this output state, the value of cn has been updated to be the sum of cn and ck. If all elements in num are the same and all elements in onum are the same, then cn is now equal to 2n. Otherwise, cn is less than or equal to 2n. The values of the other variables remain the same.
