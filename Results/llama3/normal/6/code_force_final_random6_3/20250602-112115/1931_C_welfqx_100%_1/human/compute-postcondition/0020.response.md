According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0**
