Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers. It then checks if all elements in the list are equal. If they are, or if the list contains only one element, it prints 0. Otherwise, it counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first and last elements of the list, and prints the difference between the length of the list and the maximum of these two counts.**
