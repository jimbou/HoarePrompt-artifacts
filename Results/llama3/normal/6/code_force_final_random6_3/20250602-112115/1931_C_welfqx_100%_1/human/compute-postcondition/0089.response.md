Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is -1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is `n`. If not all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains an integer, but it must be at least 2 to allow the loop to execute at least once.
*   The value of `f` remains 1.
*   The value of `num` remains a list of integers.
*   The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
*   The value of `r` remains 1.
*   The value of `j` remains `n - 1`.
*   The value of `onum` remains a reversed copy of `num`.
*   The value of `i` becomes `n - 2` after the loop finishes executing all its iterations.
*   The value of `ii` remains -1.
*   The value of `ck` remains 1.
*   The value of `symb1` remains the first element of `num`.
*   The value of `symb2` remains the last element of `num`.
*   The value of `cn` depends on the elements of `num`. If all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` becomes `n`. If not all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` becomes the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.
