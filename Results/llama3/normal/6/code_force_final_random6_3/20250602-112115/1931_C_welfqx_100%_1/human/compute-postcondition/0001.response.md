The only variable in the loop head is variable `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `r` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
