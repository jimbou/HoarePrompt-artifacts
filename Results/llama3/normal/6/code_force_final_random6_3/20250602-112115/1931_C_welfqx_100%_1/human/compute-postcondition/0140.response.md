Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of num, `cn` is either 4 or 3, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3**

The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. Since `cn` is either 3 or 2, its new value is either 4 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.
