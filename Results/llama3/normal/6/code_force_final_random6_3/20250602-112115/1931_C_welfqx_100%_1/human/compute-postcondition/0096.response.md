To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for ii in range(n - 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop counter.

According to the code, `ii` is initialized to 0 and will iterate up to `n - 2` (since the range is `n - 1`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n - 1`**

Note that only the state of `ii` is adjusted, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
