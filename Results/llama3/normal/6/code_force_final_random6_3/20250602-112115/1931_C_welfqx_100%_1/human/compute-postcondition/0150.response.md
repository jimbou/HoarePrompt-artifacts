The only variable in the loop head is variable  ii and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ii` and `n`. If `ii` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be increased by 1, so `ii` is `n` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n` if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `cn` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num`, `f` is 1. If the first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ii` is `n`.**
