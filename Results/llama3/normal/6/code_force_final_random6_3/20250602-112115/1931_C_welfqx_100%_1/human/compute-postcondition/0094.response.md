Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is 0, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is `n`. If not all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `n`, `f`, `num`, `t`, `r`, `j`, `onum`, `i`, `ii`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `cn` remain unchanged.
