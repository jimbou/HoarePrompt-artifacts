Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the structure of each test case remains the same: an integer followed by a list of integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists still does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
