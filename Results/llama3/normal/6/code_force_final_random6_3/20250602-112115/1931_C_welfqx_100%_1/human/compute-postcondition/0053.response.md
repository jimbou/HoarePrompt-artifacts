Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 2, ii is n - 2. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then ck is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of num and cn is equal to the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of num. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
