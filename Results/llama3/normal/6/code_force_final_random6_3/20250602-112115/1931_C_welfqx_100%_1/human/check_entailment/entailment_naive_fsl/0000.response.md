Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

6
1 2 2 3 3 3

The program will output 3, but the correct answer is 2. The program only checks for the maximum length of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of the array, but it does not consider the case where the maximum length of consecutive equal elements is in the middle of the array.

In this case, the maximum length of consecutive equal elements is 3 (the three 3's in the middle of the array), but the program only considers the length of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of the array, which is 2 (the two 2's at the start and the two 3's at the end). Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
