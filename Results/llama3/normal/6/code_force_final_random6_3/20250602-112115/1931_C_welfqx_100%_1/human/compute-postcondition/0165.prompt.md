You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        f = 1
        
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
                f = 0
                break
        
        if n == 1 or f == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        onum = num.copy()
        
        onum.reverse()
        
        cn = 1
        
        ck = 1
        
        f = 1
        
        symb1 = num[0]
        
        symb2 = onum[0]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break
        
        for ii in range(n - 1):
            if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
                ck += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if symb1 == symb2:
            cn += ck
        
        print(n - max(cn, ck))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, r is t - 1, n is at least 1, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 1, ii is n - 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ck is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.

Return Postconditions: t is a positive integer, r is t - 1, n is at least 1, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 1, ii is n - 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ck is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
