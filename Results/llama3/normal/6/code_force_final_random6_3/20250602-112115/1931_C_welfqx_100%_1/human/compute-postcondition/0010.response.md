The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is a positive integer greater than 2, num is a list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, j is 2, if num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], then f is 0, otherwise f remains unchanged.**
