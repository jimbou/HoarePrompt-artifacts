Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        f = 1
        
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
                f = 0
                break
        
        if n == 1 or f == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        onum = num.copy()
        
        onum.reverse()
        
        cn = 1
        
        ck = 1
        
        f = 1
        
        symb1 = num[0]
        
        symb2 = onum[0]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break
        
        for ii in range(n - 1):
            if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
                ck += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if symb1 == symb2:
            cn += ck
        
        print(n - max(cn, ck))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, r is t - 1, n is at least 1, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 1, ii is n - 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ck is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.
