Output State: **onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is n if all elements in num are the same, otherwise cn is less than or equal to n, ck is n if all elements in onum are the same, otherwise ck is less than or equal to n, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, i is n - 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, ii is n - 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables onum, cn, ck, f, symb1, symb2, i, and n have the same values as in the initial state, except for ck, which is now equal to n if all elements in onum are the same, otherwise it is less than or equal to n. The variable ii is now equal to n - 1.
