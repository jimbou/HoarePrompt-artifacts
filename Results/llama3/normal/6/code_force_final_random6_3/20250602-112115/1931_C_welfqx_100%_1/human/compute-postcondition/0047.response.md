Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 2, 3 or 4, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 2**

The code increments the value of `ck` by 1. The initial state of `ck` is 1, 2, or 3, so after the increment, `ck` becomes 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
