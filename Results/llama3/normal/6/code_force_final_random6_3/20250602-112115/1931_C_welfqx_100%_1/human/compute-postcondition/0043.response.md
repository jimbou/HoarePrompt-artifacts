Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 2 or 3, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
