Output State: **onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 1, and num[i] is not equal to num[i + 1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables onum, cn, ck, f, symb1, symb2, `i`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
