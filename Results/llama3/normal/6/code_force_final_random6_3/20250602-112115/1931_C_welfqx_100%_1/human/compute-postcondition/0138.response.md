Postcondition: ***`onum` is a reversed copy of num, `cn` is 3 if num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], otherwise `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. If num[i] is not equal to num[i + 1], we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
