Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ck` is either 2 or 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
