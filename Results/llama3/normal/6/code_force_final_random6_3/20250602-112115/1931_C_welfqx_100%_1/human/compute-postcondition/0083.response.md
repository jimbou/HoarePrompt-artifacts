Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 1, `ii` is -1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`, then `cn` is 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
