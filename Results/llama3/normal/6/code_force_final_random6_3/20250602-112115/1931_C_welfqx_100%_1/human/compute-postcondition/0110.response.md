The only variable in the loop head is variable `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `t`. If `r` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is either `n` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is either `2n - 1` or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num`. The difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is being printed.**
