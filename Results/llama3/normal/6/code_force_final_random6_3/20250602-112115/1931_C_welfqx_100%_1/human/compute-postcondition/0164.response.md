Output State: **t is a positive integer, r is t - 1, n is at least 1, f is 1, num is a list of positive integers, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, i is n - 1, ii is n - 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, cn is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, ck is either n or the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. If the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then cn is either 2n - 1 or the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of num. The difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations specified by the value of `t`. The loop variables `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `i`, `ii`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, and `ck` have reached their final values after the last iteration. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `r` is now `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The values of `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `i`, `ii`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, and `ck` are determined based on the last iteration of the loop. The difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is printed after each iteration, and this output state reflects the final values of these variables after all iterations have completed.
