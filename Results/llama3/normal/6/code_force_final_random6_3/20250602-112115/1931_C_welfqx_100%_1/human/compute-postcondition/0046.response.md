To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for ii in range(n - 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `ii` is 1 and `n` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `ii` is 2 (incremented by 1)
* `n` is still 2 (no change)

The other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `i`, `ck`, and `cn`) are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `ck` is 1, 2 or 3, `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ii` is 2**
