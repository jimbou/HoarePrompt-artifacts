Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `ck` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered by breaking out of the loop or if statement.
