Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0, `ii` is -1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is 2, and the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values except for `cn`, which has been incremented by 1. The relationship between `num[i]` and `num[i + 1]` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect the values of `num`.
