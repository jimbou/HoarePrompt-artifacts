Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of num, `cn` is 3 if num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], otherwise `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2**

The code increments the value of `cn` by 1. Since `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `cn` is 1, the new value of `cn` will be 3 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise it will be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
