Output State: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1. If all elements in `num` are equal, then `cn` is `n`. Otherwise, `cn` is less than `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.*

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables not affected by the loop (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `ck`) remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`. If all elements in the list `num` are equal, the counter `cn` has reached its maximum value of `n`. Otherwise, `cn` is less than `n` and the loop has broken out of its most internal loop or if statement.
