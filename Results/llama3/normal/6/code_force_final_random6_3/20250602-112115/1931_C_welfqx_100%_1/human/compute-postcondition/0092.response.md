Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is 0, `ck` is 2, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is `n`. If not all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`.**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ck` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
