Postcondition: ***onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 2 if num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], otherwise cn is 1, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, i is 0, n is greater than 1. If num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then the current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1]. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
