The only variables in the loop head are variables  ii and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ii` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer that must be at least 2, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and ii is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is 0, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is `n`. If not all elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.**
