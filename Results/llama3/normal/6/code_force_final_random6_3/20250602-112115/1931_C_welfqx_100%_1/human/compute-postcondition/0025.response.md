Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of positive integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
