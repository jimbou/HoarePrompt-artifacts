The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of the reversed num, `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 1**
