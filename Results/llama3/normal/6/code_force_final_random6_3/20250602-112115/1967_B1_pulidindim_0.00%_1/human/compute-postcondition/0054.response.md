Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + (g - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 2, g is n / 3. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes.**
