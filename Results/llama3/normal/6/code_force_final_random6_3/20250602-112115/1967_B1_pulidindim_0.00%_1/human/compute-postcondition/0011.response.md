Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
