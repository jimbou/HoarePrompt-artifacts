The first line decrements `countmins` by 1, making it equal to `count - 1`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. The second line assigns the value of `n / count` to `g`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n / 2`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n / 2**
