Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + (g - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 2, g is n / 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, i, n, m, count, ans, countmins, and g remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
