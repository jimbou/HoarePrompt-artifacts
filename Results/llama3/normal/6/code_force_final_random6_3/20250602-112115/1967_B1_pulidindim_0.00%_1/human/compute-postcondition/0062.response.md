The code prints the integer value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the series `(n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1` for `k` from 2 to `m`.

Since `ans` is calculated using the formula `n + the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` without knowing the values of `n` and `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans` as an integer.

Output: **n + the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m (where n and m are positive integers)**
