According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m. If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 4, m is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, count must be less than or equal to m, so m needs to be adjusted to m is greater than or equal to 5.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 5, count is 4, ans is n + (g - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g - countmins) / count + 1, countmins is 2, g is n / 3 - countmins**
