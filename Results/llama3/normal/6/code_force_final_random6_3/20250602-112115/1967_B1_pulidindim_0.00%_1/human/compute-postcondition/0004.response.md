Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, and stdin contains one less test case, n is a positive integer, m is at least 2, count is 2, ans is equal to n, countmins is 1, g is n / 2.**

The code modifies the values of `countmins` and `g`. The first line assigns the value of `count - 1` to `countmins`, making `countmins` equal to 1. The second line assigns the value of `n / count` to `g`, making `g` equal to `n / 2`. No other variables are affected.
