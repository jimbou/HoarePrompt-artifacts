The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `count` is m + 1, `ans` is n + sum((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1)), `countmins` is m, `g` is n / m - (m - 1)**
