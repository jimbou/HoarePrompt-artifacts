Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n / 2**

The code modifies the values of `countmins` and `g`. The first line decrements `countmins` by 1, making it 1. The second line recalculates `g` as `n / count`, which is `n / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
