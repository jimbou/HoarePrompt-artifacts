Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n / 2. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of the variables.***
