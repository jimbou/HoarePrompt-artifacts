Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates a value 'ans' by adding a series of fractions to 'n', and then prints the integer value of 'ans'. The series is calculated by iterating from 2 to m, adding the result of the division of 'n' by the current number minus the current number minus one, divided by the current number plus one, to 'ans'. The function continues this process until it has processed all test cases.**
