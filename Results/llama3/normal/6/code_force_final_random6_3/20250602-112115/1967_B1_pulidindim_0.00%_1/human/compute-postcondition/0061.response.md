Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m, countmins is m - 1, g is n / m - (m - 1).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains a positive integer greater than 1, i remains 2, n remains a positive integer, m remains a positive integer, count is now m + 1, ans is now n plus the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m, countmins is now m - 1, and g is now n / m - (m - 1).
