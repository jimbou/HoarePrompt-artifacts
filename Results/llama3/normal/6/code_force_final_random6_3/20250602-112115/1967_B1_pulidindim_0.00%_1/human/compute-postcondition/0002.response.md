Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, and stdin contains one less test case, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is 2, ans is equal to n.**
