According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m. If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 3 and m is at least 2. count being 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to count is less than or equal to m. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer, m is at least 3, count is 3, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 1, g is n / 2 - 1**
