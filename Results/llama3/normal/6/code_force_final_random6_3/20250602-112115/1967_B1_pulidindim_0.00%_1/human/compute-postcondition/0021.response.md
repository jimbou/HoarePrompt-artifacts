Output: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + sum((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1)), countmins is m, g is n / m - (m - 1), and the integer value of ans which is the sum of n and the sum of the terms ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k in the range from 2 to m (inclusive) is being printed**
