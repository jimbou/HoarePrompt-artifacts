Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, and stdin contains one less test case.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The remaining test cases in the stdin are still present, but one test case has been removed. The values of n and m in the remaining test cases are still within the given constraints.
