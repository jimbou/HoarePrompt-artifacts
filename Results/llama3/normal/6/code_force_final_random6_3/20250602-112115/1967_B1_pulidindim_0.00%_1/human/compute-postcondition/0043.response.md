State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (n / m - (m - 1)) / m + 1, countmins is m - 1, g is n / m - (m - 1), and the integer value of ans which is the sum of n and the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m is being printed**
