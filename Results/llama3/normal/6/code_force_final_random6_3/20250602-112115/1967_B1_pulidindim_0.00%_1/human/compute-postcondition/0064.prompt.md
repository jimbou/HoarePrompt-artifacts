Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, and stdin contains one less test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + sum((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1)), countmins is m, g is n / m - (m - 1), and the integer value of ans which is the sum of n and the sum of the terms ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k in the range from 2 to m (inclusive) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (n / m - (m - 1)) / m + 1, countmins is m - 1, g is n / m - (m - 1), and the integer value of ans which is the sum of n and the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + the sum of the series (n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k from 2 to m, countmins is m - 1, g is n / m - (m - 1), and the integer value of ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
