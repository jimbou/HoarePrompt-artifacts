Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains one less test case.
