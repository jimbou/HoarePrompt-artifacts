To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, and stdin contains one less test case.**
