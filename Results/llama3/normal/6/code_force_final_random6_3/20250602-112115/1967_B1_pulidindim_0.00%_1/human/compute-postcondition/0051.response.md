According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m. If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 3, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2. m being greater than or equal to 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to m is greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + (g - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 1, g is g - 1.**
