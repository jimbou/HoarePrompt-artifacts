Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The condition `g` is less than `countmins` is still valid, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
