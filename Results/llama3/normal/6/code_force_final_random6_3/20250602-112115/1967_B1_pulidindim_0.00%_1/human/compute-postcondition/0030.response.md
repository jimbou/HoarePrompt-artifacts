The variable in the loop head is variable count and m, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m.  If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 3 and m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time m must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 1, g is n / 2 - 1**
