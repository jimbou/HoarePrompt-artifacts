Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is less than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, i, n, m, count, ans, countmins, and g remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
