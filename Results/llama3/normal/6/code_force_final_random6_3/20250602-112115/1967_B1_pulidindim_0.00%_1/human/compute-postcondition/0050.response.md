Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 3, ans is n + (g - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 1, g is g - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `m` remains unchanged as a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(g - 1) / 2 + 1` to `n`. The value of `countmins` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `g` is decremented by 1.
