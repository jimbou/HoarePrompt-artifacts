Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 4, count is 4, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 4 + 1, countmins is 3. If n / 4 is less than 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
