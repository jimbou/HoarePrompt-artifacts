Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer, m is at least 5, count is 4, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g - 2) / 4 + 1, countmins is 3, g is n / 4. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
