To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `count` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `count` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 4 and `m` is at least 3. Since `count` is already greater than `m`, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 5.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer, m is at least 5, count is 4, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g - 2) / 4 + 1, countmins is 2, g is g - 2**
