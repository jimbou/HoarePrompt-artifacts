Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1, countmins is 2, g is n / 3. If g is less than countmins, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
