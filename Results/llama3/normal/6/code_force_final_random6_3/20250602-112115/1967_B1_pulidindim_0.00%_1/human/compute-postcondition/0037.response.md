Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 4, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 4 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. All the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
