Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
