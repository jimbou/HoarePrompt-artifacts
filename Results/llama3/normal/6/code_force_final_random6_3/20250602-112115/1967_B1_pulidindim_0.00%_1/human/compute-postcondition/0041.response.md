The code prints the integer value of `ans`, which is a mathematical expression involving the variables `n` and `m`. The expression is a sum of terms, where each term is of the form `(n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1`, where `k` ranges from 2 to `m`.

Since `n` and `m` are positive integers, the expression can be evaluated exactly. However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and `m`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.

Based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer value of the expression `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (n / m - (m - 1)) / m + 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers.

Output: **integer value of the expression n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (n / m - (m - 1)) / m + 1 (where n and m are positive integers)**
