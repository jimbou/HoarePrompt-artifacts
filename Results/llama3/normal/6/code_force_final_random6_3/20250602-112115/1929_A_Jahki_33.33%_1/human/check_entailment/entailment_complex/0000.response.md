Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the input list `a` is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, the program prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The function `func_1` checks if the input list `a` is sorted in ascending order by iterating through the list and checking if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one. If it finds an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous one, it increments a counter `order`. If the counter `order` is 0 at the end of the iteration, it means that the list is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The main program uses the function `func_1` to check if the input list `a` is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, the program prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order using the `sorted` function and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the input list is sorted in ascending order, and the main program correctly uses this function to determine whether to print 0 or calculate the maximum beauty.

Correctness: **True**
