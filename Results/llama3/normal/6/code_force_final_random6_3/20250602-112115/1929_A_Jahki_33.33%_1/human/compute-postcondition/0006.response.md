Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, `order` is either 2 or not specified.**

The code increments the value of `order` by 1. Since the initial state of `order` is either 1 or not specified, the new state of `order` is either 2 or not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.
