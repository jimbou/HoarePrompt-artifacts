According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num2`. If `num2` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, so it needs to be adjusted to be at least 2. Also, the variable `i` is introduced in the loop head, so its state needs to be adjusted as well. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `order` is 0, `i` is 1**
