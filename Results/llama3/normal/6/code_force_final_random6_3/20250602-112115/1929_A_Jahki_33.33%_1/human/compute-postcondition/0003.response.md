Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `order` is 1, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `order` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `a` still being a list of integers, `num2` representing the length of `a`, and all elements in `a` being integers between 1 and 10^9. The relationship between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` also remains the same, with `a[i - 1]` being greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
