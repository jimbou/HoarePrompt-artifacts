Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program takes the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the elements of the array as input. It then checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the `func_1` function. If the array is already sorted, it prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly checks if the array is already sorted and calculates the maximum beauty if it's not. The `func_1` function is also correct in determining if the array is sorted in ascending order.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The `func_1` function is not necessary, and the program can be simplified by removing it. The program can directly sort the array and calculate the maximum beauty without checking if the array is already sorted.

Despite this minor issue, the program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
