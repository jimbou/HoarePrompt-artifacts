Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `order` is either 3 or not specified. Otherwise, the state of `order` is not specified.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `order` is either 3 or not specified, because it was either 2 or not specified before the increment. Otherwise, the state of `order` is still not specified. The values of the other variables are not affected.
