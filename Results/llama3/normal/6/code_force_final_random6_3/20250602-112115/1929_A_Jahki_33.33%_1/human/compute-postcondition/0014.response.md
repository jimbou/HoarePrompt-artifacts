Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is `num2 - 1`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `order` is `num2 - 1`. Otherwise, the state of `order` is not specified. `order` is not equal to 0***
