Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which checks if the input array is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` as the maximum beauty. However, this is incorrect because the problem statement allows Sasha to rearrange the elements of the array in any way to maximize the beauty.

A counterexample is the input `[3, 2, 1]`. The program will print `0` because the array is already sorted in descending order, but the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the elements to `[1, 2, 3]`, which has a beauty of `2`.

The correct approach is to always sort the array in ascending order and calculate the beauty, regardless of the original order of the elements. The program should remove the `func_1` function and the conditional statement that checks its return value.
