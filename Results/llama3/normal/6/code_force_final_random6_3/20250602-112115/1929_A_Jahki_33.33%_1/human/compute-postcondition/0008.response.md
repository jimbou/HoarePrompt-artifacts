To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num2`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `num2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `num2` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `num2` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

The state of `a` and its elements does not need to be adjusted, as it is not part of the loop head. The state of `order` is also not specified and does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `order` is either 2 or not specified. Otherwise, the state of `order` is not specified.**
