Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, `2 <= num2 <= 100`, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `order` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains unchanged, the length of the list `a` is still represented by `num2` and is between 2 and 100, all elements in `a` are still integers between 1 and 10^9, and a new variable `order` is introduced with a value of 0.
