Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the `func_1` function. If the array is already sorted, it prints 0 as the beauty of the array.

If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The `func_1` function checks if the array is already sorted by iterating over the elements and checking if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. If any element is not greater than or equal to the previous element, the function returns False. If all elements are greater than or equal to the previous element, the function returns True.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
