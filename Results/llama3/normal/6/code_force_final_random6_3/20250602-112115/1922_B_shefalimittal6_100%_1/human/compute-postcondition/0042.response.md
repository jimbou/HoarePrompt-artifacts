Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+3, results is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index x which is n, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is n-1, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following changes:

* The loop variable `_` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The index `idx` will be equal to `2n+3`, indicating that the loop has accessed `n` elements from the `data` list.
* The list `v` will have all indices equal to 0 except for index `x`, which will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has incremented the value at index `x` `n` times.
* The variable `x` will be equal to its original value plus `n-1`, indicating that the loop has accessed `n` different indices in the `v` list.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
