Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+4, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0, i is n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is n, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n-1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `idx`, and `v`. The first line assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `n`, which is greater than 0. The second line increments `idx` by 1, making it `2n+4`. The third line creates a new list `v` with `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0. The previous values of `v` are not used in this new assignment, so the old list is discarded. The other variables remain unchanged.
