Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 4n+4, `results` is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a list of integers where the value at index x is n+1 and all other indices are 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2 + (n+1) * n * (n-1) // 6, `_` is n, `x` is an integer equal to the value at index idx-1 of data.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the sum of combinations of triples of elements in `v`, which is `(n+1) * n * (n-1) // 6`, added to the previous value of `ans`, which was `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
