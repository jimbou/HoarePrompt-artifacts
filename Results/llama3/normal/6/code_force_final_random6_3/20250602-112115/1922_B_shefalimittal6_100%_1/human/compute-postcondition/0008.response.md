Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 5, results is an empty list, n is greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 integers where the xth index is 3 and all other indices are 0, stdin is empty, _ is 1**

The code block executes as follows:

1. `x = int(data[idx])`: Assigns the integer value of the string at index `idx` in the `data` list to `x`. Since `idx` is 4, `x` becomes the integer value of the string at index 4 in `data`.

2. `idx += 1`: Increments `idx` by 1, making it 5.

3. `v[x] += 1`: Increments the value at index `x` in the `v` list by 1. Since `x` is the integer value of the string at index 4 in `data`, the value at that index in `v` is incremented by 1.

The final state is a combination of the initial state and the changes made by the code block. The values of `t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is incremented to 5, and the value at index `x` in `v` is incremented by 1, making it 3.
