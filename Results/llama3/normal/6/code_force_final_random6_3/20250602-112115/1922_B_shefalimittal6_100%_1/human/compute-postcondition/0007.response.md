The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined (because it is a throwaway variable), `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the xth index is 2 and all other indices are 0, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1**
