Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The key insight is that the length of the sticks is 2^{a_i}, and a triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick.

The program first counts the number of sticks of each length (v[x] += 1) and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle. It does this by iterating over the lengths of the sticks and calculating the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length (v[i] >= 2) and 1 stick of a different length (cnt), and adding this to the total count (ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2). It also calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (v[i] >= 3) and adds this to the total count (ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6).

The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple sticks of the same length, and it correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle. It also correctly handles the case where there are no sticks of a certain length (v[i] == 0).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
