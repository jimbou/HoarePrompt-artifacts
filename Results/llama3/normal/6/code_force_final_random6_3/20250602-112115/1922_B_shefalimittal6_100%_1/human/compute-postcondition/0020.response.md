Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + cnt * n * (n - 1) // 2` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and `(v[i] - 1) // 2`. Since `i` is 1 and `v[i]` is `n`, the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` simplifies to `cnt * n * (n - 1) // 2`. The value of `cnt` depends on `n`, so the updated value of `ans` also depends on `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `cnt` is `n`, and `ans` becomes `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + n * n * (n - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
