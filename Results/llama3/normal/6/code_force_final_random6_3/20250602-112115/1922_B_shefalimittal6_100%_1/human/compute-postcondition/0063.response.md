Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by `v[2]`, `ans` is increased by `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` if `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding `v[2]` to it. The value of `ans` has also been updated if `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 3, by adding `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
