Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 4, results is an empty list, n is greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 integers where the xth index is 2 and all other indices are 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `data` also remains the same as it is not modified. The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `results` remains an empty list as it is not modified. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as it is not modified. The value of `v` is modified, where the xth index is now 2 (since `v[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` by 1), and all other indices remain 0. The state of `stdin` remains empty as it is not modified.
