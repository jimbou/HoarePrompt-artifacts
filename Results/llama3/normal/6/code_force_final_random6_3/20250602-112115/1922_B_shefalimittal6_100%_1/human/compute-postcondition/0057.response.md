Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is increased by `v[1]`, `ans` is increased by `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6` if `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the value of `v[1]` to it. The value of `ans` has also been updated based on the value of `v[1]`. If `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` has been increased by the product of `v[1]`, `v[1] - 1`, and `v[1] - 2`, divided by 6. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
