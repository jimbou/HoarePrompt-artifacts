Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is n+2, results is an empty list, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where the xth index is n and all other indices are 0, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 't' remains a positive integer greater than 0, the 'data' list remains unchanged, the 'idx' variable has incremented 'n' times and is now 'n+2', the 'results' list remains empty, 'n' is still greater than 0, the 'v' list has its xth index incremented to 'n' and all other indices remain 0, and 'stdin' remains empty.
