Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+7, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index x is 2 and the value at index n is 1 and all other indices are 0, i is n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v plus 1, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is 1, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n plus the value at index idx-1 of data.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `x` has been updated to be the integer value at index `idx-1` of `data`. The value of `v` at index `x` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
