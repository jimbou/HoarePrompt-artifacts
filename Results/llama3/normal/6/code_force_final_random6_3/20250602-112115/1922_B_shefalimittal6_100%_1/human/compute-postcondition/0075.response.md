Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 4n+4, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is 0, v is a list of integers where the value at index x is n+1 and all other indices are 0, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is 0, _ is n, x is an integer equal to the value at index idx-1 of data.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value of 0 to the variables `cnt` and `ans`, respectively. The initial state provides information about various variables, including `t`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, `_`, and `x`. 

After executing the code, the values of `cnt` and `ans` are updated to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `cnt` and `ans` now having a value of 0.
