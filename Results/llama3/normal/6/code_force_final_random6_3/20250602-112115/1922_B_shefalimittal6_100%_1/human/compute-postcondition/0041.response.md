Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is n+6, results is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 2, v is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index x which is 3, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is 2, x is an integer equal to its original value plus 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx`, `x`, and `v[x]`. The first line assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `x`, which was previously an integer. The second line increments `idx` by 1, making it `n+6`. The third line increments the value of `v[x]` by 1, making it 3. No other variables are affected.
