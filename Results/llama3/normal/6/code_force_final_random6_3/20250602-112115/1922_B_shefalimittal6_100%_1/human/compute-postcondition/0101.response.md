Output: **`t` is 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `t*n+2*t`, `results` is a list containing `t` strings where each string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a list of integers where the value at index `x` is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `_` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx-1` of `data`, and the results are printed, where results are the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`**
