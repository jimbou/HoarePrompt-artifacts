To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already greater than 0, we can conclude that `n + 1` will always be greater than 0.

However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the range of `n + 1`. Since `i` is not initialized before the loop, we can set it to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
