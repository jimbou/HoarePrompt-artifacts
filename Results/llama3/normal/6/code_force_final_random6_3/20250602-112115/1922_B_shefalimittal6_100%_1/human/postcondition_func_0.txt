This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of two lines each. Each block contains a positive integer n and a list of n non-negative integers. The function calculates the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in each block and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results, one per line.
