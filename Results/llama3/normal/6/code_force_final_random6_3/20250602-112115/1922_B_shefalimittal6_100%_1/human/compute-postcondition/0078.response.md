Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 4n+4, `results` is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a list of integers where the value at index x is n+1 and all other indices are 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2`, `_` is n, `x` is an integer equal to the value at index idx-1 of data.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and the integer division of `v[i] - 1` by 2. Since `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 0, `v[i]` is equal to `n+1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
