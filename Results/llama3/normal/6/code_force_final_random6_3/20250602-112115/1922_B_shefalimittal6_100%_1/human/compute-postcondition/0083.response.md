Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 4n+4, `results` is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a list of integers where the value at index x is n+1 and all other indices are 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is n+1, `ans` is either `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2` or `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2 + (n+1) * n * (n-1) // 6` depending on whether `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is n, `x` is an integer equal to the value at index idx-1 of data.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `v[i]`, which is `n+1` since `i` is 0. The value of `ans` is updated based on whether `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2 + (n+1) * n * (n-1) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `cnt * (n+1) * n // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
