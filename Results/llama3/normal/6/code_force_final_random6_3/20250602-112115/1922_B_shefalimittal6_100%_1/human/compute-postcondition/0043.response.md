Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+3, results is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index x which is n, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, _ is n-1, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n-1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign new values to existing variables. The first line sets `cnt` to 0, and the second line sets `ans` to 0. 

The initial state of `cnt` and `ans` is not explicitly stated, but based on the provided information, we can infer that `cnt` and `ans` are being reset to 0. 

The rest of the variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. Therefore, the final output state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `cnt` and `ans` updated to 0.
