Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `cnt` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + cnt * n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, `ans` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the value of `v[i]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` has been incremented by `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, the value of `ans` remains the same. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
