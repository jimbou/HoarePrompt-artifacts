Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to its original value plus `n-1`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6.***
