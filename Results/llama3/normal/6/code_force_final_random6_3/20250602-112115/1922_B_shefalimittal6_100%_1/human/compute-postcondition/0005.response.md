The only variable in the loop head is variable  n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 3, results is an empty list, n is greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 integers where the xth index is 1 and all other indices are 0, stdin is empty**
