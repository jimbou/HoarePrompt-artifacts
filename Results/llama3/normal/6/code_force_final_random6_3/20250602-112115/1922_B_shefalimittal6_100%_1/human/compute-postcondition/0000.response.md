Output State: **t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**.

The first line assigns the entire input from stdin to the variable `input`. The second line splits the input into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns it to the variable `data`. The third line initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The fourth line converts the first element of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The fifth line increments the `idx` variable by 1. The sixth line initializes an empty list and assigns it to the variable `results`.
