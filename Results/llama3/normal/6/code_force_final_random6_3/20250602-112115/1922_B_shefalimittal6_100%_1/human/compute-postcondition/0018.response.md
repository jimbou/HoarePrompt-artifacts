Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it remains 0. The value of `ans` has also been updated accordingly based on the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
