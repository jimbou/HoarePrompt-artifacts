The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+5`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 2, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is 2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `_` is 2, `x` is an integer**
