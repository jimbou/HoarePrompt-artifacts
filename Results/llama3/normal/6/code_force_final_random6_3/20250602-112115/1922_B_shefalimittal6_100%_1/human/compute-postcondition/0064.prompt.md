Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+3, results is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index x which is n, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, _ is n-1, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n-1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to its original value plus `n-1`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is increased by `v[1]`, `ans` is increased by `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6` if `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by `v[2]`, `ans` is increased by `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` if `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
