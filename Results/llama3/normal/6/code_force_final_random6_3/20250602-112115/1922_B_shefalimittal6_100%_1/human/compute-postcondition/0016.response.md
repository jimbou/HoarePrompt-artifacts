Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the product of `v[i]`, `v[i] - 1`, and `v[i] - 2`, divided by 6, to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `cnt` is 0, the term `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` does not contribute to the new value of `ans`.
