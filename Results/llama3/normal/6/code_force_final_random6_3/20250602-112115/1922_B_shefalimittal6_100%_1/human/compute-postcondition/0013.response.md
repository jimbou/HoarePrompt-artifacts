Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and `v[i] - 1`, divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `cnt` is 0, the value of `ans` is also 0.
