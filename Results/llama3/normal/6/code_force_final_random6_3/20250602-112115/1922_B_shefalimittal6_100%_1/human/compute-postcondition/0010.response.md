The code snippet initializes two new variables, `cnt` and `ans`, and assigns them the value 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is n+2, results is an empty list, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where the xth index is n and all other indices are 0, cnt is 0, ans is 0**
