Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by `v[1]`. If `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[2] * (v[2] - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `ans` is also increased by `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6` if `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`.***
