To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n-1` and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v` and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `_` is `n`, `x` is an integer equal to its original value plus `n-1`.**
