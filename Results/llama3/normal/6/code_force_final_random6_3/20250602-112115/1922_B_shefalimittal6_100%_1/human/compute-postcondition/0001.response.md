To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to make it explicit that `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty**
