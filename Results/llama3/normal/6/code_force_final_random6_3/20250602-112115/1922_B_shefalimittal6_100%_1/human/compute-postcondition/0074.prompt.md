Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+4, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0, i is n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is n, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n-1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+5, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index x is 1 and all other indices are 0, i is n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v plus 1, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is 0, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n-1 and also equal to the integer value at index idx-1 in data

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+7, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index x is 2 and the value at index n is 1 and all other indices are 0, i is n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v plus 1, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is 1, x is an integer equal to its original value plus n plus the value at index idx-1 of data.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2n+8, results is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, n is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, v is a list of n integers where the value at index x is 3 and the value at index n-1 is 1 and all other indices are 0, i is n-1, cnt is the sum of all elements in v plus 1, ans is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in v, _ is 1, x is an integer equal to the value at index idx-1 of data




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
