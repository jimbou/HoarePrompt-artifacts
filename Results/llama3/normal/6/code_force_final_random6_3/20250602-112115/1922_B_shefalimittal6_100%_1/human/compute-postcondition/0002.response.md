Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the input, idx is 2, results is an empty list, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1, v is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The `data` list also remains unchanged as a list of strings split from the input. The `idx` variable is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The `results` list remains empty. A new variable `n` is introduced, which is assigned the integer value of the element at index 1 in the `data` list. Another new variable `v` is created, which is a list of `n+1` zeros. The `stdin` remains empty, as it was initially.
