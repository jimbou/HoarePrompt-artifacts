To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its state. However, `n` is crucial for the loop to execute.

According to the code, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` is empty**
