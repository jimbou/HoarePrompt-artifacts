Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v` and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `_` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to its original value plus `n-1`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `results` list now contains two strings, both of which are the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
