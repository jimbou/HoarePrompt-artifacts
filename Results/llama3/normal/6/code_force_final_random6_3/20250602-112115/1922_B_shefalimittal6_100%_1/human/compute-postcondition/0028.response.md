Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `cnt` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + cnt * n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3 and `n` is less than 3, otherwise `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, `ans` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated based on the value of `v[i]` and `n`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` has been increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, `ans` remains the same.
