The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+3, `results` is a list containing one string which is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where all indices are 0 except for index `x` which is `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to its original value plus `n-1`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6**
