To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable, and `n`, which is the upper limit of the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be decremented by 1, since the range function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

The variable `_` is an iteration variable and is not used in the loop body, so its value is not important.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `x`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2n+7, `results` is a list containing two strings where the first string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v` and the second string is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `v` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `x` is 2 and the value at index `n-1` is 1 and all other indices are 0, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` plus 1, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triples of elements in `v`, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer equal to its original value plus `n-1` plus the value at index `idx-1` of `data`**
