Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is `n+2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `x`th index is `n` and all other indices are 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3. If the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.***
