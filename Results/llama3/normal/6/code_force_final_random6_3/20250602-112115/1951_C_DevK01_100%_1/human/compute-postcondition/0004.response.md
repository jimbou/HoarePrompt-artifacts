Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `L` is a list of three integers, `M` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list `M`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `L` and the third element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `N` is the first q elements of the sorted list `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, and the current value of `n` times `m` equals `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the values of `m`, `N`, `n`, and the relationship between `n` and `m` is maintained as `n` times `m` equals `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
