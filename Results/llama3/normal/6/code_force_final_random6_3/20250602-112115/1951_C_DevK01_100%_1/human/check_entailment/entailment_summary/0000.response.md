Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two lines of input: the first line contains three integers (n, m, and k), and the second line contains n integers representing the price per ticket for each day.

The program first sorts the prices in ascending order and then calculates the minimum cost by considering the following cases:

1.  If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (m) is equal to the total number of tickets to be bought (k), the program calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices by m and adding the additional cost due to the increase in prices.
2.  If n \* m is not equal to k, the program removes the last price from the sorted list and calculates the cost by multiplying the remaining number of tickets (mu) by the last price (w). It then adds the cost of purchasing the remaining tickets at the previous prices, considering the increase in prices.

The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for each test case, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
