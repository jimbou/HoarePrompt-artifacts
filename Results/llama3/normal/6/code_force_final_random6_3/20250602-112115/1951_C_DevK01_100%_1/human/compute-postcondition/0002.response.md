Output State: **t is at least 1, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M.**

The first line assigns a list of integers from stdin to L. The second line assigns another list of integers from stdin to M. The third line unpacks the first three elements of L into n, m, and k. The fourth line updates m to be the minimum of its current value and k. The fifth line sorts M in ascending order. The sixth line calculates q as the ceiling of k divided by m. The seventh line assigns the first q elements of the sorted M to N. The eighth line updates n to be the length of N.
