Postcondition: ***The program skips to the next iteration of the loop it is currently inside, t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is a sorted list of integers, _ is at least 2, stdin is empty. If the product of n and m equals k, then cost is the product of m and the sum of N plus the product of m squared and the product of (n-1) and n divided by 2. Otherwise, n is the length of N minus one, N has one less element, and cost is the sum of mu times w, m times the sum of the new N, m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n, and n times m times mu, where mu is k minus (n + 1) times m and w is the last element of the original N.***
