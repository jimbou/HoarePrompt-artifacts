Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the constraints of the problem. The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum number of days required to buy k tickets. It then calculates the cost of buying the tickets on each day, taking into account the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.

The program handles two cases: when the number of days is equal to the number of tickets divided by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and when it is not. In the first case, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the tickets on each day, multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, plus the sum of the increases in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days. In the second case, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the tickets on each day, multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, plus the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on the last day.

The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
