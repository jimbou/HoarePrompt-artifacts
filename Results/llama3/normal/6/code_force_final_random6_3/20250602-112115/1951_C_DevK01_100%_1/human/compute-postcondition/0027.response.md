Output State: **The loop has finished executing, t is 0, stdin is empty, and the program has printed the cost for each test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the program has processed all the test cases in the input. The variable t, which controlled the number of iterations, has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished. The standard input (stdin) is now empty, as all the test cases have been read and processed. Finally, the program has printed the cost for each test case, as calculated by the loop body.
