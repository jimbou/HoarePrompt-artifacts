Output State: **t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of t remains unchanged, still being at least 2. The list L is updated with three new integer values read from the input. The list M is sorted in ascending order. The variable n is updated to be the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M. The variable m is updated to be the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L. The variable k is updated to be the third element of L. The variable q is updated to be the ceiling of k divided by m. The list N is updated to be the first q elements of the sorted list M.
