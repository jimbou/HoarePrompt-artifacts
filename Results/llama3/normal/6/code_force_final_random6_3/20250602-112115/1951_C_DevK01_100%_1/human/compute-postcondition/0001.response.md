According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, since the loop will execute at least once, the state of `t` should be adjusted to reflect that it is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1**
