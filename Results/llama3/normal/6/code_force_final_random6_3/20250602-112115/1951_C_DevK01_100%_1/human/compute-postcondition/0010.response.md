Output State: **t is at least 1, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M. If n times m equals k, then cost is m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n minus 1, and the current value of n times m equals k. Otherwise, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M minus 1, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M with the last element removed, w is the last element of the first q elements of the sorted list M, mu is k minus (n - 1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n minus 1 plus n times m times mu, and cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code does not change any variable values, but it skips to the next iteration of the loop using the `continue` statement. Therefore, all variable values remain the same, and the only change is that the loop moves to the next iteration.
