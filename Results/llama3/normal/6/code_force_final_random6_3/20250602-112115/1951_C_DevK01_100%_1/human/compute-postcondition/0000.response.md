Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of inputs. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is now a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of inputs. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
