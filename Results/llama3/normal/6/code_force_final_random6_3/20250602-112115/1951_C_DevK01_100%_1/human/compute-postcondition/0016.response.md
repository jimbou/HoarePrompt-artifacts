The code prints the calculated cost based on the given conditions and variables.

If `n * m` equals `k`, the cost is calculated as `m` times the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-1`. Here, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `L` and the third element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, and `n` is the length of `N`.

If `n * m` does not equal `k`, the cost is calculated as `mu * w` plus `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-1` plus `n * m * mu`. Here, `mu` is `k` minus `(original n - 1) * m`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, and `n` is the length of `N`.

Since the exact values of `L`, `M`, `N`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the given conditions and variables)**
