Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the cost of purchasing tickets.

In the problem description, it is stated that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x. However, in the program, the cost is calculated as if the price increase only affects the current day, not the subsequent days.

For example, in the first test case, the program calculates the cost of purchasing 1 ticket on the third day as 4, but it does not take into account that the price per ticket for the remaining day (day 4) will be increased by 1 due to the purchase on day 3. Therefore, the correct cost of purchasing 2 tickets on day 4 should be 6 + 2 = 8, not just 6.

This incorrect calculation of cost leads to an incorrect result, making the program incorrect.
