To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t` in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it is equal to the number of iterations that have already occurred. Since the loop has executed at least once, `_` is at least 1. `t` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is at least 2. `t` remains the same, at least 2.

State: **The program skips to the next iteration of the loop it is currently inside, t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is a sorted list of integers, _ is at least 2**
