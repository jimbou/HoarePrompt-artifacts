Output State: **t is at least 1, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M minus 1, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M with the last element removed, w is the last element of the first q elements of the sorted list M, mu is k minus (n - 1) times m, cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n minus 1 plus n times m times mu.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `L` also remains unchanged. The list `M` is also unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` minus 1, as one element is removed from `N`. The value of `m` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `k` also remains the same. The value of `q` is not affected by the code. The list `N` is updated to be the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` with the last element removed. The value of `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. The value of `mu` is calculated as `k` minus `(n - 1)` times `m`. The value of `cost` is calculated as `mu` times `w` plus `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n` minus 1 plus `n` times `m` times `mu`.
