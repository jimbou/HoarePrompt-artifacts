The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M**
