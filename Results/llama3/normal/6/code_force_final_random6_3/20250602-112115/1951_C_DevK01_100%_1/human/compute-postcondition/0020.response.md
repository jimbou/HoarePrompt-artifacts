Output State: **The program skips to the next iteration of the loop it is currently inside, t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is a sorted list of integers, _ is at least 2, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The program has skipped to the next iteration of the loop it is currently inside. The variable t is still at least 2. The list L has been reassigned to a new list of three integers, which were read from the input. The list M has also been reassigned to a new list of integers, which were also read from the input, and then sorted in ascending order. The variable n is now equal to the length of the list N. The variable m is the minimum of the second and third elements of the list L. The variable k is the third element of the list L. The variable q is the ceiling of k divided by m. The list N is a sorted list of integers, which is a subset of the list M, containing the first q elements. The variable _ is still at least 2. The input buffer is now empty, as all the input values have been read and processed.
