Output State: **t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M, cost is m times the sum of the first q elements of the sorted list M plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the values of `m`, `N`, and `n`, which are derived from the initial state variables `L`, `M`, `k`, and `q`. The other variables remain unchanged.
