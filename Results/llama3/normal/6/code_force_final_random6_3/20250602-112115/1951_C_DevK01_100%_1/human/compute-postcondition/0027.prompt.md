Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of inputs. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M. If n times m equals k, then cost is m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n minus 1, and the current value of n times m equals k. Otherwise, n is the length of the first q elements of the sorted list M minus 1, N is the first q elements of the sorted list M with the last element removed, w is the last element of the first q elements of the sorted list M, mu is k minus (n - 1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n minus 1 plus n times m times mu, and cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program skips to the next iteration of the loop it is currently inside, t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is a sorted list of integers. If n * m equals k, then the cost is calculated as m times the sum of the first q elements of the sorted list M plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1. Otherwise, N has one less element than before, w is the last element of the original N, mu is k - (original n - 1) * m, and the cost is calculated as mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu. The cost is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program skips to the next iteration of the loop it is currently inside, t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is a sorted list of integers, _ is at least 2, stdin is empty. If the product of n and m equals k, then cost is the product of m and the sum of N plus the product of m squared and the product of (n-1) and n divided by 2. Otherwise, n is the length of N minus one, N has one less element, and cost is the sum of mu times w, m times the sum of the new N, m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n, and n times m times mu, where mu is k minus (n + 1) times m and w is the last element of the original N.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
