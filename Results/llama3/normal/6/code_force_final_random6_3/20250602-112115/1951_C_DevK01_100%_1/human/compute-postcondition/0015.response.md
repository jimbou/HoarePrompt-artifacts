Postcondition: **t is at least 2, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the second element of L and the third element of L, k is the third element of L, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, N is a sorted list of integers. If n * m equals k, then the cost is calculated as m times the sum of the first q elements of the sorted list M plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1. Otherwise, N has one less element than before, w is the last element of the original N, mu is k - (original n - 1) * m, and the cost is calculated as mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu.**
