Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the constraints of the concert organizers. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k. The second line contains n integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program calculates the minimum cost for each test case by first sorting the prices in ascending order. It then determines the number of days (q) required to purchase k tickets, considering the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (m). The program calculates the cost by summing the prices of the tickets purchased on each day, taking into account the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.

The program handles two cases: when the total number of tickets to be purchased (k) is a multiple of the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (m), and when it is not. In the first case, the program calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices by m and adding the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days. In the second case, the program calculates the cost by multiplying the price of the last day by the remaining number of tickets to be purchased, adding the sum of the prices of the previous days multiplied by m, and adding the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.

The program prints the calculated cost for each test case and continues this process until all test cases have been processed.

Correctness: **True**
