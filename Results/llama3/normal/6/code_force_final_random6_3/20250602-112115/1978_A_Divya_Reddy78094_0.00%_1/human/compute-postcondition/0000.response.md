The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer (the number of books Alice has), which is assigned to `t`. The number of books is between 2 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, the value of `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.

The values of the other variables are not affected, and the stdin now contains the remaining input: a list of integers (the number of pages in each book) for the current test case, and possibly more test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains a list of integers (the number of pages in each book) for the current test case, and possibly more test cases.**
