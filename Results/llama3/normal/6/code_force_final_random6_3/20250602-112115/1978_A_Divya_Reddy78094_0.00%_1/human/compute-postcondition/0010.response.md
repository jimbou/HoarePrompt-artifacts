Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`. Since `nums` was already a list of integers, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input list. The third line sorts the list `nums` in descending order. Since `nums` was already sorted in descending order, its order remains the same.

The variable `_` is not affected by the code block, so its value remains 2. The variable `t` is not affected by the code block, so its value remains an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive.

In summary, the code block updates the values of `n` and `nums`, but does not change their types. The variable `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
