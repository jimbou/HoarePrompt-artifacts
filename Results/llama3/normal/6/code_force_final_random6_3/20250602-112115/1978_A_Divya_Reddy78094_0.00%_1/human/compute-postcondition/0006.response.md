Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order**.

The initial state is not modified by the code snippet. The variable `t` remains an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1. The variable `_` remains 1. The variable `n` remains an integer. The list `nums` is sorted in descending order, but its original values are not changed. The sum of the first two elements of the list `nums` is still being printed.
