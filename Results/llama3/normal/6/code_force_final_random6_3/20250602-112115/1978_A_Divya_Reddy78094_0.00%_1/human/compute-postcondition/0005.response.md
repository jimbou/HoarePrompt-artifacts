The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the largest two numbers in the list is being printed**
