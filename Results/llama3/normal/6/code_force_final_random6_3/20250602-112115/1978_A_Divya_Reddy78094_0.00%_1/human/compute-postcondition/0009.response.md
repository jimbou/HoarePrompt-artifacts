According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` must be 2 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
