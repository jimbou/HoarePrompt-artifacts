Output State: **_ is t-1, t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the largest two numbers in the list is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `_` has reached the value of `t-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `t` times. The variable `t` is still an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, but it is now greater than or equal to 0, since the loop has finished executing. The variable `n` is still an integer, and the list `nums` is still sorted in descending order. The sum of the first two elements of the list `nums`, which are the largest two numbers in the list, is being printed.
