Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (number of books) and a list of integers (number of pages in each book). It sorts the list of pages in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest numbers (i.e., the number of pages in the two largest books). The function processes all test cases and outputs the results for each case.**
