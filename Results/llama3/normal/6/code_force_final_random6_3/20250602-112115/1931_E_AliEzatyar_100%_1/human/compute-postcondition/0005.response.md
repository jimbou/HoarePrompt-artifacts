Output State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `counter` is 0, `i` is len(num) - 1, and the last digit of `num` is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged. The last digit of `num` is still not '0'. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
