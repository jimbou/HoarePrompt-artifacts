To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the index of the last character of `num` down to the index of the first character of `num`, decrementing by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the index of the second last character of `num`. To execute the loop again, `i` should be decremented by 1.

The state of `num` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The state of `counter` is not directly related to the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `i` is the index of the third last character of `num`, `counter` is either 0, 1 or 2**
