The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last character of `num`, `num` is a string of at least 2 digits. For the loop to execute again `i` must be decreased by 1 and `num` is still a string of at least 2 digits.
State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `i` is the index of the second last character of `num`, `counter` is either 0 or 1**
