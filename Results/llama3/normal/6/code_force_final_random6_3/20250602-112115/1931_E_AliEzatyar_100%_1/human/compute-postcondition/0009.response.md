Output State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `i` is the index of the second last character of `num`, `counter` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
