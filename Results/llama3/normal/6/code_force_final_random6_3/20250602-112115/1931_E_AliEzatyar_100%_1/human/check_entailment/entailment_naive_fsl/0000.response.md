Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. It calculates the total number of digits in the list and the number of trailing zeros in each number, then simulates the game by subtracting the trailing zeros in every other number (since Anna can reverse the numbers to remove trailing zeros). The program then checks if the resulting total number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, which determines the winner of the game.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `n` or `m` is 1. The use of the `func_1` function to count the trailing zeros in each number is also correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
