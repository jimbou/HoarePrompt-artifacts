The code increments the value of `counter` by 1. Since `counter` is either 0 or 1, its new value will be either 1 or 2. The values of `num` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `i` is the index of the second last character of `num`, `counter` is either 1 or 2.**
