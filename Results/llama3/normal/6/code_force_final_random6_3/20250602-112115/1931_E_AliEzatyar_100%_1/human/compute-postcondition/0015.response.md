Output State: **`num` is a string of digits, `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, and the value of `counter` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`.
