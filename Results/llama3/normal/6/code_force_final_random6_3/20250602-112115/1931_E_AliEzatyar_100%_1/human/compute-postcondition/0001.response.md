The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`. If num has at least 2 digits, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, num is a string of digits and counter is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `num` is a string of at least 2 digits and i is now len(num) - 1.
State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `counter` is 0, `i` is len(num) - 1**
