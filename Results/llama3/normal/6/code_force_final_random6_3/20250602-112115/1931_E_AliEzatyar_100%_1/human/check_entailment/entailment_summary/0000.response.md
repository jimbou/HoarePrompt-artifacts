Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the input array.
2. It identifies the trailing zeros in each number and stores them in the `zeros` list.
3. The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order to prioritize the numbers with the most trailing zeros.
4. The program then iterates over the `zeros` list, subtracting the trailing zeros from the total digit count in steps of 2 (since Anna and Sasha take turns). This effectively simulates the game, where Anna reverses the numbers and Sasha concatenates them.
5. Finally, the program checks if the resulting total digit count is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

The execution summary confirms that the `func_1` function correctly counts the trailing zeros in a given string of digits, which is a crucial part of the program's logic.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
