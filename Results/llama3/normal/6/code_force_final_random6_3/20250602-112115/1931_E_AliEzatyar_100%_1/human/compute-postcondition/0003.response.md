The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `counter` was 0, so the new value of `counter` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `num` is still a string of at least 2 digits, `i` is still the index of the last character of `num`, and the current value of `num[i]` is still '0'.

Output State: **`num` is a string of at least 2 digits, `counter` is 1, `i` is the index of the last character of `num`, and the current value of `num[i]` is '0'.**
