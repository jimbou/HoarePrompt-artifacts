Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the array and the number of trailing zeros in each element.
3. The program correctly sorts the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracts every other zero from the total count.
4. The program correctly checks if the absolute difference between the total digits and the subtracted zeros is greater than or equal to m + 1. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
5. The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

The function `func_1` is also correct. It correctly counts and returns the number of trailing zeros in a given string of digits.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
