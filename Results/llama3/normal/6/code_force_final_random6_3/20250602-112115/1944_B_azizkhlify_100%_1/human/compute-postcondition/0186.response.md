Based on the given initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `i`: The third element in the list `res`.
* `res`: A list containing at least 3 elements of `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
* `a`: A list of `n` integers.
* `l`: A list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0.
* `n`: A positive integer.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(i, end=' ')`

The print statement prints the value of `i`, which is the third element in the list `res`. Since `res` contains elements of `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, we can infer that `i` is an element of `a` that satisfies this condition.

However, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without knowing the specific values of `a`, `l`, and `n`. But we can describe the output as:

Output: **The third element of `res`, which is an element of `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1**
