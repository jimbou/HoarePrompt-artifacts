The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`, where `i` is equal to 1. Since `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of the list `a` will be printed. The value of this element is not explicitly provided, but it is described as an integer in the list `a`. The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space will be printed after the element, rather than a newline.

Output: **the element at index 1 of the list a (which is an integer), followed by a space**
