State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is 0. If l[a[i] - 1] == 1, then res is a list containing the element at index i of the list a and i is 1. Otherwise, res is an empty list and i remains 0. If the current value of re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
