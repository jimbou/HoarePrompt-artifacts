The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Here, `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and `i` is currently 0. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, we can infer that `a[i]` is 1 (because `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which means `a[i]` must be 1 to satisfy the condition `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2). Therefore, the output will be the value 1 printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **1 1**
