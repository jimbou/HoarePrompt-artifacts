Output State: **The loop prints all elements in the list `res` separated by a space, and the loop terminates.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will continue to execute until it has printed all elements in the list `res`. The loop will print each element in `res` separated by a space, and once it has printed all elements, the loop will terminate. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
