The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-zero value, which is either `2 * k` or `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the `i`th element of the list `a`, and `i` is less than `n` and increased by 1**
