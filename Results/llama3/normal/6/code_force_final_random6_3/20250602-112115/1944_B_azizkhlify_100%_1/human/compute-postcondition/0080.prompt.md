Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2. If `k` is not 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or k, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is a list containing the elements of a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n. If `k` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or k, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements of a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n. If `k` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. and nothing is printed, and the value of i which is n is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or k, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements of a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, the second element in the list res which is i is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or k, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements of a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1 and the list must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, the second element in the list res which is i is printed, `i` is the second element in the list res, and this is printed: the second element in the list res which is i, where i is an element of the list a and the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
