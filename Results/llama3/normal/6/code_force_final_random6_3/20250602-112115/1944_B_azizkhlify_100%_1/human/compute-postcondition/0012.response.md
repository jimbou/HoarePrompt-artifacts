Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[n] - 1 is 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is n+1**

In this output state, the value of `r` at index `a[n] - 1` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
