Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
