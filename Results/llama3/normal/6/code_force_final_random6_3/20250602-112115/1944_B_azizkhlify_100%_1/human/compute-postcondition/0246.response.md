Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ur is either 0 or 2, res is an empty list, and i is 1. If the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 2, then the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l is updated to 0 and ur is set to 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
