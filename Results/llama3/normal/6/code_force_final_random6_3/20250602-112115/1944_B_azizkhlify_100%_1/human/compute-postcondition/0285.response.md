Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, and `i` is n. If k is not zero, `res` is a list containing the elements at indices i of the list a where l[a[i] - 1] == 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list. and nothing is printed**
