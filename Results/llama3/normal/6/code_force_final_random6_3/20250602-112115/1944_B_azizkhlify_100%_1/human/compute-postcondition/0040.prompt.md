Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2n-1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `r` will have a value of `n` at the index `a[2n-1] - 1`, and the rest of the elements in `r` will be 0. The value of `i` will be `2n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, re is 0, ur is either 0 or 2, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, if ul equals k * 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[2n-1] - 1` is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then the value at that index is updated to 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
