Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, re is 0, ur is either 0 or 2, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, if ul equals k * 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
