The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end. Here, `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is 1.

Since `i` is 1, the code will print the second element of the list `a` (because indexing starts at 0) twice.

Output: **the second element of the list a, the second element of the list a**
