Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, re is 0, ur is 2, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` has been changed to 0, and the value of `ur` has been incremented by 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `a[i]` is printed twice separated by a space.
