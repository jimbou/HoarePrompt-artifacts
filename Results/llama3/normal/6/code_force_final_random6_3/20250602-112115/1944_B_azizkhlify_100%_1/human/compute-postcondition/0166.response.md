Postcondition: ***`ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-zero value, which is either `2 * k` or `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the `i`th element of the list `a`, and `i` is less than `n` and increased by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the `i`th element of the list `a` is printed, and `re` is increased by 1. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
