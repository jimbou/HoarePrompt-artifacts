The code prints the `i`th element of the list `a`, where `i` is a positive integer less than `n` and is increased by 1. The value of `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a` containing `n` integers.

Output: **the ith element of the list a (where i is a positive integer less than n and is increased by 1)**
