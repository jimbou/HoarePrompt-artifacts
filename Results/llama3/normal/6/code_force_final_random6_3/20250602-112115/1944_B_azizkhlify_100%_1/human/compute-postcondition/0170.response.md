Output State: **ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-zero value, which is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, res is a list containing the ith element of the list a, and i is less than n and increased by 1, and the ith element of the list a which is an integer is printed followed by a space, re is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `re` has been incremented by 1, and the `i`th element of the list `a` has been appended to the list `res`. The value of `i` has also been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
