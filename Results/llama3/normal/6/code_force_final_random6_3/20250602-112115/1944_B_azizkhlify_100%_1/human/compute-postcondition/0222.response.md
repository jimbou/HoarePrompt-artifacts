Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 1 and the element at index `a[i] - 1` is 2 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` ones, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated such that the element at index `a[i] - 1` is now 2, while the rest of the elements remain the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
