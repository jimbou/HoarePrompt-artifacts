The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.
Since `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 more than the last valid index of the list `a`. Therefore, `a[i]` is out of range of the list `a`, and this will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception.
Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
