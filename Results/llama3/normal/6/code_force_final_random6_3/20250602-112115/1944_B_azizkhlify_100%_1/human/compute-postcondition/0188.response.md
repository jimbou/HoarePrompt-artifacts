Output State: **ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, res is a list containing all elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and i is equal to the last element in res. All elements in res have been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements in the list `res` have been printed, and the loop variable `i` is equal to the last element in `res`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
