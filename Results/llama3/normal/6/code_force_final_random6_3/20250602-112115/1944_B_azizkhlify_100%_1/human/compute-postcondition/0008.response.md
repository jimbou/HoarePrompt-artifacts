Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n zeros, re is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n - 1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` will have 1s at the indices corresponding to the values in list `a` minus 1, and the rest of the elements will be 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, which is the last index of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
