Postcondition: ***ul is 2 if l[a[i] - 1] is 2, otherwise ul is 0. ur is 0. n is a positive integer. k is an integer. a is a list of n integers. l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 if l[a[i] - 1] was 2, otherwise l[a[i] - 1] is n, and the rest are 0. r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1. re is 0. res is an empty list. stdin contains no input. i is 0. If l[a[i] - 1] was 2, the first element of the list a which is a[0] is printed twice with a space in between.***
