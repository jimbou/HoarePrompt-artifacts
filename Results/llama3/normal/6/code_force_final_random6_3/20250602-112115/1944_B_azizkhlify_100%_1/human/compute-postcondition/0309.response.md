Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is 0 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 2 or a multiple of 4, i is n + 1, and res is a list containing all elements.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as an integer equal to 2 times itself minus `ul`. The list `a` remains unchanged with `n` integers. The list `l` remains unchanged with `n` integers, where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2. The list `r` has been modified such that the element at index `a[i] - 1` is now 0, and all other elements are 1. The value of `ul` remains unchanged as either 0 or a multiple of 2. The value of `ur` has been incremented by 2, making it either 2 or a multiple of 4. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n + 1`. The list `res` remains unchanged, containing all elements.
