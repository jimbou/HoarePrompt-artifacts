Output: **ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, n is a positive integer, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or n and the rest are 1, res is a list containing all elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and i is equal to 2 * n if ul is not equal to ur, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and nothing is printed**
