Output State: **i is n + 1, n is greater than 0, r[a[n+1] - 1] is 0, ur is increased by 2, a[n+1] is printed twice**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as `n + 1`. The value of `n` also remains the same, which is greater than 0. The value of `r[a[n+1] - 1]` is now 0, as assigned by the first line of code. The value of `ur` is increased by 2, as per the second line of code. Additionally, the value of `a[n+1]` is printed twice, as specified in the initial state.
