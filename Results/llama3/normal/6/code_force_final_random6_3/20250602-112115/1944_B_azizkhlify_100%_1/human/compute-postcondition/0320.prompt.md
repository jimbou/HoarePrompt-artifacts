Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, and `res` is a list containing all elements, and all elements of the list `res` are printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 0 or 2, i is n, and res is a list containing all elements, and all elements of the list res are printed. If ul is equal to ur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 0 or 2, i is n + 1, and res is a list containing all elements. If ul is equal to ur, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than n + 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `i` is n + 2, and `res` is a list containing all elements. If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
