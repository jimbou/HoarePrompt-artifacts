Output: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 0 or 2, i is n + 1, and res is a list containing all elements, and the following is printed: the element at index i of the list a which is a[i], and the element at index i of the list a which is a[i], and these are printed with a space in between, and the program continues to execute if ul is not equal to ur, otherwise it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
