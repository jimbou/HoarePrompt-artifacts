Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2 and the current value of k is not 0, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, re is either 0 or 1, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2, res is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 1, and if the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then the first element of the list a is being printed. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then the first element of the list a is being printed and the value of a[i] is being printed, and res is a list containing the first element of a and the element at index i of a, otherwise, no changes are made.**
