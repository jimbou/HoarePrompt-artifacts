Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated, `i` is n, `n` must be greater than 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[n]` was printed twice separated by a space, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` was increased by 2. Otherwise, no additional changes were made. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are either equal or not equal. If they are equal, the loop has terminated and the above conditions are met. If they are not equal, the loop has terminated, and the initial conditions are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[n+1] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and `a[n+1]` is printed twice. Otherwise, no changes are made, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *i is n + 2, n is greater than 0. If ul equals ur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if r[a[n + 2] - 1] is 2, then r[a[n + 2] - 1] is set to 0, ur is increased by 2, and a[n + 2] is printed twice, separated by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
