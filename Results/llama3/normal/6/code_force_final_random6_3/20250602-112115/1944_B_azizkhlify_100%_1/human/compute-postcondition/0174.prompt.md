Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-zero value, which is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 if l[a[i] - 1] was 2, otherwise l[a[i] - 1] is n, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, re is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains no input, and i is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-zero value, which is either `2 * k` or `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the `i`th element of the list `a`, and `i` is less than `n`. If `re` is equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-zero value, which is either `2 * k` or `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the `i`th element of the list `a`, and `i` is less than `n` and increased by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the `i`th element of the list `a` is printed, and `re` is increased by 1. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-zero value, which is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, res is either an empty list or a list containing the ith element of the list a, and i is less than n and increased by 1. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
