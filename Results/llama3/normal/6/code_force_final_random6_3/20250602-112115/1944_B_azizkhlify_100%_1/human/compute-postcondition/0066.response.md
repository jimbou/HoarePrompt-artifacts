Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2 and the current value of k is not 0, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 2. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then re is 1, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2, and res is a list containing the first element of a and the 3rd element of a. Otherwise, the values of re, ul, ur, and res remain unchanged.***
