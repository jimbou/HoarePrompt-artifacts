To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which is greater than `n` but less than `2 * n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is n and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input, `i` is n + 2**
