Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, res is a list containing all elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and i is equal to the last element in res. All elements in res have been printed. The current value of ul is not equal to the current value of ur.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `k` is either 2 * `k` or 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or `n` and the rest are 1, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, `ur` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `ul` is equal to `ur`, or continues execution when `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, maintaining the values of `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `res`, and `i` as specified in the precondition, with `ur` being 2 when `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and 0 otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ul` is unknown, `ur` is either 0, 2, or 4, `n` is unknown, `k` is unknown, `a` is unknown, `l` is unknown, `r` is modified at index `a[i] - 1` to 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise remains unchanged, `res` is unknown, and `i` is `2 * n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the value of `a` at index `i` which is `2 * n` is printed if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
