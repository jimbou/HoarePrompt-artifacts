The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. The precondition states that `a` is a list of `n` integers, but it does not specify the exact values of these integers.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the list `a`, printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[first element of list a] [first element of list a]**
