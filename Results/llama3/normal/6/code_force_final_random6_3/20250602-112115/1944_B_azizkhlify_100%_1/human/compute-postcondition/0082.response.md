The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated, and the current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now n.
State: **The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated, the current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `i` is n,  `n` must be greater than 0**
