The code prints the value of `a[i]`, which is the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is less than `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, the printed value will be one of the integers in the list `a`. The `end=' '` argument in the print function means that a space will be printed after the value of `a[i]`, so that the next output will be printed on the same line.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the i-th element of the list a)**
