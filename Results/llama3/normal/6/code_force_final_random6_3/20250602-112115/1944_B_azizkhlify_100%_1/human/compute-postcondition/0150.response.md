Postcondition: **ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-zero value, which is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 if l[a[i] - 1] was 2, otherwise l[a[i] - 1] is n, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, re is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains no input, and i is n.**
