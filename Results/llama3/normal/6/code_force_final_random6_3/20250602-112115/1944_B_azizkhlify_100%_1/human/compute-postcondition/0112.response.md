Output State: **`ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, where `a[i]` is the value of the `i-th` element in the list `a`. The rest of the elements in the list `l` remain 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
