Output State: **i is n + 2, n is greater than 0, r[a[n + 2] - 1] is 0, ur is increased by 2, a[n + 2] is printed twice, separated by a space**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `i` remains `n + 2`, and `n` is still greater than 0. The code modifies the list `r` by setting the element at index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Since `i` is `n + 2`, this means the element at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in list `r` is now 0. The variable `ur` is incremented by 2. The output remains the same, with `a[n + 2]` printed twice, separated by a space.
