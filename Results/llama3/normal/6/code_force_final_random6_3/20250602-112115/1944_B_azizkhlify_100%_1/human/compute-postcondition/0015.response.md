Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2n-1

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `r` and `i`. The value of `r` at index a[2n-1] - 1 is now n, and the value of `i` is now 2n-1.
