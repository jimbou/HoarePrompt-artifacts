Output State: **`ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i` are as initially described in the precondition. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is 4, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is 4 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0. The code only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing the values of any variables.
