The code prints the second element in the list `res`, which is `i`. The list `res` contains the elements of `a` where the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1. Since `res` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `res`.

Output: **the second element in the list res (which is the second element in the list a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1)**
