Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect their values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The condition that `n` is greater than 0 is still valid, and `i` is still equal to `n + 2`.
