Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is n. The current value of `k` is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is 0. If l[a[i] - 1] == 1, then res is a list containing the element at index i of the list a and i is 1. Otherwise, res is an empty list and i remains 0. If the current value of re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is 0. If re is equal to k, then if l[a[i] - 1] == 1, res is a list containing the element at index i of the list a, i is 1, re is equal to k + 1, and the element at index i of the list a is being printed. Otherwise, res is an empty list and i remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If re is not equal to k, then the program continues without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is 0. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the element at index a[i] - 1 of the list l is 1, then the element at index i of the list a which is a[i] is being printed, and the element at index i of the list a which is a[i] is appended to the list res, and re is equal to k + 2. No changes are made if the element at index a[i] - 1 of the list l is not 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
