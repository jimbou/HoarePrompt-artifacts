Postcondition: ***`ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i` are as initially described in the precondition. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is 4, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.***
