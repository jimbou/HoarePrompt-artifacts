Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is `i + 1` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is 2 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated such that the element at index `a[i] - 1` is now 2, while all other elements remain 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
