Based on the initial state, the code will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `i` is increased by 1, so its new value is `i + 1`.
2. `n` is greater than `i`, which means `i` is still within the bounds of the array `a`.
3. `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the array `a`.
4. The `print` statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, using the `end=' '` argument to suppress the newline character.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the array a, and i is the current value of i, which is i + 1)**
