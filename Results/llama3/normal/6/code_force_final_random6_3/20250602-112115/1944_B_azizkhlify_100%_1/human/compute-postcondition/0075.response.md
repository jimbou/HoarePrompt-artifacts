The code prints the second element in the list `res`, which contains the elements of `a` where the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1. Since `i` is the second element in the list `res`, it will print the second element of `a` that satisfies the condition.

Output: **the second element of a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1**
