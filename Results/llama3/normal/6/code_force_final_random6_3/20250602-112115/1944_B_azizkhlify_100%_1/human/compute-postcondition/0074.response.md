State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or k, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements of a where the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the second element in the list res**
