The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2*n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[n] - 1 is 1 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is n+1**
