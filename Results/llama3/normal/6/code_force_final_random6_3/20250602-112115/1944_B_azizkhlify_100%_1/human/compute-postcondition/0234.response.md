Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is `i + 1` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is `n + 1` and all other elements are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is 0. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2***
