The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `n+2`, and `a` is a list of integers. The value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is 2, and the rest are 0. Therefore, the value at index `a[n+2] - 1` in list `r` is now 3, and the rest are 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[n+2] - 1 is 3 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is n+2**
