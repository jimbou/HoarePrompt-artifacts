Output State: **`ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is n and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 3 and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input, `i` is n + 2**

In this output state, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `r[a[i] - 1]` being 3, while the rest of the elements in the list `r` remain 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
