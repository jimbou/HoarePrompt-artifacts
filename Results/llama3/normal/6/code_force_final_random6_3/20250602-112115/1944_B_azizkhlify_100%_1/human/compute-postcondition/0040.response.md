Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `r` will have a value of `n` at the index `a[2n-1] - 1`, and the rest of the elements in `r` will be 0. The value of `i` will be `n`. The value of `ul` will be either 0 or `k * 2`, depending on whether the loop broke out early or not. The value of `ur` will be either 0 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
