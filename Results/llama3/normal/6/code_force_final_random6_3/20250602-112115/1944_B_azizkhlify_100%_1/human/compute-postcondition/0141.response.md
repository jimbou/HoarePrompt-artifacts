The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is as initially described in the precondition, `n` is as initially described in the precondition. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i` is `i` increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`**
