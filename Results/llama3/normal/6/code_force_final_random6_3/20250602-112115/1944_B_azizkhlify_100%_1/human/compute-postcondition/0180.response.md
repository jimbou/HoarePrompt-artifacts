The code prints the value of `i`, which is an element in the list `res`. The list `res` contains at least one element of `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. This means that `i` is an element of `a` that has a corresponding value of 1 in the list `l`.

Since `l` is a list of n integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, the value of `i` is an index in the list `a` that corresponds to a 1 in the list `l`.

The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space will be printed after the value of `i`, rather than a newline character.

Output: **an element of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, followed by a space**
