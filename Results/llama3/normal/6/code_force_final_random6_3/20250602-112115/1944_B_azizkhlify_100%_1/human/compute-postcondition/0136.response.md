Output: **`ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `l[a[i] - 1]` is `n`, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is 1, and this is printed: a[i] which is the second element of the list `a` (a[1]) and a[i] which is the second element of the list `a` (a[1])**
