Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 0 or 2, i is n + 1, and res is a list containing all elements. If the element at index a[i] - 1 in the list r is 2, then the element at index a[i] - 1 in the list r is updated to 0 and ur is updated to either 2 or a multiple of 4. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
