The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `2 * n`. So `n` is still a positive integer.
State: **`ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is n and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input, `i` is n + 1**
