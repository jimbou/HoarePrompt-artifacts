Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2 and the current value of k is not 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is equal to k, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
