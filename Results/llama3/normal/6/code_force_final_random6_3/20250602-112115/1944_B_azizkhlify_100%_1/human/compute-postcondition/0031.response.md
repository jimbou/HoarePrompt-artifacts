Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The initial state of the variables remains the same, and we are now outside the most internal loop or if statement.
