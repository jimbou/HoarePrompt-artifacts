Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, and `i` is n. If k is not zero, `res` is a list containing the elements at indices i of the list a where l[a[i] - 1] == 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list. and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `res`, and `res` is a list containing at least 1 element, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list `res`, and `res` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and this is printed: i (where i is the second element in the list `res`) followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is the third element in the list `res`, and `res` is a list containing at least 3 elements, and the third element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
