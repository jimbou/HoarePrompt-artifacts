Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to either twice its original value or twice its original value minus twice the value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
