Postcondition: ***The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated, the current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `i` is n,  `n` must be greater than 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[n]` is printed twice separated by a space, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
