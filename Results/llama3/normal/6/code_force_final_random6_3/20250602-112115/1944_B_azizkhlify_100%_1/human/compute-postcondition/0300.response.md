Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is n, and `res` is a list containing all elements, and all elements of the list `res` are printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`. The current value of `r` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2. and the following is printed: a[i] which is equal to a[n] (where n is the value of n), a[i] which is equal to a[n] (where n is the value of n)**
