The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is 0, so for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
State: **`ul` and `ur` are equal, a newline is printed, `int(input())` is greater than 0**
