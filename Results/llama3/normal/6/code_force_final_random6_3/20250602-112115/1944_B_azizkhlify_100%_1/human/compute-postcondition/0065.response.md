Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2 and the current value of k is not 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then re is 1, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2, and res is a list containing the first element of a and the 3rd element of a. Otherwise, the values of re, ul, ur, and res remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the loop or if statement.
