Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 0 or 2, i is n, and res is a list containing all elements, and all elements of the list res are printed. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the current value of ur is 2 and the current value of r at index a[i] - 1 is 0, and a[i] which is equal to a[n] (where n is the value of n) is printed twice. Otherwise, the current value of ur is 0.***
