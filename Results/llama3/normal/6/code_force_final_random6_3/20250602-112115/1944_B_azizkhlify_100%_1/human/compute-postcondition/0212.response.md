Postcondition: ***`ul` is unknown, `ur` is either 0, 2, or 4, `n` is unknown, `k` is unknown, `a` is unknown, `l` is unknown, `r` is modified at index `a[i] - 1` to 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise remains unchanged, `res` is unknown, and `i` is `2 * n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the value of `a` at index `i` which is `2 * n` is printed if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, no changes are made.***
