The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is equal to `n + 2`, which is greater than `n`, it is out of the bounds of the list `a` which has `n` elements. In Python, when you try to access an index that is out of range, it raises an `IndexError`.

However, since the problem statement asks us to determine exactly what will be printed when the statement executes, and given the precondition that `i` is `n + 2`, we can conclude that the code will raise an `IndexError` exception.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
