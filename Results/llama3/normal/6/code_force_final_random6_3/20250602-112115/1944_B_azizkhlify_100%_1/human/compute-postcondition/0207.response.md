The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, with a space in between, without starting a new line due to the `end=' '` argument.

Since `i` is equal to `2 * n`, the index of the element being printed is twice the value of `n`.

Output: **a[2n] a[2n] (where a[2n] is the element at index 2n of the list a)**
