Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `ul` is equal to `ur`, or continues execution when `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, maintaining the values of `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `res`, and `i` as specified in the precondition, with `ur` being 2 when `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and 0 otherwise.**
