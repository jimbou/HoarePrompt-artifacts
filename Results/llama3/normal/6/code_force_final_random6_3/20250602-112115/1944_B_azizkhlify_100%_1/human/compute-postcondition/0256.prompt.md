Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is `i + 1` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is `n + 1` and all other elements are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ur is 0, res is an empty list, and i is 0. If ul is equal to k * 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ur is either 0 or 2, res is an empty list, and i is 1. If ul is equal to k * 2, then if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 2, the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l is updated to 0 and ur is set to 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If ul is not equal to k * 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ur is either 0 or 2, res is an empty list, and i is 2. If ul equals k * 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l[a[2] - 1] equals 2, then the element at index a[2] - 1 in l is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
