Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ul is 0, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, re is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains no input, i is 2n-1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, or continues execution with the same state as before the if statement, where `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `l[a[i] - 1]` is `n`, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i` are as initially described in the precondition. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ul` is 4, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `k` times 2, then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *ul, ur, n, k, a, l, r, re, res, stdin, and i are variables. If l at index a[i] - 1 is 2, then ul is increased by 2, l at index a[i] - 1 is 0, n is greater than i, i is increased by 1, a at index i is printed twice with a space in between, and ur, k, r, re, res, and stdin remain unchanged. If ul is equal to k times 2, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
