The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - k * 2 and the current value of k is not 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[2n-1] - 1 is n and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or 1, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2**
