Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[n+1] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and `a[n+1]` is printed twice. Otherwise, no changes are made, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then no changes are made.***
