Output State: **The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated, the current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `i` is n,  `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[n]` is printed twice separated by a space, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2.**

In this final state, the loop has already printed all elements in the list `res` and has terminated. The values of `ul` and `ur` are still not equal. The value of `i` remains `n`, and `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `a[i]`, which is equal to `a[n]`, has been printed twice separated by a space. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` has been updated to 0. Finally, the value of `ur` has been increased by 2.
