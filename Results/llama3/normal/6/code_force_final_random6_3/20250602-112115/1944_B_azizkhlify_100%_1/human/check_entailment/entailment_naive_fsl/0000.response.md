Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is equal to n/2 and there are no pairs of identical numbers in the first half of the array. In this case, the program will not be able to find enough numbers to fill the left array and will not produce the correct output.

For example, if the input is:

4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

The program will not be able to find two pairs of identical numbers in the first half of the array, and will not produce the correct output.
