Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output: *ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is 0, n is a positive integer, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, res is a list containing all elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and i is equal to n. If k is non-zero, the program continues to execute. If k is zero, the program does nothing. Nothing is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, `res` is a list containing at least 1 element of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and `i` is an element in `res`, and this is printed: an element in `res` which is an element in `a` where l[a[i] - 1] is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, `res` is a list containing at least 2 elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and `i` is the second element in `res`, and the second element in `res` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, `ur` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 1, `res` is a list containing at least 3 elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and `i` is the third element in `res`, and the third element in `res` which is `i` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
