To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 2`. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 0**
