Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are equal, and a newline is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, ur is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to k * 2, n is a positive integer, k is either 2 * k or 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or n and the rest are 1, res is a list containing all elements of a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and i is equal to 2 * n if ul is not equal to ur, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or n + 1 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, and `res` is a list containing all elements, nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
