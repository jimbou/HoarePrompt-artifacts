Output: **n is a positive integer greater than n + 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is either 0 or 2, i is n + 2, and res is a list containing all elements, and the following is printed: the element at index i of the list a which is out of range because i is greater than the length of the list a, and the same element is printed again, separated by a space**
