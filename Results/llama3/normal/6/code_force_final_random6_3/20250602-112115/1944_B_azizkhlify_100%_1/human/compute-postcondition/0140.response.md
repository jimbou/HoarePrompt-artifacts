Postcondition: ***`ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i` are as initially described in the precondition. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ul` is 4, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `k` times 2, then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.***
