Postcondition: ***The loop has printed all elements in the list `res` separated by a space and has terminated, `i` is n, `n` must be greater than 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[n]` was printed twice separated by a space, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` was increased by 2. Otherwise, no additional changes were made. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are either equal or not equal. If they are equal, the loop has terminated and the above conditions are met. If they are not equal, the loop has terminated, and the initial conditions are met. ***
