Postcondition: ***ul, ur, n, k, a, l, r, re, res, stdin, and i are variables. If l at index a[i] - 1 is 2, then ul is increased by 2, l at index a[i] - 1 is 0, n is greater than i, i is increased by 1, a at index i is printed twice with a space in between, and ur, k, r, re, res, and stdin remain unchanged. If ul is equal to k times 2, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.***
