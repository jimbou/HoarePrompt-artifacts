Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 or 2, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[i] - 1 is n + 1 and all other elements are 1, ul is either 0 or a multiple of 2, ur is 0. If the element at index a[i] - 1 of the list l is 1, then the element at index i of the list a which is a[i] is being printed, and the element at index i of the list a which is a[i] is appended to the list res, and re is equal to k + 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
