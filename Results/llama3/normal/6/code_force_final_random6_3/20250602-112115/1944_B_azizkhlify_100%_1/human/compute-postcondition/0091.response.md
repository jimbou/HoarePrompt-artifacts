To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute again, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables mentioned in the state, such as `res`, `a`, `r`, `ul`, and `ur`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0**
