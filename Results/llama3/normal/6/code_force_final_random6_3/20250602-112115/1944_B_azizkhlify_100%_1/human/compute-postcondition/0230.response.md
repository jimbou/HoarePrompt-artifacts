The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is `n + 2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is `i + 1` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is 3 and all other elements are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is `n + 2**
