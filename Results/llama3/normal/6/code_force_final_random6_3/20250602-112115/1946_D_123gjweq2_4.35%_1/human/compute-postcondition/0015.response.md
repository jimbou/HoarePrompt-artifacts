Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element in cur_arr, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, thing1 is 0, xor is 0, new_arr is a list that contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and i.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been reset to 0, and a new list `new_arr` has been created with the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`. The values of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `x`, and `thing1` remain unchanged.
