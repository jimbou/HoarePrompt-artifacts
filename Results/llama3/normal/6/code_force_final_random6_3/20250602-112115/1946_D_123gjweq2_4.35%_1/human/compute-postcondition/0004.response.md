To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur_arr`. The loop will execute if `cur_arr` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cur_arr` to have at least one element, and `i` should be the first element in `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0**
