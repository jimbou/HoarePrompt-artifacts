Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0. If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor` is `xor` XOR `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been updated to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the bit-th bit of `xor` and its effect on `new_arr` still holds, but now `xor` has a new value that is the result of the XOR operation.
