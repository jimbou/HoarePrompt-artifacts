Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30 and the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 1, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 1 at the bit position `bit`. If the current value of `xor` has a 1 at the bit position `bit`, then the current value of `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, the current value of `thing1` is the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.***
