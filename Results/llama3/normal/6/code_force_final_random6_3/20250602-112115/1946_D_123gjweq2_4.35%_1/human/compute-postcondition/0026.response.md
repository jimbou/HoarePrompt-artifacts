Output State: **The program returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.**

Explanation:
Since `cur_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 1 at the bit position `bit`, which is 0. Therefore, `thing1` is not -1.

`thing1` is the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. Since `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `cur_arr` is empty, `new_arr` is also empty. Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1` is 0.

However, since the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, it is possible that there are elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. In this case, the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1` is not necessarily 0.

Therefore, the program returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.
