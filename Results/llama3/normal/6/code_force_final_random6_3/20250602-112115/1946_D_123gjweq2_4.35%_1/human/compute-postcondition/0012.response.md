Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0. If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor` is `xor` XOR `i`.***
