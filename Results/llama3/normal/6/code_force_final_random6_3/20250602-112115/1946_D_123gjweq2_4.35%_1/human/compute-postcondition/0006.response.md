Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is equal to the first element in `cur_arr` and the current value of `xor` is such that the bit at position `bit` is 0, and `thing1` is 0***
