Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in cur_arr, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr, xor is 0, and thing1 is 0**

In this output state, the code has appended the initial value of `xor` (which is the first element of `cur_arr`) to `new_arr`, and then set `xor` to 0. The values of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `x`, and `thing1` remain unchanged.
