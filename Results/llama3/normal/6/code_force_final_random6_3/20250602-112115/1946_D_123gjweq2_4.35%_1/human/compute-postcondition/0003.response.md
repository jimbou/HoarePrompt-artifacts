Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0, and thing1 is 0.**

The code initializes three new variables: `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1`. The first line creates an empty list and assigns it to `new_arr`. The second line sets `xor` to 0. The third line sets `thing1` to 0. None of the existing variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x`) are modified by this code block.
