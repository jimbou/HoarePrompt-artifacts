This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between elements in the input list `cur_arr`, considering the bit position `bit` and the value `x`. It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1, otherwise it recursively finds the maximum XOR value by splitting the list into two parts based on the bit position `bit` and then returns either the maximum value, the length of the new list, or -1 depending on the value of `x` and the bit position.
