Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`**.

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the value of `i`, which is the third element in the list `cur_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
