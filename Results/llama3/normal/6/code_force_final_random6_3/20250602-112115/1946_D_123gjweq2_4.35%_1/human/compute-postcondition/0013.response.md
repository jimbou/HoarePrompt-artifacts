To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in cur_arr:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `cur_arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, and `cur_arr` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `cur_arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in `cur_arr`.

The other variables `bit`, `x`, `thing1`, `new_arr`, and `xor` are not part of the loop head, so their states cannot be adjusted.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0**
