Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 1 at the bit position `bit`, and `thing1` is 0. The current value of `xor` has a 1 at the bit position `bit`.***
