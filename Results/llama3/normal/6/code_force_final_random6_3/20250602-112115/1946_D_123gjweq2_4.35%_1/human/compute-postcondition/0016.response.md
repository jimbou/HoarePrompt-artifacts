Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0. If the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i` is 0 at the bit position `bit`, then `xor` is 0 and `new_arr` is a list that contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
