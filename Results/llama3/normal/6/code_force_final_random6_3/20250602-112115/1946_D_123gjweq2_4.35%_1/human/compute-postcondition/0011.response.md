Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in cur_arr, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, thing1 is 0, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr and the value of xor before the code execution, xor is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `new_arr` has been updated to include the value of `xor` before the code execution, and the value of `xor` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
