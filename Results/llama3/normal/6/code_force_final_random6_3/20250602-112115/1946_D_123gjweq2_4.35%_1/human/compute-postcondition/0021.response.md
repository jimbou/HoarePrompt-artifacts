Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 1 at the bit position `bit`, and `thing1` is the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been updated to be the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. This is because the `find_max` function is called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, and its result is assigned to `thing1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
