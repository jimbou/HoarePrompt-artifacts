Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 1 at the bit position `bit`, and `thing1` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state is as follows:

*   `cur_arr` is an empty list because the loop iterates over all elements in `cur_arr`.
*   `i` is not defined because the loop variable `i` is only defined within the loop.
*   `bit` remains unchanged as an integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive).
*   `x` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer less than 2^30.
*   `new_arr` contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`. This is because the loop appends the result of the XOR operation to `new_arr` whenever the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0.
*   `xor` contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the initial `cur_arr` that have a 1 at the bit position `bit`. This is because the loop updates `xor` with the XOR of `xor` and `i` whenever the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1.
*   `thing1` remains unchanged as 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
