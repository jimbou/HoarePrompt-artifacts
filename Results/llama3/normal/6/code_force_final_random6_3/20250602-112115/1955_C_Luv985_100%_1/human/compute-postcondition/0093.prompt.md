Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, the first and last elements of list a are decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. If the first element of list a is 0, then l is 1, and ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1. Otherwise, l is 0, and ans is 1 if a[r] is not 0, otherwise ans is 2. If a[r] is 0, then r is n - 2. Otherwise, r is n - 1. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[0] - t - k // 2 == 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0. In both cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r can be either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by twice the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, and the lth and rth elements of list a are decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of the original list a. If a[l] is equal to 0, then l is either 1 or 2 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r can be either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2 or 3. If a[r] is equal to 0, then the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r must be at least n - 1, ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, mi is the minimum of the lth and rth elements of list a. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased, the lth and rth elements of list a are decreased by mi, and ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. If the lth element of list a is 0, then l is either 1 or 2 and if l is 2, then r must be greater than 2, otherwise r must be at least n - 1, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, mi is the minimum of the lth and rth elements of list a, stdin contains T - 3 test cases. If a[r] is 0, then ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
