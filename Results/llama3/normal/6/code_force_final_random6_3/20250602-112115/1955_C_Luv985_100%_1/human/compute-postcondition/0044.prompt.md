Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[0] is reduced by mi, a[n-1] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by twice the value of mi. If a[0] is equal to 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and the current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, or a[l]. If a[r] is equal to 0, then the current value of l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, or a[l]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then after the subtraction of mi from a[l] and a[r], a[l] is less than or equal to a[r]. If a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than the minimum possible value of mi, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than r with r being greater than l even after any decrements, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decremented by the original mi, and if a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
