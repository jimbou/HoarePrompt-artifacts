Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, a[0] is reduced by mi, a[n-1] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by twice the value of mi. If a[0] is equal to 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and the current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, or a[l]. If a[r] is equal to 0, then the current value of l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, or a[l].***
