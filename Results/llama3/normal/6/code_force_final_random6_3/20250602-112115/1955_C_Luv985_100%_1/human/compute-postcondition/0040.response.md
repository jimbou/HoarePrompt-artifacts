Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than the minimum possible value of `mi`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `l` is less than `r` with `r` being greater than `l` even after any decrements, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and their relationships with each other are still valid.
