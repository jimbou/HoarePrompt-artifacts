Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `ans` is an integer, `t` is either 0 or 1, `r` is an integer, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are integers, `k` is greater than 0**

The value of `t` is assigned the remainder of `k` divided by 2. Since `k` is an integer greater than 0, the remainder of `k` divided by 2 can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the value of `t` is either 0 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.
