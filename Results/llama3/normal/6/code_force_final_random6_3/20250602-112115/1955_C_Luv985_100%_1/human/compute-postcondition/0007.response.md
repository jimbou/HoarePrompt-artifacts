Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin contains t - 1 test cases, a[0] is reduced by mi, a[n-1] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by twice the value of mi. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
