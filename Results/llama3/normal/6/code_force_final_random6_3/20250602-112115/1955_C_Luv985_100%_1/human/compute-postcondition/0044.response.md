Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than or equal to r, ans is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If k is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If k is greater than 0, then if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decremented by the original mi, and if a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variables T, n, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable k is either 0 or greater than 0, depending on the number of iterations. The variable a is a list of n integers, where some elements may have been decremented by the minimum of a[l] and a[r] if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k. The variable l is less than or equal to r, and the variable ans is an integer greater than or equal to 0, depending on the number of times a[r] is 0. If k is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If k is greater than 0, the loop continues to execute until k is 0 or mi * 2 is greater than k.
