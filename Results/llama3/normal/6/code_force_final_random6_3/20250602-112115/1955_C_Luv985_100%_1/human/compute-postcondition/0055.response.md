Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, a is a list of n integers with the first and last elements decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, and the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k, stdin contains T - 2 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of T, n, l, r, ans, and the number of test cases in stdin remain unchanged. The value of k is decreased by twice the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. The first and last elements of list a are decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. The value of mi remains the same, but the condition that the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k is still satisfied because k has been decreased by twice the value of mi.
