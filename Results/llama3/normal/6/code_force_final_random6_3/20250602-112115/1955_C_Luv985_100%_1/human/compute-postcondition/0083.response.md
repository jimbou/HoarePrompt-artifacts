Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and less than its original value, a is a list of n integers with the lth and rth elements decreased by mi, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r must be at least n - 1, ans is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of the lth and rth elements of list a, stdin contains T - 2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of n also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of k is decreased by mi * 2, but it is still greater than 0. The list a is modified as the lth and rth elements are decreased by mi. The value of l and r remains the same as they are not affected by the code. The value of ans is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, depending on the previous value of ans and the condition mi * 2 > k. The value of mi remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The stdin contains T - 2 test cases as the code does not affect the number of test cases.
