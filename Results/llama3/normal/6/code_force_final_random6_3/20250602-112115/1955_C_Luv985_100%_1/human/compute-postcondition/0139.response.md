Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is an integer, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are integers, `k` is greater than 0. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
