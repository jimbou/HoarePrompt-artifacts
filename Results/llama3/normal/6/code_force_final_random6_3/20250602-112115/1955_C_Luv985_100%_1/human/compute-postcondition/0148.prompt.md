Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to the first input, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than or equal to r, ans is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If k is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If k is greater than 0, then if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decremented by the original mi, and if a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l is equal to r, ans is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l]., and the value of ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n - 1, r is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n - 1, ans is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n. If l is equal to r, then ans is equal to the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus the previous value of ans, and the value of ans is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, the current value of l is equal to the current value of r, ans is an integer and is equal to the previous value of ans plus 1 if k is greater than or equal to the integer at index l in list a, otherwise ans is equal to the previous value of ans plus 0, and the value of ans is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
