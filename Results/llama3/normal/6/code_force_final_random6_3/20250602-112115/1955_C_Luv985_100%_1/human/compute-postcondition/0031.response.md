Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then after the subtraction of mi from a[l] and a[r], a[l] is less than or equal to a[r]. If a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
