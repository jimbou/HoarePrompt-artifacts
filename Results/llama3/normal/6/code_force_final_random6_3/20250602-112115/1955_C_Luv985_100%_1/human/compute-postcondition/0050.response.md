According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, T must be greater than 0. So T must be greater than 1.
State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1 and T is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than or equal to r, ans is an integer greater than or equal to 0**
