Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains `T - 2` test cases, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of the first and last elements of list `a`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is either 0 or 1, and the current value of `a[l]` is equal to `t + k // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `T` is still a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and greater than 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `mi`, and `t` are also unchanged. The stdin still contains `T - 2` test cases.
