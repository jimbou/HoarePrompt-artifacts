Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin contains t - 1 test cases, a[0] is reduced by mi, a[n-1] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by twice the value of mi, the current value of a[l] is a[1].**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and `l` has been incremented by 1. The value of `a[l]` is now `a[1]`, which is the second element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
