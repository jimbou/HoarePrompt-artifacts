Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers. If the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[0] is decreased by the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[r] is decreased by the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is updated. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is updated. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is updated. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] remain unchanged. If the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] multiplied by 2 is larger than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a is updated such that a[l] and a[r] are decreased by the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, and mi is updated to be the minimum of the updated a[l] and a[r]. If a[r] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and r is decreased by 1. If a[l] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. Otherwise, if mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1, and if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `ans` is an integer, `t` is either 0 or 1, `r` is an integer, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are integers. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is reduced by twice the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a` is updated by reducing `a[l]` and `a[r]` by the minimum of their original values, and `mi` is updated to the new minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 2 and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
