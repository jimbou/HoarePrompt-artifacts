Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where a[0] is decreased by mi and a[n-1] is decreased by mi, if a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of (a[0] - mi) and (a[n-1] - mi), and the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, mi remain unchanged.***
