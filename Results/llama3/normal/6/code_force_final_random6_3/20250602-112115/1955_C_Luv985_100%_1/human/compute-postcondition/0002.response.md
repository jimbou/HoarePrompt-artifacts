Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code starts by decrementing the value of T by 1. Then, it reads two integers n and k from the input and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. The next line reads n integers from the input and stores them in the list a. The variables l, r, and ans are initialized to 0, n - 1, and 0, respectively. The state of stdin is updated to contain t - 1 test cases.
