This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers from both ends, subtracting the minimum of the two current integers from k and removing the integer if it becomes zero. If k becomes zero or the list is fully processed, the function counts the number of remaining integers that are less than or equal to k and prints the total count of removed and counted integers. The function repeats this process for all test cases and finally prints the results.
