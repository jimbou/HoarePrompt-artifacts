Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. If `k` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `k` is greater than 0, then if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decremented by the original `mi`, and if `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[l]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `mi`, `k`, and `t` still apply.
