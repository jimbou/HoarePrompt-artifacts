According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0. T being greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n - 1, r is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n - 1, ans is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n. If l is equal to r, then ans is equal to the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus the previous value of ans, and the value of ans is printed**
