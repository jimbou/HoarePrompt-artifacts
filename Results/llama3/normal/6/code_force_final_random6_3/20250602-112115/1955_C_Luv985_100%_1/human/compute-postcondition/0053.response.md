Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is the minimum of the first and last elements of list `a`, which is calculated using the `min` function. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t - 2 test cases.
