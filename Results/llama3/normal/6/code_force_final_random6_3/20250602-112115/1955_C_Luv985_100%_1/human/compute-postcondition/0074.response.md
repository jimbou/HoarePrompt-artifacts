Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, a is a list of n integers with the lth and rth elements decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of the original list a, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r can be either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of the original list a, stdin contains T - 2 test cases. If a[l] is equal to 0, then l is either 1 or 2 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r can be either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2 or 3.**
