Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than the minimum possible value of `mi`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `l` is less than `r` with `r` being greater than `l` even after any decrements, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is now determined by the parity of `k`, being 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged, with `T` still being a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, `n` greater than 1, `k` greater than the minimum possible value of `mi`, `a` being a list of `n` integers, `stdin` containing `t - 1` test cases, and `l` and `r` maintaining their relationship with `mi` being the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
