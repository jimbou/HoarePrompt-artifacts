Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than the minimum possible value of `mi`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `l` is less than `r` with `r` being greater than `l` even after any decrements, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code only reassigns the value of `mi` to itself, which does not change the value of `mi`. The other variables remain unchanged.
