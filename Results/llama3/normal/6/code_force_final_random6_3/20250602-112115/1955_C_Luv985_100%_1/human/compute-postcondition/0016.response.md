Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is either 0 or 1, and the current value of `a[l]` minus `t` minus `k` divided by 2 equals 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `mi`, `stdin`, and `t` are still valid.
