Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is an integer, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are integers, `k` is greater than 0. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their original values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The condition `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0 still holds, and if true, `ans` is increased by 1.
