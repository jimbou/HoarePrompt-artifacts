Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `ans` is an integer, `t` is either 0 or 1, `r` is an integer, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are integers. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is reduced by twice the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a` is updated by reducing `a[l]` and `a[r]` by the minimum of their original values, and `mi` is updated to the new minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 2 and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
