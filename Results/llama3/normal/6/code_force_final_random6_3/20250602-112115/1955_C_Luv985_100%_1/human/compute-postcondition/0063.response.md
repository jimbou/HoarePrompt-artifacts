Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, mi * 2 is greater than k, t is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of t is either 0 or 1, depending on whether k is even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged, as the code only assigns a new value to t. The precondition that T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, and mi * 2 is greater than k is still valid after the code has been executed.
