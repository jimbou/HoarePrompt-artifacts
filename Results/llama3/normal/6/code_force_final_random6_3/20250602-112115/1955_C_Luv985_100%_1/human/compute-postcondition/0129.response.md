Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a is updated such that a[l] and a[r] are decreased by the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, and mi is updated to be the minimum of the updated a[l] and a[r]. If a[r] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and r is decreased by 1. If a[l] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. Otherwise, if mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1, and if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
