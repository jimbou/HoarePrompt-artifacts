Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer greater than or equal to -2*mi, a is a list of n integers where a[l] is a[l] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[r] is a[r] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, mi is the minimum of a[l] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r] and a[r] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If a[r] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and r is decreased by 1. If a[l] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1.***
