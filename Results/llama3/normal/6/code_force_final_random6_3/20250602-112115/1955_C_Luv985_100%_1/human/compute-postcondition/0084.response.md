Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and less than its original value, a is a list of n integers with the lth and rth elements decreased by mi, l is either 1 or 2 and if l is 2, then r must be greater than 2, otherwise r must be at least n - 1, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, mi is the minimum of the lth and rth elements of list a, stdin contains T - 3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `l` is now either 1 or 2, and the constraints on `r` have been updated accordingly. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
