Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer greater than or equal to -2*mi, a is a list of n integers where a[l] is a[l] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[r] is a[r] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, mi is the minimum of a[l] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r] and a[r] minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is increased by 1, and l is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, with `a[l]` and `a[r]` modified as described in the initial state, and the rest of the elements remaining unchanged. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, and `mi` are also unchanged.
