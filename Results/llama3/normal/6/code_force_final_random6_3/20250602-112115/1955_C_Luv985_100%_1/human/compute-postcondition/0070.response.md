Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r can be either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that mi is now assigned the value of the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
