Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where a[0] is decreased by mi and a[n-1] is decreased by mi, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of (a[0] - mi) and (a[n-1] - mi), and the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
