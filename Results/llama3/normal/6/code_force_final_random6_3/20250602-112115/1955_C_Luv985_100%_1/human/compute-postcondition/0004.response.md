Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is the minimum of the first and last elements of the list `a`, which are `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
