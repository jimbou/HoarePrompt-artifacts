Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers. If the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[0] is decreased by the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[r] is decreased by the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is updated. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is updated. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is updated. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] remain unchanged. If the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] multiplied by 2 is larger than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
