Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, mi * 2 is greater than k, t is either 0 or 1. The current value of a[l] is equal to t + k // 2.**
