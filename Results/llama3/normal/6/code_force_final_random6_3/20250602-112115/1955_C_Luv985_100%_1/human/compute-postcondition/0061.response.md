Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, a is a list of n integers with the first and last elements decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of list a. If the first element of list a is 0, then l is 1, and ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1. Otherwise, l is 0, and ans is 1 if a[r] is not 0, otherwise ans is 2. mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, and the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k, stdin contains T - 2 test cases. If a[r] is 0, then r is n - 2. Otherwise, r is n - 1.***
