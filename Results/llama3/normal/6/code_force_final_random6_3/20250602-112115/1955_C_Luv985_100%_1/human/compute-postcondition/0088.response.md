Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r must be at least n - 1, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the lth and rth elements of list a. If a[l] is equal to 0, then l is either 1 or 2 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r must be at least n - 1, ans is either 1, 2 or 3. If a[r] is equal to 0, then the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. t is the remainder of k divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that t is now assigned the value of the remainder of k divided by 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
