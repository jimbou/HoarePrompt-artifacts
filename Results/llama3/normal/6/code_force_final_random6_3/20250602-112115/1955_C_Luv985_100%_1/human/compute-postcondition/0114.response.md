Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` multiplied by 2 is larger than `k`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The current value of `a[l]` minus `t` minus `k` divided by 2 equals 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `T` is still a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3, `n` is still greater than 1, `k` is still greater than 0, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, and the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` multiplied by 2 is still larger than `k`. The value of `l` is still 0, `r` is still `n - 1`, and `t` is still either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The current value of `a[l]` minus `t` minus `k` divided by 2 still equals 0.
