The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, T is a positive integer equal to the first input. Since T is already a positive integer, it is already greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
