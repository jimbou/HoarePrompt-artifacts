Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0. In both cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, mi * 2 is greater than k, and t is either 0 or 1.***
