Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than the minimum possible value of mi, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than r with r being greater than l even after any decrements, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decremented by the original mi, and if a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
