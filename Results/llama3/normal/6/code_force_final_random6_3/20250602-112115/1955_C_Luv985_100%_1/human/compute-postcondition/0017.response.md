Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin contains t - 1 test cases, mi * 2 is greater than k, t is either 0 or 1. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.***
