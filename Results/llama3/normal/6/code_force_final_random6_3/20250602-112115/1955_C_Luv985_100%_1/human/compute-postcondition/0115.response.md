Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] multiplied by 2 is larger than k, t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
