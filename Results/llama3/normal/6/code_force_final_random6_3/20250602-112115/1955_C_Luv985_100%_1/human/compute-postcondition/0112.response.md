Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] multiplied by 2 is larger than k, t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable t, which is assigned the value of k modulo 2. This means that t will be 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
