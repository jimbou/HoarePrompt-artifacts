Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
