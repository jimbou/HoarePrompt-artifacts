Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer greater than 0 and k is reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers where a[l] and a[r] are reduced by the minimum of a[l] and a[r], mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] after reduction, l is less than r - 1, ans is an integer, t is either 0 or 1, r is an integer, a[l] and a[r] are integers reduced by the minimum of their original values. If a[l] is 0, then l is incremented by 1 and ans is incremented by 1.***
