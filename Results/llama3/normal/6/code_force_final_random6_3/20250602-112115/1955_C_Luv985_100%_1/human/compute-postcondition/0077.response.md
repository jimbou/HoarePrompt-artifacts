Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, l is either 0 or 1 and if l is 1, then r must be greater than 1, otherwise r can be either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, t is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T remains a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and greater than 0. The values of n, k, a, stdin, l, r, mi, and t remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of ans has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3.
