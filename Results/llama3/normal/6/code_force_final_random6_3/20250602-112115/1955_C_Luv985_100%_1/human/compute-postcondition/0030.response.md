Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1, and if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables T, n, k, a, stdin, l, r, mi, t, and ans remain the same as in the initial state.
