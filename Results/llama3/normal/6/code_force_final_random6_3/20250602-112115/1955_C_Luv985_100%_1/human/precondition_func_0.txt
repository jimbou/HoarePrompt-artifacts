stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^15, and a_i is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9 for all i.
