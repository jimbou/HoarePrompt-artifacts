Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, if a[0] - t - k // 2 == 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0. In both cases, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, mi * 2 is greater than k, and t is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables T, n, k, a, stdin, ans, l, r, mi, and t remain the same as in the initial state.
