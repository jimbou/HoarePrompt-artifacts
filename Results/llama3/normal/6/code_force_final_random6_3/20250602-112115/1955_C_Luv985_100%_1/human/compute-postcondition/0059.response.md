Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, a is a list of n integers with the first and last elements decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, if the first element of list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, and the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k, stdin contains T - 2 test cases. Otherwise, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of list a, and the current value of mi multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to k, stdin contains T - 2 test cases. The current value of a[r] is 0.**
