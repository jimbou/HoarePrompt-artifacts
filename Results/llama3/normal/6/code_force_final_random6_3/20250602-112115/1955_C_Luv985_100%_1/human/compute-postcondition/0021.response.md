Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]**.

In natural language, the output state is: T remains a positive integer equal to the first input minus 1, n remains an integer greater than 1, k remains an integer greater than 0, a remains a list of n integers, stdin still contains t - 1 test cases, l is still less than r, and mi is assigned the minimum value between the integers at index l and r in list a.
