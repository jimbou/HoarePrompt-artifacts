Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of characters from the second input, b is a list of characters from the third input, _ is equal to the first input, stdin is empty. If the character at index n-2 in list b is '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases provided in the input. The loop has iterated over each test case, checked the second last character of the second string, and printed 'No' if it's '<' and 'Yes' otherwise. The loop counter `_` has reached the value equal to the first input `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The input stream `stdin` is empty, as all the input has been consumed by the loop.
