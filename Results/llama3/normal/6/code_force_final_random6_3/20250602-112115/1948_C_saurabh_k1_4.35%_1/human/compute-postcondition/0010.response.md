Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 1, stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, overwriting its previous value. The second line assigns a list of strings, obtained by mapping the input to strings, to `a`, replacing its previous value. The third line does the same for `b`, assigning a new list of strings obtained from the input. The variable `_` remains unchanged, and `stdin` becomes empty after the inputs are read.
