Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The program checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by examining the character at the second-to-last position in the second string of each test case. If the character is '<', it means the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because the arrow at the second-to-last position points to the left, and the robot cannot move outside the grid. If the character is '>', it means the robot can reach the cell (2, n) because the arrow at the second-to-last position points to the right, and the robot can move to the right.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
