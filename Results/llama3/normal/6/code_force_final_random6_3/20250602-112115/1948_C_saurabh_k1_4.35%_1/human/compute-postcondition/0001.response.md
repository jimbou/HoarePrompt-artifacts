The code snippet reads an integer `t` from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads two lines of input from stdin, converts each line into a list of strings using the `map` function, and assigns these lists to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
