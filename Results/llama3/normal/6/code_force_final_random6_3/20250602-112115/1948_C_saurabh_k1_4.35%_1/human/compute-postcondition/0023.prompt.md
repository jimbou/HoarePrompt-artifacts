Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 0, stdin is empty. If the element at index n-2 in list b is '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If the second last element of list b is '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of characters from the second input, b is a list of characters from the third input, _ is 2, stdin is empty. If the character at index n-2 in list b is '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
