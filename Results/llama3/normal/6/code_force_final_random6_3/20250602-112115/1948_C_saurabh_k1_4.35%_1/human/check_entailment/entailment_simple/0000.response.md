Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks the direction of the arrow at index n-2 in the second row. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The robot's movement is determined by its current position and the direction of the arrow at that position. The program does not take into account the robot's movement in the first row or the directions of the arrows in the first row.

For example, consider the case where n = 4, the first row is "><", and the second row is "><>". The program would print "Yes" because the arrow at index n-2 in the second row is ">", but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it would move left from the cell (1, 2) and then move right from the cell (1, 1), resulting in an infinite loop.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
