Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description.

The key insight is that the robot can only move right or down, and it must follow the arrow in the current cell after its move. Since the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n), it must move right at least n-1 times.

The program checks the character at the second-to-last position in the second string (b[n-2]). If it's '<', it means the robot cannot move right from that position, and therefore cannot reach (2, n). If it's '>', the robot can move right and potentially reach (2, n).

The program's logic is correct because it only checks the necessary condition for the robot to reach (2, n), which is that the second-to-last character in the second string must be '>'. If this condition is met, the robot can potentially reach (2, n) by moving right and following the arrows.

Correctness: **True**
