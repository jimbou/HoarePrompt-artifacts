To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `stdin` needs to have another input.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `_` is 2, `stdin` is not empty**
