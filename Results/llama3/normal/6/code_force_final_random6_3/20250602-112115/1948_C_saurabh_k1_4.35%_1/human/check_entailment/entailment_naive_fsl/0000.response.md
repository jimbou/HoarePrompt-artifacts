Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It only checks the direction of the arrow in the second row at index n-2, which is not sufficient to determine the reachability of the cell (2, n).

A counterexample is when n = 4, the first row is "><<", and the second row is "><>". In this case, the program will print "Yes" because the arrow at index n-2 in the second row is ">", but the robot cannot actually reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by considering all possible moves and the directions of the arrows in the grid.
