This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks the character at the second-to-last position in the second string of each test case. If the character is '<', it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function processes all test cases and prints a corresponding 'No' or 'Yes' for each one.
