Output: **`t` is an integer greater than the length of `l` plus 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers `f` and `k`, and one line containing `t` integers `a_i`, `a` is a string containing two integers `f` and `k`, `b` is a list containing three integers `f`, `k`, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer `f`, `f` is an integer `k`, `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from `o` and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of `t` integers `a_i` in descending order, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from `o` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer that is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0, `k` is now decreased by the count of the first element of the list `l` in the dictionary `dic`. The favourite number `fav` is equal to the first element of the list `l`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and 'YES' is printed**
