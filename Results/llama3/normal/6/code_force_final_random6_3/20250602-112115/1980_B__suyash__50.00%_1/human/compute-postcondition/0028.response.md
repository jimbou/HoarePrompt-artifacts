Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers f and k, and one line containing t integers a_i, `a` is a string containing two integers f and k, `b` is a list containing three integers f, k, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer f, `f` is an integer k, `fav` is an integer o[f - 1], `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from o and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of t integers a_i in descending order, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from o in descending order that must have at least 1 element, and fav is equal to l[i], the current value of `k` is an integer k minus the count of fav in dic, and 'MAYBE' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their previous values, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, and the other variables retain their values as specified in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement due to the break statement.
