Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from `o` in descending order with at least 1 element, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers `f` and `k`, and one line containing `t` integers `a_i`, `a` is a string containing two integers `f` and `k`, `b` is a list containing three integers `f`, `k`, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer `f`, `f` is an integer `k`, `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from `o` and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of `t` integers `a_i` in descending order, `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, and `k` is decreased by the count of `l[i]` in `o`, and 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their previous values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
