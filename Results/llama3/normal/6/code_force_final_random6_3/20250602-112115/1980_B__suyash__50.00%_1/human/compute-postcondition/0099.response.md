Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is at least 2, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from `o` in descending order with at least 2 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers `f` and `k`, and one line containing `t` integers `a_i`, `a` is a string containing two integers `f` and `k`, `b` is a list containing three integers `f`, `k`, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer `f`, `f` is an integer `k`, `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from `o` and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of `t` integers `a_i` in descending order, `k` is decreased by the count of `l[i]` in `o`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `k` has been decreased by the count of `l[i]` in `o`. The count of `l[i]` in `o` is obtained from the dictionary `dic`, which stores the counts of each integer in `o`. The value of `k` is now `k - dic[l[i]]`, where `dic[l[i]]` is the count of `l[i]` in `o`.
