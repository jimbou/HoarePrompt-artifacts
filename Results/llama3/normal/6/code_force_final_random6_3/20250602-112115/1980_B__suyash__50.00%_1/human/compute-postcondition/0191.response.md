Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `l`, `k` is an integer that is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0, and `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`. If `fav` is not equal to any element of `l`, 'NO' is printed. If `fav` is equal to any element of `l`, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`. The value of `k` will be either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0, depending on the previous iterations. The value of `fav` will remain the same as the initial value `o[f - 1]`. If `fav` is not equal to any element of `l`, the program will print 'NO'. If `fav` is equal to any element of `l`, the program will print 'YES'.
