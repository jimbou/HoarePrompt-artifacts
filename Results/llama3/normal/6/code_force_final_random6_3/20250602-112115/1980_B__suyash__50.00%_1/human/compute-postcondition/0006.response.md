The code snippet `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers f and k, and one line containing t integers a_i, `a` is a string containing two integers f and k, `b` is a list containing three integers f, k, and an extra integer, `o` is a list containing t integers a_i, `n` is an integer f, `f` is an integer k, and the current value of k is equal to the current value of n, and 'YES' is being printed**
