Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers f and k, and one line containing t integers a_i, `a` is a string containing two integers f and k, `b` is a list containing three integers f, k, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer f, `f` is an integer k, `fav` is an integer o[f - 1], `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from o and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of t integers a_i in descending order, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from o in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer k minus the count of l[i] in dic. If k is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
