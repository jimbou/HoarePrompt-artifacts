The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input contains multiple test cases, each with two lines, the first line contains three integers `t`, `f`, and `k`, and the second line contains `t` integers `a_i`. The value of `t` is one of the three integers in the first line of the test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one line containing two integers `f` and `k`, and one line containing `t` integers `a_i`.**
