Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than the length of `l` plus 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers `f` and `k`, and one line containing `t` integers `a_i`, `a` is a string containing two integers `f` and `k`, `b` is a list containing three integers `f`, `k`, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer `f`, `f` is an integer `k`, `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from `o` and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of `t` integers `a_i` in descending order, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from `o` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, and `k` is an integer that is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0 and is decreased by the count of the second element of the list `l` in the dictionary `dic`. If `fav` is not equal to the first element of `l`, then if `k` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement. If `fav` is equal to the first element of `l`, then `k` is decreased by the count of the first element of the list `l` in the dictionary `dic`. If `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The output state is the same as the initial state because the break statement only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables.
