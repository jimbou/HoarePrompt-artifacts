Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than the length of `l` plus 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers `f` and `k`, and one line containing `t` integers `a_i`, `a` is a string containing two integers `f` and `k`, `b` is a list containing three integers `f`, `k`, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer `f`, `f` is an integer `k`, `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from `o` and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of `t` integers `a_i` in descending order, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from `o` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer that is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement. The current value of `fav` is not equal to the current value of `l[i]`.***
