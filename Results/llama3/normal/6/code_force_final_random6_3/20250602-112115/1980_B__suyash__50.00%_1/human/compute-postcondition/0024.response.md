Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line containing two integers f and k, and one line containing t integers a_i, `a` is a string containing two integers f and k, `b` is a list containing three integers f, k, and an extra integer, `n` is an integer f, `f` is an integer k, `fav` is an integer o[f - 1], `dic` is a dictionary with keys as integers from o and values as their respective counts, `o` is a sorted list of t integers a_i in descending order, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from o in descending order that must have at least 1 element, and fav is equal to l[i], `k` is an integer k minus the count of fav in dic.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the original value of `k` minus the count of `fav` in the dictionary `dic`. The count of `fav` in `dic` is the number of times `fav` appears in the list `o`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
