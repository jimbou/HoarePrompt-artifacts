Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case when the favorite cube has the same value as some of the cubes that are removed. In this case, the program will print "MAYBE" even if the favorite cube is not removed. 

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will print "MAYBE", but the correct answer is "NO" because the favorite cube (3) is not removed in any case.

The issue is in the line `if o.index(fav) > k - 1:`, which checks if the favorite cube is removed based on its index in the sorted list. However, this does not take into account the fact that there may be other cubes with the same value that are removed before the favorite cube. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to keep track of the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are removed, and adjust the index accordingly.
