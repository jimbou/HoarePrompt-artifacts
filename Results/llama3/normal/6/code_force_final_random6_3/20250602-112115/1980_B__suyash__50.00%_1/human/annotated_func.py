#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers t, f, and k (1 <= t, f, k <= 100). The second line contains t integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:

    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is determined by the final values of the variables in the loop head and body. The variable `i` is equal to the length of `l`, `k` is an integer that is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0, and `fav` is an integer `o[f - 1]`. If `fav` is not equal to any element of `l`, 'NO' is printed. If `fav` is equal to any element of `l`, 'YES' is printed. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a favorite number can be found within a certain rank in a list of numbers. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of three integers (total numbers, favorite number position, and rank) and a list of numbers. For each test case, it checks if the favorite number is within the specified rank and prints 'YES' if it is, 'NO' if it's not, or 'MAYBE' if the favorite number is at the boundary of the rank.
