Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `0`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n-1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n-2)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
