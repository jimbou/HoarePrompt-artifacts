Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
