The only variable in the loop head is variable  d and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again `d` is decreased by 1 so `d` is `n - 3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
