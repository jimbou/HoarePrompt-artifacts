According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed  `d` is now `n-1` and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d` is `n-1`**
