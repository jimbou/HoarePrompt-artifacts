To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `d` and the range defined by `n - 1`, `-1`, and the step `-1`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `n - 1` will always be greater than or equal to `-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute.

However, to make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `d` to be within the range defined by `n - 1` and `-1`. Since the loop iterates in reverse order, we can set `d` to be `n - 1` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed**
