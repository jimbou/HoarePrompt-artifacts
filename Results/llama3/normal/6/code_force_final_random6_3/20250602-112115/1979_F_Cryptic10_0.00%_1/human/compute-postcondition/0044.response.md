Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `0`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `d` is now `0`. The function `func_1` has been called with `d` as input, and the returned values `v` and `u` are stored. The list `path` contains the value of `v`. The set `remaining_vertices` has been updated to remove `v` if it was present, and `v` is still present in the set. The other variables `n` and `func_1` remain unchanged.
