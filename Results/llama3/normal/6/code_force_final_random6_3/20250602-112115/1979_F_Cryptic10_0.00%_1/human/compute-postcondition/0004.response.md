Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are returned values from `func_1` with input `d`. The current value of `v` is 0.***
