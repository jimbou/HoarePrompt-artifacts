Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is a list containing the values of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any output that was buffered (i.e., not immediately printed) is now printed to the console. In this case, the output buffer contained the string "!' followed by the elements of the `path` list, separated by spaces". Since the output buffer is now flushed, this string is now printed to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `func_1`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are not affected by this code.
