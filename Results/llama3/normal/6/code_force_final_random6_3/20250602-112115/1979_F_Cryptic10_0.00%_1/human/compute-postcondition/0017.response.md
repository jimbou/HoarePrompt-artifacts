Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are returned by the function `func_1` with input `d`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` twice and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` contains the value of `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with input `d`, and its return values are assigned to `v` and `u`. The value of `v` is used to determine whether it is in the set `remaining_vertices`. If it is, the list `path` is updated to contain the value of `v` twice, and the set `remaining_vertices` is updated to exclude the value of `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the list `path` is updated to contain the value of `v`, and the set `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.
