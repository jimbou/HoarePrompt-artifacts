Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the Hamiltonian path in the graph. The `func_1` function is used to make queries to the graph, and the `func_2` function is used to construct the Hamiltonian path.

The program starts by making a query with the maximum possible degree (`n-1`) and then decreases the degree until it finds a vertex with a degree greater than or equal to the current degree. Once it finds such a vertex, it adds it to the path and removes it from the remaining vertices. This process is repeated until all vertices have been added to the path.

The program handles the case where there are no vertices with a degree greater than or equal to the current degree by continuing to the next degree. It also handles the case where a vertex is not connected to any other vertex by reporting "0 0" and removing the vertex from the remaining vertices.

The program's approach ensures that it will find a Hamiltonian path in the graph, as it is guaranteed to exist based on the problem description. The program's use of binary search reduces the number of queries it needs to make, allowing it to find the Hamiltonian path in at most `n` queries.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
