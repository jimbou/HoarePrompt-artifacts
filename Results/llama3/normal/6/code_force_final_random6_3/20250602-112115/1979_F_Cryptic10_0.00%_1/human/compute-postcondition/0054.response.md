To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `d` is greater than -1. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be decremented by 1, so `d` becomes `n-2`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `func_1`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n-1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`.**
