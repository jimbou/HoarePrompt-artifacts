Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is -1, path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `d` is -1. The value of `v` is the output of the function `func_1` with input `d`, and the value of `u` is also the output of the function `func_1` with input `d`. The list `path` contains the value of `v`, and the set `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed.
