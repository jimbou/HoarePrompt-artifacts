Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(-1)`, `path` is a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all values of `d` from `n-1` to `0`, and for each iteration, if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it has been removed from `remaining_vertices` and added to `path`. The loop has finished executing when `d` is `-1`, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, indicating that all vertices have been visited.
