The only variable in the loop head is variable remaining_vertices, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable remaining_vertices.  If remaining_vertices is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time remaining_vertices must not be empty.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is -1, path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed**
