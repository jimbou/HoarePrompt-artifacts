The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, and `u` is the returned value from `func_1` with input `d`.**
