Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the second integer returned by `func_1(n - 1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `u`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The value of `v` is still 0. The list `path` still contains the value of `v`, which is 0. The set `remaining_vertices` still contains a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
