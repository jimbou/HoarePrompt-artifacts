To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `d` and the range defined by `n-1`, `-1`, and `-1` (the step).

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n-1` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `n-1` will always be greater than or equal to `-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute.

However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `d` to be within the range of the loop. Since the loop starts from `n-1` and ends at `-1` with a step of `-1`, we can set `d` to be `n-1` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration**
