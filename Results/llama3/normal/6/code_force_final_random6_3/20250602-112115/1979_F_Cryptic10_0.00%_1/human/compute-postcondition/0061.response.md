Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, and `d` remain unchanged. The values of `v` and `u` are updated to be the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is updated to be a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is updated to be a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no change occurs to `path` and `remaining_vertices`.
