The only variable in the loop head is variable  d, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is -1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again `d` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
