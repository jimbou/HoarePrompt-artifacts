Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, d is n-1, v is not in the set of remaining_vertices.**

The code snippet appends the value of `v` to the `path` list, removes `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set, and then breaks out of the loop (assuming it's part of a loop). The value of `v` is in the set of `remaining_vertices` initially, and after the code executes, it is removed from the set and added to the `path` list. The other variables, `n`, `func_1`, and `d`, remain unchanged.
