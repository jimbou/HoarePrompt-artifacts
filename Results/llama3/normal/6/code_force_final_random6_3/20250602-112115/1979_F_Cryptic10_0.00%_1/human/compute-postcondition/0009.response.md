Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is n-1. If v is in the set of remaining_vertices, then path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, and v is not in the set of remaining_vertices. Otherwise, no changes are made to path, remaining_vertices, and v.***
