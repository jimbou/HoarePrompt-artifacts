To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while remaining_vertices:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`. For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. Since it is already stated that `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, it is guaranteed that `remaining_vertices` will not be empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `remaining_vertices` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).**
