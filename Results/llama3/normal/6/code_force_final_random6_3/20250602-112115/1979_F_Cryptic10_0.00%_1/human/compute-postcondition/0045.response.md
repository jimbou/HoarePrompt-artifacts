According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. This means that `remaining_vertices` is not empty, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, which means that `v` was not removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration. Therefore, `v` must not be equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `0`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration**
