Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is n-1, v and u are the two integers returned by func_1(n-1), path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The function `func_1` also remains unchanged as it is not modified or called in the code. The value of `d` is still `n-1` as it is not modified by the code. The values of `v` and `u` are still the two integers returned by `func_1(n-1)` as they are not modified by the code.

The list `path` now contains the value of `v` as it was appended to the list in the first line of the code. The set `remaining_vertices` has been modified by removing the value of `v` in the second line of the code. Since `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and was not equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`.
