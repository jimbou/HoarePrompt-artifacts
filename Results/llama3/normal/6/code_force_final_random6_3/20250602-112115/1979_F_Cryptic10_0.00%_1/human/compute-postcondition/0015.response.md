Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are returned by the function `func_1` with input `d`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` twice and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` contains the value of `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.***
