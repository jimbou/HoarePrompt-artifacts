Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, d is -1, v and u are returned by the function func_1 with input d, path is a list containing the value of v twice if v is in remaining_vertices, otherwise it contains the value of v, and remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v is in remaining_vertices, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the `path` and `remaining_vertices` variables based on the value of `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, the code appends `v` to `path` twice and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the code only appends `v` to `path` and leaves `remaining_vertices` unchanged. The value of `v` is determined by the function `func_1` with input `d`, which is -1. The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged.
