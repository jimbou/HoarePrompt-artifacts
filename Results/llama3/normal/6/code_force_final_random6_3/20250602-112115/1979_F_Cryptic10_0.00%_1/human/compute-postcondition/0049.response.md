Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the second integer returned by `func_1(n-1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` which is 0, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain the same, and `v` is still 0.
