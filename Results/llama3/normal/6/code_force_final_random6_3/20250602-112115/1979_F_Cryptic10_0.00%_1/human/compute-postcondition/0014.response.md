Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are returned by the function `func_1` with input `d`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` twice, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends the value of `v` to the `path` list, effectively adding a second occurrence of `v` to the list.
*   The second line removes the value of `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set, ensuring that `v` is no longer present in the set.
*   The third line breaks out of the loop, but since we are only analyzing the effect of the code snippet on the variables, this line does not affect the state of the variables.

The remaining variables, `n` and `d`, are not modified by the code snippet, so their values remain unchanged. The values of `v` and `u` are also not modified, as they are only used as inputs to the function `func_1` and do not change as a result of the code snippet.
