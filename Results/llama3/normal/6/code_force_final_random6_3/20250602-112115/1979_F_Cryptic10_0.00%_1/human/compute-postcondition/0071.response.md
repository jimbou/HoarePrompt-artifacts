Functionality: **The function generates a path by iteratively selecting vertices from a set of remaining vertices, using the provided function func_1 to determine the next vertex to add to the path. The function continues this process until all vertices have been selected, at which point it prints the generated path and flushes the output buffer. The function assumes that func_1 will eventually return a non-zero vertex for each degree d, and that the number of vertices n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.**
