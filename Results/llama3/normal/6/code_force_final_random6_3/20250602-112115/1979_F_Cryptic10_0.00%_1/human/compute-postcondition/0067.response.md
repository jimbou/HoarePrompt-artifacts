Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, path is a list containing the values of v, remaining_vertices is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, the function `func_1` remains unchanged, the list `path` contains the values of `v` that were added in each iteration, and the set `remaining_vertices` is empty, indicating that all vertices have been processed.
