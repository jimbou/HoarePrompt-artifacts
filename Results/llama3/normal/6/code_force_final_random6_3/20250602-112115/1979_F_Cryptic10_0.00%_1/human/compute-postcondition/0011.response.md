Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are returned by the function `func_1` with input `d`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed, and `v` is not in the set of `remaining_vertices`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `d`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain the same as in the initial state. The function `func_1` is called with input `d`, and its output is assigned to `v` and `u`. The value of `v` is added to the list `path`. The set `remaining_vertices` still contains integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), but with `v` removed.
