Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is n - 2, v and u are the two integers returned by func_1(n - 2), path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was in remaining_vertices.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The value of `v` is appended to the `path` list.
*   The value of `v` is removed from the `remaining_vertices` set if it was present.
*   The loop breaks after these operations, so no further iterations are performed.

The values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, and `u` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
