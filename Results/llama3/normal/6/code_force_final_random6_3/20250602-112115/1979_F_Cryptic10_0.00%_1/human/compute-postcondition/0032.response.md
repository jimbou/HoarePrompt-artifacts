To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that `d` will take on the values from `n - 1` down to `0` in decrements of `1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `d` should be decremented by `1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `n - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n`, which remains unchanged.

The state of the other variables (`func_1`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`) does not depend on the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, no change is made.**
