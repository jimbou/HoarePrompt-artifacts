Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is n-2, v and u are the two integers returned by func_1(n-2), path is a list containing the values of v and the original value of v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state by appending the value of `v` to the `path` list, removing `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set, and then breaking out of the loop. The value of `v` is obtained from the function `func_1` when called with the argument `n-2`. The value of `d` is also updated to `n-2`. The values of `n`, `func_1`, and `u` remain unchanged.
