Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are returned values from `func_1` with input `d`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged. The new variables `v` and `u` are assigned the returned values from the function `func_1` with input `d`, which is `n-1`. The specific values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of the function `func_1`.
