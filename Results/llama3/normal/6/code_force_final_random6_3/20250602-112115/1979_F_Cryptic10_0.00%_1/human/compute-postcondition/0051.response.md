Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n-1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to the value that was removed from `remaining_vertices` in the last iteration. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.***
