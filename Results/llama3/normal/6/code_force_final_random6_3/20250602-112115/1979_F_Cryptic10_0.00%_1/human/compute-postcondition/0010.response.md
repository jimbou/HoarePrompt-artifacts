The only variable in the loop head is variable  d, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is -1, so for the loop to execute again `d` must be greater than -1.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is 0, path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, and v is not in the set of remaining_vertices**
