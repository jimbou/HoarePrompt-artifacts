Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is n-1. If v is in the set of remaining_vertices, then path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, and v is not in the set of remaining_vertices. Otherwise, no changes are made to path, remaining_vertices, and v.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are returned by the function `func_1` with input `d`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` twice and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` contains the value of `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, d is -1, v and u are returned by the function func_1 with input d. If v is in remaining_vertices, path is a list containing the value of v twice and remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed. If v is not in remaining_vertices, path contains the value of v and remaining_vertices remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
