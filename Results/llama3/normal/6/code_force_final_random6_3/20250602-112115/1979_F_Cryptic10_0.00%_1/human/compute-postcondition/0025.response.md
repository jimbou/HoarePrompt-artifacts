Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 1)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, and `d` remain the same as in the initial state. The function `func_1` is called with the input `d`, which is equal to `n - 1`, and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`. The values of `v` and `u` are assigned to the variables `v` and `u`, respectively. The list `path` now contains the value of `v`. The set `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing the value of `v`.
