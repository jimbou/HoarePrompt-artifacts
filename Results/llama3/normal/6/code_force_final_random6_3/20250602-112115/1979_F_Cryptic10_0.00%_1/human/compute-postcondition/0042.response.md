Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u) as output, d is n - 3, v and u are the two integers returned by func_1(n - 3), path is a list containing the value of v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was in remaining_vertices and v is in remaining_vertices.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The function `func_1` also remains unchanged as it is not modified or called in the code. The value of `d` is still `n - 3`, which is calculated based on the initial value of `n`. The values of `v` and `u` are still the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 3)`, which are calculated based on the initial value of `n`. The list `path` now contains the value of `v` appended to it. The set `remaining_vertices` has been modified to remove the value of `v` if it was present in the set. The value of `v` is now included in `remaining_vertices` if it was not already present.
