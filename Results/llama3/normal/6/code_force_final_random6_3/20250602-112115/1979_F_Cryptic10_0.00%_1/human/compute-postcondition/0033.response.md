Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, and `d` remain unchanged. However, the values of `v` and `u` are updated to be the output of `func_1(n - 2)`, which is a tuple of two integers. The `path` list now contains the new value of `v`. The `remaining_vertices` set is updated to remove the new value of `v` if it was present in the set.
