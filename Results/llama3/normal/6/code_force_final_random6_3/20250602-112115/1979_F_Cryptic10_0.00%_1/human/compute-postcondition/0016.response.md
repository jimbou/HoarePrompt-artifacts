The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be decreased by 1, so `d` is -1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are returned by the function `func_1` with input `d`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` twice and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` contains the value of `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**
