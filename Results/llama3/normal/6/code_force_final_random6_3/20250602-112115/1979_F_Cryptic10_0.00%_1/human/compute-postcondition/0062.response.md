Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the values of `v` and the original value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no change occurs and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
