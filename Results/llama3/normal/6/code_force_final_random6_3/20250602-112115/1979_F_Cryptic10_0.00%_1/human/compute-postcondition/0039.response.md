Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)` as output, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the two integers returned by `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

The code assigns the output of `func_1(d)` to `v` and `u`. Since `d` is `n - 3`, the output of `func_1(n - 3)` is assigned to `v` and `u`. The values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are not changed by this code. The only change is that `v` and `u` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(n - 3)`.
