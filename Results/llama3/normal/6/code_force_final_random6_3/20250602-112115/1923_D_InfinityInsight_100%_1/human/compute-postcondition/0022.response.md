Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is the last element in the list a.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` remains unchanged, the integer `n` remains unchanged, the list `left` now contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` (starting from 0), the list `last` remains unchanged, the list `ans` remains unchanged with all elements as -1, and the variable `i` now holds the last element in the list `a`.
