To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables in the state, such as `a`, `left`, `last`, and `ans`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 3, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements: -1 and either 1 or -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 2.**
