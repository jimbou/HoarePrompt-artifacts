Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing three elements: 0, `i`, and `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing four elements: 0, `i`, `i` + `i`, and `i` + `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
