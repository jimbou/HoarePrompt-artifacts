The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing three elements: -1, either 1 or -1, and either 2 or either 1 or -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains 2 as its last element. Otherwise, `last` contains either 1 or -1 as its last element.**
