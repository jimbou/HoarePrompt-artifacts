Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list containing the single element -1, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
        last.append(i)
    else:
        last.append(last[-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is a list of non-negative integers, n is at least 2, left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list containing two elements: -1 and either 1 or -1, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is 1. If the current value of a[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i - 1], then the last list contains -1 and 1. Otherwise, the last list contains -1 and -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 3, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing three elements: -1, either 1 or -1, and either 2 or either 1 or -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains 2 as its last element. Otherwise, `last` contains either 1 or -1 as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains 2 as its third element and 3 as its last element. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains either 1 or -1 as its third element and either 2 or either 1 or -1 as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
