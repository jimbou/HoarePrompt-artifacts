Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list containing the single element -1, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1.**

The code initializes three new lists: `left`, `last`, and `ans`. The `left` list contains a single element, 0. The `last` list contains a single element, -1. The `ans` list is initialized with -1 for each of its `n` elements. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.
