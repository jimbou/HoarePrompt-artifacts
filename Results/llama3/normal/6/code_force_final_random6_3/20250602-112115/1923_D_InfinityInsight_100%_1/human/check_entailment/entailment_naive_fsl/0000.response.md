Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a slime can be eaten by another slime from the right side. The current implementation only checks if a slime can be eaten by a larger slime from the left side. 

For example, consider the input [2, 2, 3, 1, 4]. The program will output [2, 1, -1, 1, 2], but the correct output should be [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] because the 3rd slime can be eaten by the 5th slime from the right side.

The program needs to be modified to also check if a slime can be eaten by a larger slime from the right side. This can be done by maintaining another array to store the cumulative sum of the slime sizes from the right side, and then using a similar approach to find the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime from the right side. The minimum of the two values (from the left and right sides) should be taken as the final answer.
