Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing four elements: -1, either 1 or -1, either 2 or either 1 or -1, and 3, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains 2 as its third element. Otherwise, `last` contains either 1 or -1 as its third element.**

In this output state, the value of `last` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the value of `last` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]` still holds, but now it refers to the third element of `last` instead of the last element.
