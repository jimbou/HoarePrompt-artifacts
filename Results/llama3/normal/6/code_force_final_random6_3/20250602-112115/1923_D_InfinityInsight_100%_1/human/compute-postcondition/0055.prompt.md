You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a).
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is n - 1.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is the last element in the list a.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n where each element at index i is either -1, 1, or i + 1 - inx, `i` is n.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' of length 'n' where each element at index 'i' is either -1, 1, or 'i + 1 - inx'. 'n' is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), where 'a' is a list of non-negative integers.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'ans' of length 'n' where each element at index 'i' is either -1, 1, or 'i + 1 - inx'. 'n' is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), where 'a' is a list of non-negative integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
