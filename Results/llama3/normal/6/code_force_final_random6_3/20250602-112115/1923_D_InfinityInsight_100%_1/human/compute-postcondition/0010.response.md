Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 3, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing three elements: -1, either 1 or -1, and either 2 or either 1 or -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains 2 as its last element. Otherwise, `last` contains either 1 or -1 as its last element.***
