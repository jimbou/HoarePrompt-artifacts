The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is n - 1. So for the loop to be executed `a` must have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**
