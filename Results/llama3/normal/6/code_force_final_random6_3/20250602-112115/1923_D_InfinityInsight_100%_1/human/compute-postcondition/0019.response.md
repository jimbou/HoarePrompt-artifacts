Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing three elements: 0, `i`, and `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the list `left` has been updated by appending the sum of its last element (`i`) and `i` itself, resulting in a new third element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial properties and values.
