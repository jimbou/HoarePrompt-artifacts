Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the last element in `left` (which is 0) and the value of `i` (which is the first element in the list `a`). The other variables remain unchanged.
