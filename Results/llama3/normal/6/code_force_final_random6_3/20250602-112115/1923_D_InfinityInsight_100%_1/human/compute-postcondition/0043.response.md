Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), `left` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `i` is 2, `x` is the value of `left[i]` minus `a[i]` minus 1, `inx` is the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in a, `inx2` is the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in a, `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to be `i + 1 - inx`, where `i` is 2 and `inx` is the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
