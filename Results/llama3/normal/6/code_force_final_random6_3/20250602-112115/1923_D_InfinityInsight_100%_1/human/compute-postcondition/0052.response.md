Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), `left` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `i` is 3, `x` is the value of `left[i]` minus `a[i]` minus 1, `inx` is the result of func_1(left, x), `inx2` is the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in a, `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `i + 1 - inx`, where `i` is 3 and `inx` is the result of the function `func_1(left, x)`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that if `inx` is less than 0, the function would have skipped the rest of the current iteration and moved to the next iteration of the loop, but since we are only considering the execution of the given line of code, we do not take this into account.
