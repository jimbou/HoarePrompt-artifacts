Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1 except for the element at index i which is 1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements are -1, i is 1, x is the value of left[i] minus a[i] minus 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a.**

The code executes three lines. The first line calculates the value of `x` by subtracting `a[i]` and 1 from `left[i]`. The second line assigns the result of `func_1(left, x)` to `inx`. The third line assigns the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a` to `inx2`. The values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
