To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the second element in the list `a`**
