Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, i is 2, x is the value of left[i] minus a[i] minus 1, inx is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a, inx2 is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a.**

The code snippet executes three lines, each modifying a different variable. The first line calculates the value of `x` by subtracting `a[i]` and 1 from `left[i]`. The second line assigns the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a` to `inx` using the function `func_1(left, x)`. The third line assigns the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a` to `inx2` directly from the `last` list.

After executing the code, the values of `x`, `inx`, and `inx2` are updated. The value of `x` is now the result of the calculation `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. The value of `inx` is the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a`, as determined by the function `func_1(left, x)`. The value of `inx2` is also the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a`, directly obtained from the `last` list.

The other variables, `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, and `i`, remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
