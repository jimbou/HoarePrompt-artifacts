Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements: -1 and 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the list `last` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `last` now contains two elements: -1 (its initial value) and 1 (the current value of `i`). The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
