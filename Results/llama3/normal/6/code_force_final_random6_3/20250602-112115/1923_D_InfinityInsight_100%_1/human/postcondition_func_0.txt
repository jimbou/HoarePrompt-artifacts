This function determines the position of a given integer `x` in a sorted list `a` or where it should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of `x` in `a` plus 1 if `x` is found, or the index where `x` should be inserted if not found. The function effectively performs a binary search on the sorted list `a` to find the appropriate position for `x`.
