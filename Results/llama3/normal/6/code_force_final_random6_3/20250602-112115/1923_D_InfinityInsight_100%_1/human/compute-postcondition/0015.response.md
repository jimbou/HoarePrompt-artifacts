Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The list `a` remains unchanged, containing non-negative integers.
* The integer `n` remains unchanged, representing the number of iterations the loop should execute.
* The list `left` remains unchanged, containing only the single element 0.
* The list `last` now contains the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a`. If an element is not present in `a`, its index is -1.
* The list `ans` remains unchanged, containing all elements as -1.
* The variable `i` has reached its final value, which is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed all the iterations.

Note that the loop only updates the `last` list and the `i` variable, leaving the other variables unchanged.
