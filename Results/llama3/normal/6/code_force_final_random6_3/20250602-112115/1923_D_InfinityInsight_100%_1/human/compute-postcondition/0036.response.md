Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n where the element at index i is 1, i is 2, x is the value of left[i] minus a[i] minus 1, inx is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a, inx2 is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a.**

The code block consists of two lines: `ans[i] = 1` and `continue`. The first line assigns the value 1 to the element at index `i` in the list `ans`. Since `i` is 2, the element at index 2 in `ans` becomes 1. The second line, `continue`, does not affect any variables and is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop (not shown in the given code snippet). 

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that the element at index `i` (which is 2) in the list `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
