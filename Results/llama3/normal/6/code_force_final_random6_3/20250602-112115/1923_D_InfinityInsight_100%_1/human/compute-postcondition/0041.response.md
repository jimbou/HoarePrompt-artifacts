Output State: **The program state remains unchanged because the continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `a` still contains non-negative integers, `n` is still a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), `left` is still a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in `a`, `last` is still a list of length `n` containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a`, `i` is still 2, `x` is still the value of `left[i]` minus `a[i]` minus 1, `inx` is still the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a`, and `inx2` is still the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a`.
