According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. The variable `i` is also in the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1.

State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is at least 2, left is a list containing the single element 0, last is a list containing the single element -1, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, i is 1**
