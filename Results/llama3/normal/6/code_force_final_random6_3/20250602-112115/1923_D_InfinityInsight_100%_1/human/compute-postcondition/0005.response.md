Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements: -1 and -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to the element at index `i-1` in list `a`**

In this output state, the only change is that the `last` list now contains two elements: -1 and -1, as the code appends the last element of `last` (which is -1) to itself. All other variables remain unchanged.
