Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, where `n` is less than the length of `a`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element at index `i` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i` in the list `a`. If no such subsequence exists, the element at index `i` is -1. If the element at index `i` is less than the element at index `i-1`, the element at index `i` is 1. Otherwise, the element at index `i` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`, which is calculated based on the cumulative sum of elements in `a` and the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a`.**
