Postcondition: ***a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, i is 3, x is the value of left[i] minus a[i] minus 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a. If inx is less than 0, then the function skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
