Postcondition: ***a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1 except for the element at index i which is 1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements are -1, i is 1.***
