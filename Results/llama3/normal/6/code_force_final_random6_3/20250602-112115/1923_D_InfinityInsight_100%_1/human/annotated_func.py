#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a sorted list of integers and x is an integer such that x is in a or x is less than the smallest element in a or x is greater than the largest element in a.

The returned value is the position of `x` in the sorted list `a` if `x` is in `a`, or the position where `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a` if `x` is not in `a`.
    #State: *`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an integer such that `x` is in `a` or `x` is less than the smallest element in `a` or `x` is greater than the largest element in `a`, and `x` is not less than 0, `inx` is the index of `x` in `a` if `x` is in `a`, otherwise `inx` is the index where `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. Additionally, the element at index `inx` in `a` is not equal to `x`.

    #The program returns the index where `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`, which is either the index of `x` in `a` if `x` is in `a`, or the index where `x` should be inserted if `x` is not in `a`. This index is guaranteed to be the position where `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`, given that `x` is not less than 0 and the element at this index in `a` is not equal to `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the position of a given integer `x` in a sorted list `a` or where it should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of `x` in `a` plus 1 if `x` is found, or the index where `x` should be inserted if not found. The function effectively performs a binary search on the sorted list `a` to find the appropriate position for `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, where `n` is less than the length of `a`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element at index `i` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i` in the list `a`. If no such subsequence exists, the element at index `i` is -1. If the element at index `i` is less than the element at index `i-1`, the element at index `i` is 1. Otherwise, the element at index `i` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`, which is calculated based on the cumulative sum of elements in `a` and the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a`.
