Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing four elements: 0, `i`, `i` + `i`, and `i` + `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the list `left` has been updated by appending the sum of its last element and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `left` now contains four elements: the initial three elements (0, `i`, and `i` + `i`) and the newly appended element (`i` + `i` + `i`).
