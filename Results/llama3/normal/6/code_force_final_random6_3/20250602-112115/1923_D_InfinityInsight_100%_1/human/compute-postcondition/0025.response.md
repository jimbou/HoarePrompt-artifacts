Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1 except for the element at index i which is 1, i is 1. The current value of a[i] is less than the current value of a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to 1, while all other elements in `ans` remain -1. The rest of the variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, and `i`) retain their initial values and properties.
