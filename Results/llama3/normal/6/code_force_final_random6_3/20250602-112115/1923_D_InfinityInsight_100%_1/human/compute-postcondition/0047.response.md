Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), left is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, last is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, i is 3, x is the value of left[i] minus a[i] minus 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is the index of the last occurrence of a[i - 1] in a.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to be the result of `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. The value of `inx` is updated to be the result of `func_1(left, x)`, which is a function that takes `left` and `x` as inputs and returns a value. The value of `inx2` is updated to be the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in `a`.
