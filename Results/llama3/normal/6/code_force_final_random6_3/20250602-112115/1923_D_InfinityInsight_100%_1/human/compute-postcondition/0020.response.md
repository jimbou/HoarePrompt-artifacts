The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time `a` must have at least 3 elements and `i` is the third element in the list `a`.
State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(a), `left` is a list containing three elements: 0, `i`, and `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `ans` is a list of length n containing all elements as -1, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**
