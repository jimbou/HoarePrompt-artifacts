Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n < len(a), `left` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the cumulative sum of all elements in a, `last` is a list of length n containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in a, `i` is 3, `x` is the value of `left[i]` minus `a[i]` minus 1, `inx` is the result of func_1(left, x), `inx2` is the index of the last occurrence of `a[i - 1]` in a, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain the same, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
