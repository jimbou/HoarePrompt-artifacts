Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list containing the single element 0, `last` is a list containing four elements: -1, either 1 or -1, either 2 or either 1 or -1, and either 2 or either 1 or -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as -1, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains 2 as its last two elements. Otherwise, `last` contains either 1 or -1 as its last two elements.**

In this output state, the list `last` has been updated by appending its last element to itself. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `last` now depends on whether `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`. If they are not equal, `last` contains 2 as its last two elements; otherwise, it contains either 1 or -1 as its last two elements.
