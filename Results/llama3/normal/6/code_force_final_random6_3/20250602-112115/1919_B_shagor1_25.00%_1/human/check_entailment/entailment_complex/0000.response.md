Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

The program reads a test case from standard input, consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing "+" and "-" characters. It then counts the number of "-" characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` are split such that each array has a sum of either 0 or 1. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the sum is 0 or 1.

The program calculates the minimum possible penalty by printing the difference between `n` and twice the number of "-" characters in `s`, unless the number of "-" characters equals `n`, in which case it prints `n`. This is correct because:

* If the number of "-" characters is less than `n`, then the minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the arrays such that each array has a sum of 0 or 1. The number of arrays with a sum of 1 is equal to the number of "+" characters, which is `n - neg`. The number of arrays with a sum of 0 is equal to the number of "-" characters, which is `neg`. Therefore, the minimum possible penalty is `n - 2 * neg`.
* If the number of "-" characters equals `n`, then the minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the arrays such that each array has a sum of -1. In this case, the minimum possible penalty is `n`.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
