Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`.

The function `func_1()` reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It then initializes a variable `neg` to 0, which will be used to count the number of '-' characters in the string.

The function then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '-', it increments the `neg` variable.

After the loop, the function prints the result, which is calculated as `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

The reasoning behind this calculation is as follows:

* If the number of '+' characters is equal to the number of '-' characters, the optimal way to split the array is to put all '+' characters in one subarray and all '-' characters in another subarray. In this case, the penalty is equal to the length of the array, which is `n`.
* If the number of '+' characters is not equal to the number of '-' characters, the optimal way to split the array is to put all '+' characters in one subarray and all '-' characters in another subarray, and then split the subarray with the larger number of characters into two subarrays of equal length. In this case, the penalty is equal to the length of the array minus twice the number of '-' characters, which is `n - 2 * neg`.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
