The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has `n` characters, `i` is the first character of `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least `n-1` characters and the `i` is the second character of `s`. `n` is an integer greater than 0, so `n-1` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, so `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**
