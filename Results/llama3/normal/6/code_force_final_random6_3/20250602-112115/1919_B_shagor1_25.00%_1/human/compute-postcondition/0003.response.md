The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, and since `neg` was 0, it is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `i` is the first character of `s` and equals '-', `neg` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.
