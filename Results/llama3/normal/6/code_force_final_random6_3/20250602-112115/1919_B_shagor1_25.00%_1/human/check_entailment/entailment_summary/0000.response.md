Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of "-" characters in the string and then printing the difference between the length of the string and twice the number of "-" characters, unless the number of "-" characters equals the length of the string, in which case it prints the length of the string.

This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. When the array consists of only "+" characters, the sum is equal to the length of the array, and when the array consists of only "-" characters, the sum is equal to the negative of the length of the array. By counting the number of "-" characters, the program effectively calculates the sum of the array, and then prints the penalty.

The program also handles the edge case where the number of "-" characters equals the length of the string, in which case the penalty is equal to the length of the string.

Correctness: **True**
