Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
*   It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
*   Finally, it prints the minimum possible penalty, which is calculated as `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This is correct because the minimum penalty is achieved when the string is split into subarrays with alternating sums of 1 and -1. The total penalty is then equal to the length of the string minus twice the number of '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
