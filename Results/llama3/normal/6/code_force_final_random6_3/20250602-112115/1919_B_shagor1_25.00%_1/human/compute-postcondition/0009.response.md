Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is 3. Otherwise, `neg` is 2. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is now 3, otherwise, it remains 2. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is also unchanged.
