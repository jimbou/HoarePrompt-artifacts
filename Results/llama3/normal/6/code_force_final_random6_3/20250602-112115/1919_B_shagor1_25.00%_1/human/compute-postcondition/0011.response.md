Output State: **`n` is 0, `s` is an empty string, `i` is the last character of the original string `s`. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s`. Otherwise, `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s` minus 1. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the length of the string `s` will be 0, and the variable `i` will hold the last character of the original string `s`. The value of `neg` will be equal to the total number of '-' characters in the original string `s`. The state of `stdin` will be reduced by the number of test cases equal to the original length of the string `s`.
