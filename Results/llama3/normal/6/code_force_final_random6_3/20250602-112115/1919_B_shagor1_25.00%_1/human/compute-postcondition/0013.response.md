Output: **`n` is 0, `s` is an empty string, `i` is the last character of the original string `s`. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s`. Otherwise, `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s` minus 1. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n`, and this is printed: the difference between `n` and twice the number of '-' characters in the original string `s` if `n` is not equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s`, otherwise `n`**
