To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `s` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next character in `s`.

Since `s` has a length of `n-1`, and `i` is the second character, the next character would be the third character. Therefore, `i` should be the third character of `s`.

The other variables, `n`, `neg`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is 2. Otherwise, `neg` remains 1. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**
