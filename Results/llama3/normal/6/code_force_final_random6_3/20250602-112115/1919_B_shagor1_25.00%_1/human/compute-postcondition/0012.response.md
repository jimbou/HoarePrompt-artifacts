To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `s` is an empty string.
- `i` is the last character of the original string `s`. Since `s` is empty, `i` is not applicable in this context.
- If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s`. Otherwise, `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string `s` minus 1. Given that `s` is empty, it does not contain any '-' characters, so `neg` would be 0 based on the condition that it's the number of '-' characters minus 1 when `i` is not '-'.
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n`. This information is not directly relevant to the calculation but indicates that there's an external input source.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the print statement:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```
Since `n` is 0 and `neg` is 0 (based on the empty string `s` and the conditions provided), we can substitute these values into the expression:
- `n != neg` is `False` because both `n` and `neg` are 0.
- Therefore, the expression `n - 2 * neg` is not evaluated because the condition `n != neg` is `False`.
- The expression falls back to `n`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
