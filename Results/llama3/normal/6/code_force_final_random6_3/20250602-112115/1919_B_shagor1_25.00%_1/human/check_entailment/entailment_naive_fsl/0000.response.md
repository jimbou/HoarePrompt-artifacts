Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of negative signs in the string and then using the formula `n - 2 * neg` to calculate the penalty. This formula works because the penalty is the absolute value of the sum of the array multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is `n - 2 * neg` (where `n` is the length of the array and `neg` is the number of negative signs). The program also handles the case where `n` is equal to `neg` correctly by printing `n`.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over the string to count the number of negative signs, and then uses this count to calculate the penalty. The formula used to calculate the penalty is correct and takes into account the length of the array and the number of negative signs.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
