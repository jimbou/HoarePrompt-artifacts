Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is 2. Otherwise, `neg` remains 1. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1. If `i` equals '-', then `neg` is now 2, otherwise, it remains 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
