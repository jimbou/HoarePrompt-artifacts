Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other. The current value of `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. `k` is less than `a[r]` multiplied by 2. The value of `a[r]` multiplied by 2 minus 1 is not equal to `k`***
