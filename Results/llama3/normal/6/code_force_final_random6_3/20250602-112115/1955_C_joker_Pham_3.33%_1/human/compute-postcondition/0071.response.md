The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust them.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `r`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`**
