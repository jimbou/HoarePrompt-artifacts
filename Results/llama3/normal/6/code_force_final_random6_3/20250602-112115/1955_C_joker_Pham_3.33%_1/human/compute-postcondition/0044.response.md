The variables in the loop head are l and r, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and r. If l is less than or equal to r, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l and r are equal to some value and to each other. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so we need to adjust them to l is less than or equal to r.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
