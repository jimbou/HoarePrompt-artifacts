Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l and r are equal to some value and to each other, the current value of a[r] is less than a[l], the current value of k is greater than or equal to twice the value of a[r], the value of k was reduced by twice the value of a[r], the value of a[l] was reduced by the value of a[r], the current value of a[l] is 0, sunks is 1 greater than its original value, l is 1 greater than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers. The values of `l` and `r` are still equal to each other, but `l` has been incremented by 1. The value of `a[r]` is still less than `a[l]`. The value of `k` is still greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`. The value of `k` was reduced by twice the value of `a[r]`. The value of `a[l]` was reduced by the value of `a[r]`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0. The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1.
