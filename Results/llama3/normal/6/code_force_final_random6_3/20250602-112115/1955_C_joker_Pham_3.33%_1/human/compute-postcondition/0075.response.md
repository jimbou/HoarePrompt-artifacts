Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
