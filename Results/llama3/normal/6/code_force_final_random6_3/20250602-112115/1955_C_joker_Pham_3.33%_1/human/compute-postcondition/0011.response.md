Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other. The current value of `l` and `r` are such that `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurred.**
