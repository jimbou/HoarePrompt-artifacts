Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus 2 times `a[l]`, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, then `a[r-1]` is updated to its original value minus `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `a[r]` is updated to its original value minus `a[l]`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is less than `a[r]`, no change occurs. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is less than `a[r]`, no change occurs. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
