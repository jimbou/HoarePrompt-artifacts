Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then the following conditions apply: if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is 1. If `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`, then `sunks` is 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is equal to its original value plus 1, `r` is equal to its original value minus 1 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains unchanged, and `sunks` is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, no change occurred. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no change occurred. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
