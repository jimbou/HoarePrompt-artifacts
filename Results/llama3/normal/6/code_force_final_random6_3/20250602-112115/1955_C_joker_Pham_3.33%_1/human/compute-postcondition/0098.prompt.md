Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n-1, sunks is 0
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then the following conditions apply: if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is 1. If `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`, then `sunks` is 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is equal to its original value plus 1, `r` is equal to its original value minus 1 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains unchanged, and `sunks` is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, no change occurred. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` multiplied by 2, then `l` is 1 greater than its original value, `r` is 1 less than its original value, and `sunks` is 1 greater than its original value. Otherwise, if `k` is less than `a[r]` multiplied by 2, then `k` is less than `a[r]` multiplied by 2. If `k` is equal to `a[r]` multiplied by 2 minus 1, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, no specific action is taken and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is 0, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `k` is updated to its original value minus 2 times `a[l]`, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, then `a[r-1]` is updated to its original value minus `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `a[r]` is updated to its original value minus `a[l]`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is less than `a[r]`, no change occurs. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is less than `a[r]`, no change occurs. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, no change occurs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
