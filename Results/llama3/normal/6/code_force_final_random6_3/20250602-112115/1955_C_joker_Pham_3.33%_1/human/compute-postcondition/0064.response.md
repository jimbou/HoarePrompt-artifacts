Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer or 0, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than or equal to r, a[l] is less than a[r], k is less than a[l] * 2. If a[l] equals 0, then sunks is incremented by 2 and l is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of sunks and l remain unchanged.***
