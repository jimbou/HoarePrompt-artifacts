Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no specific action is taken. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no specific action is taken. If `k` equals 0 at any point, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
