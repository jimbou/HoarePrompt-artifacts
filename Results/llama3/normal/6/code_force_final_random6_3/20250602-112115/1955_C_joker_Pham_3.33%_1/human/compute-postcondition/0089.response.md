Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer or 0, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than r, k is updated to its original value minus 2 times a[r], a[l] is updated to its original value minus a[r], sunks is incremented by 1 if a[r] is 0, a[r-1] is updated to its original value minus a[l] if a[r] is 0, a[r] is updated to its original value minus a[l] if a[r] is not 0, sunks is incremented by 1 if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r], no change occurs if l is not equal to r or k is less than a[r].**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[r]` from its original value. The value of `a[l]` is updated by subtracting the value of `a[r]` from its original value. If `a[r]` is 0, the value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the value of `a[r-1]` is updated by subtracting the value of `a[l]` from its original value. If `a[r]` is not 0, the value of `a[r]` is updated by subtracting the value of `a[l]` from its original value. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, the value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. No change occurs if `l` is not equal to `r` or `k` is less than `a[r]`.
