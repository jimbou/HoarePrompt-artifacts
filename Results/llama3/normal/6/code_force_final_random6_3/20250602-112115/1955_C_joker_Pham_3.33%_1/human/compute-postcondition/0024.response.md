Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other. The current value of `l` and `r` are such that `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is 1. If `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`, then `sunks` is 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is equal to its original value plus 1, `r` is equal to its original value minus 1 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains unchanged, and `sunks` is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, no change occurred.***
