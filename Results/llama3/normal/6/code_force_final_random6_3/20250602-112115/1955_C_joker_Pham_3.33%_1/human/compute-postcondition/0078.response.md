Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer or 0 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times a[l], a is a list of n positive integers where a[r] is equal to its original value minus a[l], l is less than r. If l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r], then sunks is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l equals r and k is less than a[r], no change occurs. If l is not equal to r, no change occurs.**
