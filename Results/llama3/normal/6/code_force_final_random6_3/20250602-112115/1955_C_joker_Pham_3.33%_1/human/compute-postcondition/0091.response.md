Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer or 0, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than r. If a[l] is 0, k is updated to its original value minus 2 times a[r], a[l] is updated to its original value minus a[r], sunks is incremented by 2 if a[r] is 0, a[r-1] is updated to its original value minus a[l] if a[r] is 0, a[r] is updated to its original value minus a[l] if a[r] is not 0, and l is incremented by 1. If a[l] is not 0, no change occurs if l is not equal to r or k is less than a[r], otherwise, sunks is incremented by 1 if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r], and a[r] is updated to its original value minus a[l] if a[r] is not 0.***
