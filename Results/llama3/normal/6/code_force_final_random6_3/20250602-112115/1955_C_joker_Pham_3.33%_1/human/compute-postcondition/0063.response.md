Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer or 0, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than or equal to r, a[l] is less than a[r], k is less than a[l] * 2, sunks is incremented by 2, l is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `sunks` has been incremented by 2 due to the first line of the code, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1 due to the second line of the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
