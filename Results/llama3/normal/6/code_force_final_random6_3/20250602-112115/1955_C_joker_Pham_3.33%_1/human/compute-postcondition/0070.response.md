Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, no specific action is taken and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
