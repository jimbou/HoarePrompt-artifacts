Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other, `sunks` is 0. If `k` was 0, we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement before entering this if condition, otherwise, no change occurred. The current value of `l` and `r` are equal. Additionally, the value of `k` is greater than or equal to the value of the element at index `r` in the list `a`.**
