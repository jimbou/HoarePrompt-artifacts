Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value and to each other. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` multiplied by 2, then `l` is 1 greater than its original value, `r` is 1 less than its original value, and `sunks` is 1 greater than its original value. Otherwise, if `k` is less than `a[r]` multiplied by 2, then `k` is less than `a[r]` multiplied by 2. If `k` is equal to `a[r]` multiplied by 2 minus 1, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
