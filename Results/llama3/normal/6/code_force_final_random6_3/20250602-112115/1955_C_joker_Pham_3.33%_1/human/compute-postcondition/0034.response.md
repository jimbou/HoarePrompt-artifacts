Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l and r are equal to some value and to each other. The current value of a[r] is less than a[l]. The current value of k is greater than or equal to twice the value of a[r]. The value of k is reduced by twice the value of a[r]. The value of a[l] is reduced by the value of a[r]. If the current value of a[l] is 0, then sunks is 1 greater than its original value, and l is 1 greater than its original value.***
