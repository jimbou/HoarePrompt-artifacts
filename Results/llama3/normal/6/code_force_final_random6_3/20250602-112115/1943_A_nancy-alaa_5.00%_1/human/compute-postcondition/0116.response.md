Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True if any element in `arr` has a count of 1, otherwise False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the dictionary `mpp` remains unchanged. The variable `first` is set to True if any element in the list `arr` has a count of 1 in the dictionary `mpp`, otherwise it remains False. The list `arr` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
