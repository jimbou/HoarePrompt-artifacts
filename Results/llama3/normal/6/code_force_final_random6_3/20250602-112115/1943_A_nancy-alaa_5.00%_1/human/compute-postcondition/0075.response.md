Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed and 1 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `first` has been set to True, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `i`, `mpp`, and `first` are still applicable, and if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then the value of `i` (which is 2) is printed, and 1 is also printed.
