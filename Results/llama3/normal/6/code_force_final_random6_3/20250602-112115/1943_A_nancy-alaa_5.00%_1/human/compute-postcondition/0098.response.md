Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. Additionally, if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
