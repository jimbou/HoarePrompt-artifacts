Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. It uses a `Counter` object from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
3. The program then iterates over the range of non-negative integers up to `n`. For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is not present in the `Counter` object (i.e., `i` is not in the list). If so, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX of the list is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list.
4. If all non-negative integers up to `n` are present in the list, the program checks if any integer appears only once. If it finds such an integer, it prints it and breaks out of the loop. This is because, in this case, the MEX of the list is the smallest integer that appears only once.
5. The program correctly handles the case where all non-negative integers up to `n` are present in the list and each appears at least twice. In this case, the MEX is `n`, but the program doesn't need to explicitly handle this case because the loop will simply terminate without printing anything.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the list, which is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list or appears only once.

Correctness: **True**
