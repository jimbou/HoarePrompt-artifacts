Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed and 1 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
