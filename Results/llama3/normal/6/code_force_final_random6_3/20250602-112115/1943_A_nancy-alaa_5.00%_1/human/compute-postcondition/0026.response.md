Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the value of `i` which is equal to `[i]` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and `first` remains unchanged.***
