Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed and 1 is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` (which is 2) is printed. Additionally, 1 is printed.
