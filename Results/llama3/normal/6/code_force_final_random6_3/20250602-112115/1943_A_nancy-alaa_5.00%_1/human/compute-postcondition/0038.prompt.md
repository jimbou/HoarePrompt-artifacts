Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is False, then `first` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the value of `i` which is equal to `[i]` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and `first` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2 inputs. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration. `n` is always greater than `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
