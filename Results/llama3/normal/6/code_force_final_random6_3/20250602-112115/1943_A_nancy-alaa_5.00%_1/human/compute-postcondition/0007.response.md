Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
