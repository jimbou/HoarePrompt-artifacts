Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made., and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the count of `i` in `mpp` and the value of `first` also remains the same. However, we have now broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` (which is 1) is being printed.
