Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed**
