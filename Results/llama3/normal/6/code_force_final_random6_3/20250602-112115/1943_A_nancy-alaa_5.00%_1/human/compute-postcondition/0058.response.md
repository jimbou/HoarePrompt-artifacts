Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The state of `first` is still dependent on the value of `i` and `mpp[i]`. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` (which is 1) is being printed.
