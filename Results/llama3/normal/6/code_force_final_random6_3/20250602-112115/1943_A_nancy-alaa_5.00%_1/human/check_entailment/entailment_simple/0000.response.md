Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`.

2. It uses a `Counter` object `mpp` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. This is an efficient way to count the occurrences of each integer.

3. The program then iterates over the range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`). For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is not present in `mpp` (i.e., `i` is not present in `arr`). If this is the case, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX of `arr` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `arr`.

4. If `i` is present in `mpp`, the program checks if the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and if `first` is `True`. If both conditions are true, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because if `i` has a count of 1 and `first` is `True`, it means that there is another integer `j` in `arr` that has a count of 1, and `i` is the smaller of the two. In this case, the MEX of `arr` is `i`.

5. If `i` has a count of 1 but `first` is `False`, the program sets `first` to `True`. This is because it has found an integer with a count of 1, and it needs to check if there is another integer with a count of 1.

6. If the loop completes without finding an integer that is not present in `arr` or an integer with a count of 1, it means that all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr`, and the MEX of `arr` is `n`. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly, which is a minor oversight.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
