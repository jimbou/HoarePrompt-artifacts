Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
