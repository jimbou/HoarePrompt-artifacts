Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**

In this output state, `n` is a positive integer because `input()` must be greater than 0. The value of `n` is assigned from the first input in stdin. `arr` is a list of integers because it is assigned from the second input in stdin, which is a space-separated list of integers. `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, because it is created using the `Counter` function from the `arr` list. `first` is `False` because it is explicitly assigned this value. The value of `_` remains 0 because it is not modified by the code. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs because two inputs are consumed by the code.
