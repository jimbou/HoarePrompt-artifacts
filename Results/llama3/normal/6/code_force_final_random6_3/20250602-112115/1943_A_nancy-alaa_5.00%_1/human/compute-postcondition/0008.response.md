Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
