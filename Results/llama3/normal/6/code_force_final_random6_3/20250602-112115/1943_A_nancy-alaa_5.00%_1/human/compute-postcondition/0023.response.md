Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`. The value of `i` which is equal to [i] is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and since `n` is greater than `i`, the condition `n > i` still holds true. Additionally, the value of `i` is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
