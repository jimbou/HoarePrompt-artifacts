Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `first` is False. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
