The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`**
