Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2 inputs. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration. `n` is always greater than `i`, and the value of `i` is being printed**
