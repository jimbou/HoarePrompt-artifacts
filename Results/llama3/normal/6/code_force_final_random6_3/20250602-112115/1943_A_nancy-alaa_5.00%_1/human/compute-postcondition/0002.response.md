To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which means it is already greater than 0, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since the loop will start from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
