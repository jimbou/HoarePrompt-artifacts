Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `first` is True if there is at least one element in `arr` that appears only once, otherwise `first` is False.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, with the exception of the loop counter `i`, which will be equal to `n`, and the flag `first`, which will be set to True if there is at least one element in the array `arr` that appears only once, and False otherwise.
