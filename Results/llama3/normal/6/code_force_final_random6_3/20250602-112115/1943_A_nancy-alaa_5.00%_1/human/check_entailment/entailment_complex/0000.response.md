Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. It uses a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each integer in the list. This is an efficient way to count the occurrences of each integer.
3. The program then iterates over the range of non-negative integers from 0 to `n-1`. For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is not present in the `Counter` object (i.e., `i` is not in the list). If so, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX of the list is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list.
4. If all non-negative integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the list, the program checks if any integer has a count of 1. If so, it prints that integer and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX of the list is the smallest integer that appears only once.
5. The program correctly handles the case where all non-negative integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the list and no integer has a count of 1. In this case, the MEX of the list is `n`, but the program does not need to print anything because the loop will terminate without printing anything.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the list, which is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list or the smallest integer that appears only once.

Correctness: **True**
