Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, then `first` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
