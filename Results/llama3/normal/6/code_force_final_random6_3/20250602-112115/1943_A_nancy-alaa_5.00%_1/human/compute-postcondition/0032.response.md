The code prints the value of `i`, which is an integer that is incremented until it is no longer in the keys of the dictionary `mpp`. Since `n` is always greater than `i`, the loop continues until `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the value of `i` printed is the first value that is not a key in the dictionary `mpp` or the value of `n` if all values up to `n` are keys in the dictionary `mpp`.

Output: **the first value not in mpp.keys() or n if all values up to n are keys in mpp**
