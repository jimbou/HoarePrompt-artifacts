Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. and the value of `i` which is equal to [i] is being printed**
