Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The key insight is that Alice should try to pick the smallest number that appears an odd number of times in the array, because this will ensure that Bob cannot pick a number that would make the MEX of Alice's array smaller.

The program uses a Counter object to count the frequency of each number in the array. It then iterates over the numbers from 0 to n-1, and checks if the current number is not in the Counter object (i.e., it does not appear in the array) or if it appears an odd number of times (i.e., its count is 1). If it finds such a number, it prints it and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles the case where the array contains only numbers that appear an even number of times, in which case the MEX of Alice's array will be n. It also correctly handles the case where the array contains numbers that appear an odd number of times, in which case the MEX of Alice's array will be the smallest such number.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
