Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one input instead of two. The value of `i` is still increased by 1, and it is still less than `n`. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
