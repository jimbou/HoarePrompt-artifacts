Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then finds and prints the smallest missing non-negative integer in the list, or the smallest integer that appears only once if all non-negative integers are present. The function processes all test cases and consumes all input from standard input.**
