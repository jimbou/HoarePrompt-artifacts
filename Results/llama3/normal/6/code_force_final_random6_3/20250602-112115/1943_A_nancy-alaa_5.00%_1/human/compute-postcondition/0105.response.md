The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then `first` remains True and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
