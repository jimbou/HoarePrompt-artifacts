Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is in `mpp` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 1 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
