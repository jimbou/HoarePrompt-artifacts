The only objects in the loop head are variables  ele and list  l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 2 integers, ele is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the ele is the third integer in the list.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ele` is the third integer in the list, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is an integer, stdin remains empty**
