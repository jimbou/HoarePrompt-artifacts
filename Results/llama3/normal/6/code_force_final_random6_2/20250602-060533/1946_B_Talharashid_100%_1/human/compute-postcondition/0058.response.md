To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the components of the expression inside the `print` function based on the initial state provided:

1. `2 ** k`: This is the result of raising 2 to the power of `k`. Since `k` is an integer, this operation will yield an integer value.

2. `maxi`: This is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list. However, since the list `l` is empty, there are no subarrays, and thus `maxi` will be 0.

3. `sum(l)`: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` will be 0.

4. The entire expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`: Given that `maxi` is 0 and `sum(l)` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007`, which further simplifies to `0 % 1000000007`.

Since any number modulo 1000000007, when the dividend is 0, results in 0, the expression will evaluate to 0.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the result of this calculation.

Output: **0**
