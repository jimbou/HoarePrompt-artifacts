Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, ele is the first integer in the list, c is equal to the original value of c plus ele, maxi is equal to the maximum of the original value of c plus ele and the original value of maxi, stdin is empty. Either ele is not less than 0 or c is larger than the absolute value of ele**

The first line increments `c` by the value of `ele`, making `c` equal to the original value of `c` plus `ele`. The second line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is now equal to the original value of `c` plus `ele`, `maxi` becomes the maximum of the original value of `c` plus `ele` and the original value of `maxi`. No other variables are affected.
