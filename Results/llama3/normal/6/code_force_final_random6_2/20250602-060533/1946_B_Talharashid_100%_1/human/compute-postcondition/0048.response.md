To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 1 integer, `ele` is the first integer in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `l` must have at least 2 integers, and `ele` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ele` is the second integer in the list, `stdin` is empty**
