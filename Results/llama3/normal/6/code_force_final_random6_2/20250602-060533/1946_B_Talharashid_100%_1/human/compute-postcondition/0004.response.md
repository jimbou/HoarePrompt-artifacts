The first line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0, `maxi` remains 0. The second line assigns 0 to `c`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list and is less than 0, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
