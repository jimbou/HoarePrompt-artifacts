The first line increments `c` by the value of `ele`, which is the second element in the list `l`. Since `ele` is the second element in the list, its value is used directly for the calculation. The second line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, its value is assumed to be the maximum value between `c` and the default value of `maxi`, which is not specified.

Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ele is the second element in the list, c is incremented by the value of ele, maxi is the maximum value between c and maxi**
