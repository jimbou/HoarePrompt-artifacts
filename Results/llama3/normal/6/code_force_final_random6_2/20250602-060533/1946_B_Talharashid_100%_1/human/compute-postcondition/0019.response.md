Output: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and the initial value of `maxi`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` which is equivalent to `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007` since `sum(l)` is 0 because `l` is an empty list**
