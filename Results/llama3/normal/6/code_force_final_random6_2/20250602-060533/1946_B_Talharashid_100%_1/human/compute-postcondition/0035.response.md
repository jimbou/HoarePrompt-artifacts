Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the new value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`.**
