Postcondition: ***i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then c and maxi remain 0. Otherwise, c is updated to the sum of its original value and ele, and maxi is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of c, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.***
