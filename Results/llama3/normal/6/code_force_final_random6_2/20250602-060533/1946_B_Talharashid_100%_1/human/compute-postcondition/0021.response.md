Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

The code block executes as follows: 

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs from stdin to `n` and `k`, respectively. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. 

The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. 

The third line resets `c` to 0. 

The fourth line resets `maxi` to 0. 

The print statement is not included in the code block, so it does not affect the output state. 

The value of `i` is not modified by the code block, so it remains 1. 

The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values of the first two inputs from stdin. 

The value of `l` is updated to a list of integers from stdin. 

The value of `c` is reset to 0. 

The value of `maxi` is reset to 0. 

Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
