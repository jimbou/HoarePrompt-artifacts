To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `l` has at least 2 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 1 element, and `ele` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `ele` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list**
