Postcondition: ***i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, ele is the second integer in the list. If ele is negative and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum of c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the new value of c and the original value of maxi. stdin remains empty.***
