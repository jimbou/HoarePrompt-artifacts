Output State: **`i` is equal to the number of test cases, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` will still be integers, and the list `l` will be empty. The variable `c` will be reset to 0, and `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list. For each test case, the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` will be printed.
