Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list, c is the sum of the original value of c and ele, maxi is the maximum value between the original value of maxi and c.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its original value (0) and the value of `ele`. The value of `maxi` has also been updated to be the maximum value between its original value (0) and the new value of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
