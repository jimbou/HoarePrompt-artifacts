Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list) and 0 (the value of `c`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
