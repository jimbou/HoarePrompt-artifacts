Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin is empty**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. The third line assigns 0 to `c`. The fourth line assigns 0 to `maxi`. 

After the execution of the code block, `n` and `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code block.
