Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ele is the third element in the list, c is increased by the value of ele, maxi is the maximum value between the new value of c and the original value of maxi**

In this output state, the value of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the structure of list `l` remain unchanged. The value of `ele` also remains the same as it is still the third element in the list. However, the value of `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and the value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between the new value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`.
