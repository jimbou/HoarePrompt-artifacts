To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it. The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `int(input())` is an expression that reads an integer from the standard input, we can consider it as a variable that represents the number of iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and the initial value of `maxi`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2*maxi - 1) + c`**
