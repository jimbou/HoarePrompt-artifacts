Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and the initial value of `maxi`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum value between 0 (the value of `c`) and its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
