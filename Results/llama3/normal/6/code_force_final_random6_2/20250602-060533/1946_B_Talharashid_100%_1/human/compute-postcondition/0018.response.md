To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

The initial state provides the following information:

*   `i` is 0
*   `n` is an integer
*   `k` is an integer
*   `l` is an empty list
*   `c` is 0
*   `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and the initial value of `maxi`
*   stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs

The Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement:

```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

Now, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

*   `2 ** k`: This calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`, where `k` is an integer.
*   `maxi`: This is the maximum value between 0 and the initial value of `maxi`. Since the initial value of `maxi` is not explicitly provided, we'll keep it as `maxi` in the description.
*   `sum(l)`: This calculates the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` will be 0.
*   `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`: This calculates the result of the expression inside the parentheses modulo 1000000007.

Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Output: **((2^k \* maxi - maxi) % 1000000007) (where k is an integer and maxi is the maximum value between 0 and the initial value of maxi)**
