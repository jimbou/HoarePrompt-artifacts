Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a non-negative number or the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a negative number and the sum of the subarray is greater than the absolute value of the negative number.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `maxi`. The value of `maxi` is now the maximum of its original value and 0, since `c` is 0.
