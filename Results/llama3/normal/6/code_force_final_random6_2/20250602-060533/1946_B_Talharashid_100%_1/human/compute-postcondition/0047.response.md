Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ele` is the first integer in the list, `stdin` is empty. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is equal to the original value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is equal to the maximum of the original value of `c` plus `ele` and the original value of `maxi`.***
