Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains all negative numbers. In this case, the program will not be able to find a subarray with a positive sum, and the variable `maxi` will remain 0. However, the program should still be able to insert the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) into the array, effectively adding 0 to the sum of the array. But the program will not do this, and will instead print the sum of the original array modulo 10^9 + 7, which is not the correct result.

For example, if the input is:

2 2
-4 -7

The program will print 999999996, which is incorrect. The correct result is 999999996, because we can insert the sum of an empty subarray (0) into the array twice, resulting in the array [-4, -7, 0, 0], which has a sum of -11 modulo 10^9 + 7.
