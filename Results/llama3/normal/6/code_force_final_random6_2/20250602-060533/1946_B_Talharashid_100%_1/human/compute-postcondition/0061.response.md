Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list, then prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each test case. The function iterates over all test cases, and after processing all cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables in their final state.**
