Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the third element in the list, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.***
