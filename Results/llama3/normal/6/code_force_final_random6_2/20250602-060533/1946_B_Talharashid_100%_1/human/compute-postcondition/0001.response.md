Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**.

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line is split into two integers, which are assigned to `n` and `k`. The second line is split into a list of integers, which is assigned to `l`. The variables `c` and `maxi` are initialized to 0. The variable `i` remains unchanged, still equal to 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
