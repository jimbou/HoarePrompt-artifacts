Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the new value of `c` and its previous value.***
