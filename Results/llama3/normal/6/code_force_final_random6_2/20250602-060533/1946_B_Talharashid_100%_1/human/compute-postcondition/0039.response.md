Output: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a non-negative number or the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a negative number and the sum of the subarray is greater than the absolute value of the negative number, and this is printed: (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 which is equal to (2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007 = 0**
