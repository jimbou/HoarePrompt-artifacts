The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and their values:

* `i` is 1, but it's not used in the expression, so it doesn't affect the output.
* `n` is an integer, but its value is not specified, so we can't determine its exact value.
* `k` is an integer, but its value is not specified, so we can't determine its exact value.
* `l` is an empty list, so `sum(l)` is 0.
* `c` is 0, but it's not used in the expression, so it doesn't affect the output.
* `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a non-negative number or the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a negative number and the sum of the subarray is greater than the absolute value of the negative number. Since `l` is an empty list, there are no subarrays, so `maxi` is 0.

Now, let's evaluate the expression:

* `2 ** k` is 2 raised to the power of `k`, but since `k` is an integer, this expression will always be an integer.
* `maxi` is 0, so `2 ** k * maxi` is 0.
* `maxi` is 0, so `- maxi` is 0.
* `sum(l)` is 0, since `l` is an empty list.
* The expression becomes `(0 + 0 + 0) % 1000000007`, which is simply 0.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **0**
