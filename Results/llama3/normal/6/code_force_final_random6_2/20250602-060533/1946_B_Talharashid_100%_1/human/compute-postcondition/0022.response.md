To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is 0. So, for the loop to be executed, the list `l` must have at least 1 element and `ele` is the first element in the list.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
