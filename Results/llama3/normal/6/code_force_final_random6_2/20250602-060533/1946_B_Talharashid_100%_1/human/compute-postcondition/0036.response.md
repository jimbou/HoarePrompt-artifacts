Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a non-negative number or the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a negative number and the sum of the subarray is greater than the absolute value of the negative number.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` will be empty because the loop iterates over each element in the list. The variable `c` will be reset to 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever a negative number is encountered and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`. The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a non-negative number or the maximum sum of subarray in `l` that ends with a negative number and the sum of the subarray is greater than the absolute value of the negative number. The variables `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
