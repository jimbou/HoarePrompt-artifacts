Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
