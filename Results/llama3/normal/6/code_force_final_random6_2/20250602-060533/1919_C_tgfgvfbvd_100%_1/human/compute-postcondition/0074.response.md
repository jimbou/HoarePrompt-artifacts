Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.***
