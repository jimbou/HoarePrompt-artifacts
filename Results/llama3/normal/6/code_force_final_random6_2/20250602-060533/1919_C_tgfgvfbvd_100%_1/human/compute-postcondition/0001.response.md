Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer, which was read from the first line of the input. The list `l` contains a list of integers, which were read from the second line of the input. The variables `a` and `b` are both set to positive infinity, and the variable `c` is set to 0. The stdin is now empty, as all the input has been read.
