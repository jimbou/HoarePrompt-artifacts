Output State: **n is greater than 0, x is 0, l is a list of integers, a is the value of the element of l at index x, b is positive infinity, c is 1. The element of l at index x is strictly larger than b.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the value of the element of `l` at index `x`, which is strictly larger than `b`. The value of `c` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
