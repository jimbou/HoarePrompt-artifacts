Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1. If the element of `l` at index `x` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, and the current value of `l[x]` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `a` is the value of the element of `l` at index `x`, `b` is positive infinity, and the element of `l` at index `x` is strictly larger than `b`.***
