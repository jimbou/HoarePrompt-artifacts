The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` is infinity and its current value is greater than `b`, and `b` is also infinity, after the swap, `a` will be equal to the original value of `b` (which is infinity), and `b` will be equal to the original value of `a` (which is infinity and greater than the original value of `b`). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity and greater than its original value, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, stdin is empty**
