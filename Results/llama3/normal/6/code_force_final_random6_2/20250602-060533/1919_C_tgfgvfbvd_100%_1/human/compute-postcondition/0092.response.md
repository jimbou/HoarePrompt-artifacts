Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the original value of `a`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged. However, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. The original value of `b` is now assigned to `a`, and the original value of `a` is now assigned to `b`.
