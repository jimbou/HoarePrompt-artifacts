Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the third element in `l`, `b` is the smallest element in `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is the smallest element in `l` and `b` is the element at index 2 in `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the third element of `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, and `c` is 1.***
