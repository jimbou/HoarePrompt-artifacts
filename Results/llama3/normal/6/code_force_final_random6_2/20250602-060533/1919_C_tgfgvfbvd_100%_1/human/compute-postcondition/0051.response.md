Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `a` > `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. In all cases, the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than or equal to `a` and the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than the original value of `b`.***
