State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is the smallest element in `l` (excluding `l[x]`). Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is the smallest element in `l` and `b` is the element at index `x` in `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in `l`, `b` is the original value of `a`, and `c` is 1. In all cases, the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than or equal to `a` and the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than the original value of `b`.**
