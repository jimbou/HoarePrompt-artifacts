To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for x in range(n):`, which means the only variables that can be adjusted are `x` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `x` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1**
