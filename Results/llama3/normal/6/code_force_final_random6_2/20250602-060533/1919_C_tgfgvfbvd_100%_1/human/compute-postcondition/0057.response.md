The only variable in the loop head is variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, and the input has been reduced by two lines.**
