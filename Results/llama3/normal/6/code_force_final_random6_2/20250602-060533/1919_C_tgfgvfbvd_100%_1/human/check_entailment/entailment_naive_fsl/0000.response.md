Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it implements the optimal strategy for splitting the array into two subsequences to minimize the total penalty. The strategy is to maintain two variables, `a` and `b`, which represent the maximum values of the two subsequences. Initially, `a` and `b` are set to infinity.

The program then iterates through the array, and for each element, it checks if it can be added to either subsequence without increasing the penalty. If the element is less than or equal to `a`, it is added to the first subsequence, and `a` is updated to the element's value. If the element is less than or equal to `b`, it is added to the second subsequence, and `b` is updated to the element's value. If the element is greater than both `a` and `b`, it is added to the first subsequence, and `a` is updated to the element's value, and the penalty counter `c` is incremented.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element, in which case the penalty is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the array has multiple elements, and the optimal strategy is to split the array into two subsequences.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array, and its space complexity is O(1), making it efficient for large inputs.

Overall, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for minimizing the total penalty, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
