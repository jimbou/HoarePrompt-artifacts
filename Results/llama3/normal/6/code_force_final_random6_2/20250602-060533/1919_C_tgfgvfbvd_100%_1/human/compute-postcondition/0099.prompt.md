Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is a list of integers, a is infinity, b is infinity, c is 0, x is n-2, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, stdin is empty. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and no changes are made to the variables. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is 1, and `l[0]` is larger than `b`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]` and no changes are made to the variables. If `l[1]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]` and `c` is 1, and `l[1]` is larger than `b`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]`, `c` is 2. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to `l[1]`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. Additionally, if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and no changes are made to the variables. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is 1, and `l[0]` is larger than `b`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the third element of the list `l`. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`, and if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `a` is the value of the element at index 2 in list `l`, `b` is the value of the element at index 1 in list `l`, and `c` is the value of `c` plus 1. In all cases, if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
