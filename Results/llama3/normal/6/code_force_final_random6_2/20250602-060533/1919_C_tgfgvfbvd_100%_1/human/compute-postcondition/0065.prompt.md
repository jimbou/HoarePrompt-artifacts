Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is the smallest element in l, b is the second smallest element in l, c is 0, and the input has been reduced by two lines
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 0, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is the smallest element in `l` (excluding `l[x]`). Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is the smallest element in `l` and `b` is the element at index `x` in `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in `l`, `b` is the original value of `a`, and `c` is 1. In all cases, the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than or equal to `a` and the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than the original value of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If the element at index `x` in `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to be the element at index `x` in `l`, which is greater than or equal to `a` and greater than the original value of `b`, and `b` is the smallest element in `l`. If the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to be the element at index `x` in `l`, which is greater than or equal to `a` and greater than the original value of `b`. If the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to be the element at index `x` in `l`, which is greater than or equal to the original value of `a` and greater than the original value of `b`, and `c` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the third element in `l`, `b` is the smallest element in `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is the smallest element in `l` and `b` is the element at index 2 in `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the third element of `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, and `c` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
