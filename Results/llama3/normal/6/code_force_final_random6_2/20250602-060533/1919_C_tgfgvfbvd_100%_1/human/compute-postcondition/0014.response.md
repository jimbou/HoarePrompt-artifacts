Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]` and `b` is positive infinity. Otherwise, if the element of `l` at index `x` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is positive infinity and `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If the element of `l` at index `x` is strictly larger than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element of `l` at index `x` and `b` is positive infinity.***
