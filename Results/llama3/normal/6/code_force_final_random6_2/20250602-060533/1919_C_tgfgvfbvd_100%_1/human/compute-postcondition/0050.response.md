Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the original value of `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, and the input has been reduced by two lines.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped, meaning that `a` now holds the original value of `b` and `b` now holds the original value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
