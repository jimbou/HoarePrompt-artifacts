Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (array size) and a list of integers (array elements). It then finds the smallest and second smallest elements in the array, and counts the number of elements greater than the second smallest. The function prints the count of such elements for each test case, and continues until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
