Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the smallest element in `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element, `x` is `n`, stdin is empty, and the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element, which is `c`, has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is that the input size `n` is a non-negative integer, the list `l` contains integers, `a` and `b` hold the smallest and second smallest elements of `l`, respectively, `c` counts the number of elements in `l` greater than the second smallest, `x` has reached the end of the list, the input has been fully processed (stdin is empty), and the count `c` has been printed as output.
