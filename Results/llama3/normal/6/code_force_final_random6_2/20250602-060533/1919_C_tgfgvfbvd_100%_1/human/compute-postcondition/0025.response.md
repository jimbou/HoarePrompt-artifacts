Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `x` is 2, `l` is a list of integers. If `a` > `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. The value of `c` depends on the original values of `a` and `b` and the value of `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of `l[1]`, `b` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[1]`, `b` is the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 1 or 2.***
