Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If the element at index `x` in `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to be the element at index `x` in `l`, which is greater than or equal to `a` and greater than the original value of `b`, and `b` is the smallest element in `l`. If the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to be the element at index `x` in `l`, which is greater than or equal to `a` and greater than the original value of `b`. If the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to be the element at index `x` in `l`, which is greater than or equal to the original value of `a` and greater than the original value of `b`, and `c` is set to 1.***
