Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `b` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1**

The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, after the swap, `a` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`. The values of `n`, `x`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged.
