Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `l` is a list of integers. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is either 1 or 2.***
