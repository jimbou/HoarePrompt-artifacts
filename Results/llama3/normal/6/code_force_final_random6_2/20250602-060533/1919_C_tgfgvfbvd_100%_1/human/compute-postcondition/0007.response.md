Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `l[x]`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
