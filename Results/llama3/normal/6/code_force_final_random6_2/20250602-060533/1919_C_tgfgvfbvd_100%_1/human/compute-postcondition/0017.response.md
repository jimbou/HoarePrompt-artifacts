Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.***
