Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]` and `b` is positive infinity. Otherwise, if the element of `l` at index `x` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is positive infinity and `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If the element of `l` at index `x` is strictly larger than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element of `l` at index `x` and `b` is positive infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `l` is a list of integers. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of `l[1]`, `b` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[x]`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `x` is 2, `l` is a list of integers. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of `l[2]`. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the value of `l[2]`. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of `l[1]`, `b` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 1 or 2. If `a` > `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. The value of `c` depends on the original values of `a` and `b` and the value of `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of `l[1]`, `b` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either positive infinity or the value of `l[1]`, `b` is the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `l[1]`, and `c` is either 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
