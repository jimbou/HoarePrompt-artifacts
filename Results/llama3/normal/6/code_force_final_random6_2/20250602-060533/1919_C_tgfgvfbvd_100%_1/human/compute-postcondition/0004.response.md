The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is greater than `b`. After the swap, `a` will be equal to the initial value of `b`, and `b` will be equal to the initial value of `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0, and the current value of `b` is greater than the current value of `a`.**
