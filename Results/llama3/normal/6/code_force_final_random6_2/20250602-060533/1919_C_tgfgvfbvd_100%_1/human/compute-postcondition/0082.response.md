Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, stdin is empty. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and no changes are made to the variables. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is 1, and `l[0]` is larger than `b`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
