The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 1, stdin is empty. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and no changes are made to the variables. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]` and `c` is 1, and `l[0]` is larger than `b`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `b` is greater than its original value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
