Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`, and if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `a` is the value of the element at index 2 in list `l`, `b` is the value of the element at index 1 in list `l`, and `c` is the value of `c` plus 1.***
