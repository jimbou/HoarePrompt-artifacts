Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are the two smallest elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and the input has been reduced by two lines. If `a` was originally greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a`. The element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `b`***
