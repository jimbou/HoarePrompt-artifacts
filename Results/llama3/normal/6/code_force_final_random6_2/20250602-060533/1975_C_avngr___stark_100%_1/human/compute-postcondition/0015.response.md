Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max is either 0 or an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If temp[1] is greater than the current max, then max is updated to temp[1].**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. These integers are a subset of the list `a`, specifically the elements at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`. The value of `max` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and the middle element of the sorted `temp` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
