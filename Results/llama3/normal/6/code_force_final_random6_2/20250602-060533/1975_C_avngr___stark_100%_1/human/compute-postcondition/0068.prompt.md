Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `n` is 2, otherwise `t-5` test cases, `i` is `n-2`, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is 0, and if `n` is 2, the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 1, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is either 0 or equal to the current value of `temp[1]`, whichever is greater.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is either 0 or equal to the current value of `temp[1]`, whichever is greater. If `temp[1]` is greater than the current value of `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 3, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is either 0 or equal to the current value of `temp[1]`, whichever is greater. If `temp[1]` is greater than the current value of `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
