Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `n` is 2, the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**

In this output state, the variable `max` has been introduced and assigned a value of 0. The other variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The conditional statement regarding `n` being 2 and the smallest integer in the list `a` being printed remains unchanged.
