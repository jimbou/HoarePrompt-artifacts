Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max is temp[1], stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order.**

In this output state, the value of max has been updated to temp[1], which is the second element of the sorted list temp. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the list temp remains sorted in ascending order.
