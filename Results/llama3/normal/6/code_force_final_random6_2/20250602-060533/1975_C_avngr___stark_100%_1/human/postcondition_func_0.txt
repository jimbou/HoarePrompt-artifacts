This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then finds the maximum value of the middle element of all possible sublists of three consecutive integers in the list, excluding the case where n is 2, in which case it simply prints the smaller of the two integers. The function prints the maximum middle value for each test case.
