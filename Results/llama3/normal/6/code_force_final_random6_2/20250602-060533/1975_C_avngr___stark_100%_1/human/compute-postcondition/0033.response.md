The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` to the variable `temp`. The slice starts at index `i` and ends at index `i + 3`. Since `i` is 0, the slice includes the first three elements of the list `a`. The second line sorts the list `temp` in ascending order.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, max is 0**
