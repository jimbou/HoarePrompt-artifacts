The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If n is at least 3, max is the second largest integer in a, otherwise max is 0, and the second largest integer in a is being printed, which is max.**
