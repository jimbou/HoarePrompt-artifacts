Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is the value of `temp[1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` is updated to be the second element of the `temp` list, which is the middle value of the three integers in `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
