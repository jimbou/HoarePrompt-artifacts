Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If n is at least 3, max is the second largest integer in a, otherwise max is 0, and the second largest integer in a is being printed, which is max.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer and is at least 2, this line does not change the fact that `n` is at least 2. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers to `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, this line does not change the fact that `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The value of `t` is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. The value of `_` is also not affected, so it remains 1. The value of `i` is not affected, so it remains `n-2`. The value of `temp` is not affected, so it remains a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. The value of `max` is not affected, so it remains the second largest integer in `a` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise it remains 0. The second largest integer in `a` is being printed, which is `max`. Stdin contains `t-2` test cases initially, and two inputs are read from stdin, so it now contains `t-3` test cases.
