Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 3. The program only checks for the maximum median of subarrays of length 3, but it does not consider the case where the maximum median can be obtained by choosing a subarray of length greater than 3.

In this case, the subarray [1, 2, 3] has a median of 2, but if we choose the subarray [1, 2, 3] and set all its elements to the median of the subarray [1, 2, 3, 3] (which is 3), we can obtain an array with all elements equal to 3, which is the maximum possible value.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
