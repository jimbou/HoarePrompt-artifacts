Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-6 test cases if n is 2, otherwise t-5 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and max is the maximum value of temp[1] from all iterations of the loop. If n is 2, the smallest integer in the list a is being printed and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
