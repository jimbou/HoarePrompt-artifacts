The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max` is either 0 or an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If `temp[1]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.**
