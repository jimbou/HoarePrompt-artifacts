Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 1, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is equal to the current value of `temp[1]`, which is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` has been updated to be equal to the second element of the `temp` list, which is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still between 2 and 500, `_` still 2, `n` still at least 3, `a` still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin still containing `t-5` test cases, `i` still 1, and `temp` still a sorted list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9.
