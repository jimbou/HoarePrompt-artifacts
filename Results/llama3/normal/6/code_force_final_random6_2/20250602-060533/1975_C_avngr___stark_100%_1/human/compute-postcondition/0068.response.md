Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `n` is 2, otherwise `t-5` test cases, `i` is `n-2`, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is the maximum value of `temp[1]` after all iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list `a` from index 0 to `n-3`, and the variable `max` now holds the maximum value of the middle element of all 3-element sublists of `a` that were sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
