Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, and the second line assigns a list of `n` integers to `a`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and each test case consumes two lines from stdin, `t-1` test cases remain in stdin after the code executes. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
