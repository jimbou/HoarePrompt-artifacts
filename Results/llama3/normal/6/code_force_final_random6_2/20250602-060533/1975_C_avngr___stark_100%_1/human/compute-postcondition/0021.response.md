Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 4, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If the middle element of temp is greater than max, then max is the second smallest integer in temp.***
