To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, the condition `i < n - 2` is still satisfied if `n` is at least 5.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 3, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is either 0 or equal to the current value of `temp[1]`, whichever is greater. If `temp[1]` is greater than the current value of `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`.**
