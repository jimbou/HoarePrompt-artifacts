The code assigns the value of `temp[1]` to `max`. Since `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `temp[1]` is the middle value of the list. The value of `max` is now equal to the current value of `temp[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is equal to the current value of `temp[1]`.**
