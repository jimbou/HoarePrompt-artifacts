Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max` is either 0 or an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If `temp[1]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.**
