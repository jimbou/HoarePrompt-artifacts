Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 1, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, max is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` to the variable `temp`. The slice starts at index `i` (which is 1) and ends at index `i + 3` (which is 4). This means that `temp` will now hold the second, third, and fourth elements of the list `a`. The second line sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. 

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `i` is 1, the slice `a[i:i + 3]` will always contain three integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. After sorting, `temp` will still contain these three integers, but in ascending order. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` remains 2, `n` remains an integer and is at least 3, `a` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin remains `t-5` test cases, `i` remains 1, and `max` remains 0.
