To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range is `n - 2`. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0**
