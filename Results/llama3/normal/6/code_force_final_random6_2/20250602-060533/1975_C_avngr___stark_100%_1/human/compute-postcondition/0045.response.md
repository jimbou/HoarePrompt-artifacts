Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and max is the maximum value of temp[1] from all iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and stdin as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-2`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `temp` will still be a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, but its values may have changed during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `max` will hold the maximum value of `temp[1]` from all iterations of the loop, which means it will be the maximum value of the middle element of all sublists of 3 consecutive elements in the list `a`.
