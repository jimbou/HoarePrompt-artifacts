Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If n is at least 3, max is the second largest integer in a, otherwise max is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is as follows: the value of `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same list of integers, and `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-2`. The temporary list `temp` is still a sorted list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If the length of `a` is at least 3, `max` has been updated to the second largest integer in `a`, otherwise it remains 0.
