Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `n` is 2, otherwise `t-5` test cases, `i` is `n-2`, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is 0, and if `n` is 2, the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to 0, while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
