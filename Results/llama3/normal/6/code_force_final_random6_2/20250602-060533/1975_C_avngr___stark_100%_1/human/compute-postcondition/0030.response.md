Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If n is at least 3, max is the second largest integer in a, otherwise max is 0. If n is 2, the second largest integer in a is being printed, which is max, and the smallest integer in the list a is being printed, which is min(a), and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the second largest integer in a is being printed, which is max.***
