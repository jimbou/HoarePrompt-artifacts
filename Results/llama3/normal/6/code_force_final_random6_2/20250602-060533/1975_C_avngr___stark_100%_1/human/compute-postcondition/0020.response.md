Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 2, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is the second smallest integer in `temp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` is now the second smallest integer in the sorted list `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still between 1 and 500, `_` still 0, `n` still at least 4, `a` still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin still containing `t-1` test cases, `i` still 2, and `temp` still a sorted list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9.
