The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. In this case, since the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the code and move on to the next test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of 2 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed**
