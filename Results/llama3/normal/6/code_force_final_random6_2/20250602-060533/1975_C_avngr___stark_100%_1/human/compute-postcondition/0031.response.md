Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `n-2`, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `n` being at least 3, and the printing of the second largest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` when `n` is 2, are still valid.
