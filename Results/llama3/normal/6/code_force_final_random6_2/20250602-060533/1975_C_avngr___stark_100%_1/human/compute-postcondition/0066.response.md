Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 3, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is equal to `temp[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be equal to the value of `temp[1]`, which is the middle element of the sorted list `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
