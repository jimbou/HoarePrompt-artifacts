To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must still be at least 3 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is either 0 or the value of `temp[1]`**
