Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, `max` is the value of `temp[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to the value of `temp[1]`, which is the middle element of the sorted list `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
