Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `n` is 2, the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max` is either 0 or an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If `temp[1]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If temp[1] is greater than the current max, then max is updated to temp[1], otherwise max remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 4, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If the middle element of temp is greater than max, then max is the second smallest integer in temp.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
