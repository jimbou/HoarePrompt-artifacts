Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-6 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and max is the maximum value of temp[1] from all iterations of the loop, and the smallest integer in the list a is being printed and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `i`, `temp`, and `max` remain unchanged. The only change is that the current iteration is skipped, and the loop moves on to the next one.
