The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. So, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
