Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and max is the maximum value of temp[1] from all iterations of the loop.**

The code reads an integer `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`, overwriting its previous value. It then reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns the list to the variable `a`. This operation consumes two lines from stdin, leaving `t-5` test cases remaining. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `temp`, and `max` remain unchanged.
