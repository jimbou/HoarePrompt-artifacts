Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. If n is at least 3, max is the second largest integer in a, otherwise max is 0, and the second largest integer in a is being printed, which is max.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and max is the maximum value of temp[1] from all iterations of the loop, and the maximum value of temp[1] from all iterations of the loop which is max is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `n` is 2, otherwise `t-5` test cases, `i` is `n-2`, `temp` is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and `max` is the maximum value of `temp[1]` after all iterations of the loop, and the maximum value of `temp[1]` which is max is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
