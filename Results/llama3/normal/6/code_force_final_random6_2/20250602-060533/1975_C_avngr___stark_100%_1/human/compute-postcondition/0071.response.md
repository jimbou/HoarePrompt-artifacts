Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, _ is t, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is n-2, temp is a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and max is the maximum value of temp[1] after all iterations of the loop, and the maximum value of temp[1] which is max is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 500 inclusive, the variable `_` will be equal to `t`, the variable `n` will be an integer and at least 2, the variable `a` will be a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, there will be no more test cases in stdin, the variable `i` will be `n-2`, the variable `temp` will be a list of 3 integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order, and the variable `max` will be the maximum value of `temp[1]` after all iterations of the loop, and this maximum value will be printed.
