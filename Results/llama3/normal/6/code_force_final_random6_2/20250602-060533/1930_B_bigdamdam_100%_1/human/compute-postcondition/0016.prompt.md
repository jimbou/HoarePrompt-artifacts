Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` numbers where every other element starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, `ind` is 1 if `n` is odd and 3 if `n` is even, `i` is `n-2` or `n`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    p[i] = ind
    ind += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 3, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the element at index 1 which is 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, ind is 3 if n is odd and 5 if n is even, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 3, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the elements at index 1 and 3 which are 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, ind is 5 if n is odd and 7 if n is even, i is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 6, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the elements at index 1 and 3 which are 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, except the element at index 5 which is 5 if n is odd and 7 if n is even, ind is 7 if n is odd and 9 if n is even, i is 5, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
