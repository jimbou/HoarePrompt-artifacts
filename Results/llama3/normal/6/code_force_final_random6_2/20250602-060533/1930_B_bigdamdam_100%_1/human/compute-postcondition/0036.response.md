The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p`. The list `p` contains `n` integers, where every other element starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, ..., `0` or `1`, and the rest are zeros except for the odd-indexed elements which are `1`, `3`, `5`, ..., `n-1`.

Since `n` is at least `1`, the list `p` will have at least one element. The first element will be `n-2`, the second element will be `1`, the third element will be `n-4`, the fourth element will be `3`, and so on.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the list `p` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers, where every other number starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, ..., `0` or `1`, and the rest are `1`, `3`, `5`, ..., `n-1`.

Output: **n-2, 1, n-4, 3, n-6, 5, ..., 0 or 1, n-1**
