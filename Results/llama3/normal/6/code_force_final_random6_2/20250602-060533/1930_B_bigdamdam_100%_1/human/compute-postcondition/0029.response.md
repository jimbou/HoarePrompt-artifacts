According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 0 or 1, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines**
