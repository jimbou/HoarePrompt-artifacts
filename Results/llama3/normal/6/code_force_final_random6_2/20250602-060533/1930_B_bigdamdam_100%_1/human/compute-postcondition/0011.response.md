Output State: **n is at least 3, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the element at index 1 which is 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, ind is 3 if n is odd and 5 if n is even, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `p` is modified at index `i` (which is 1) to be equal to `ind` (which is 1 if `n` is odd and 3 if `n` is even). The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, making it 3 if `n` is odd and 5 if `n` is even. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The state of stdin is also unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
