Output State: **n is a positive integer, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, ind is equal to 0 or 2, i is n-2 or n, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list p has every other element starting from the first set to decreasing values starting from n-2, and the rest of the elements are zeros. The value of ind is either 0 or 2, and the value of i is either n-2 or n. The state of stdin remains unchanged.
