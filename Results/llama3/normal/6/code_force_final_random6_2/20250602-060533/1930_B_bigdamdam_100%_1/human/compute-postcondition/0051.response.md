Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, i is 3, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, and the element at index i is ind, ind is ind + 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not changed by the code. The list `p` is modified at index `i` to be equal to `ind`. The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. The state of `stdin` is not affected by the code as it does not read or write to it.
