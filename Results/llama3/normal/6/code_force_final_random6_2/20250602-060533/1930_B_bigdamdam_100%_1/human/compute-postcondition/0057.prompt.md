Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 3, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the elements at index 1, 3, 5, and so on until the last element which is n-2 or n, which are 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, ind is n if n is odd and n+2 if n is even, i is n-2 or n, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line, and the list p is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 1, i is n-1, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 0 or 1, and the rest are zeros except for the odd-indexed elements which are 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1, ind is n, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines, and the list p is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n-1 if n is odd and n-2 if n is even, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, and the elements at indices 1, 3, 5, and so on, are 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, ind is n if n is even and n-1 if n is odd, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line, and the list p is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
