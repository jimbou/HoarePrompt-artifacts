The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is at least 5, `p` is a list of n numbers where the first element is n-2, the third element is n-2, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to n-4, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line**
