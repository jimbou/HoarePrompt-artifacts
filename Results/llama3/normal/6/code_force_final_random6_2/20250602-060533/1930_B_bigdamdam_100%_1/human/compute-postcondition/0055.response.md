Based on the precondition, let's break down the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.
* `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd and `n-2` if `n` is even.
* `p` is a list of `n` integers with the following pattern:
	+ Every other element starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, and so on.
	+ The rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 if `n` is even and 0 if `n` is odd.
	+ The elements at indices 1, 3, 5, and so on, are 1 if `n` is even and 0 if `n` is odd.
* `ind` is `n` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(*p)`

The `*` operator unpacks the list `p` into separate arguments to the `print` function. Therefore, the print statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `p`. However, based on the pattern described in the precondition, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **A list of n integers, where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, and the elements at indices 1, 3, 5, and so on, are 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, separated by spaces.**
