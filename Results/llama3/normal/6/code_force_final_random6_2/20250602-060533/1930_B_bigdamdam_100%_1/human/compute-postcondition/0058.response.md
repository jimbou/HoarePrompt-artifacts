Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of an array. For each test case, the function generates an array of size n, where every other element starting from the first is assigned a value from the sequence n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., and the remaining elements are assigned values from the sequence 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1. The function then prints each generated array. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input stream empty.**
