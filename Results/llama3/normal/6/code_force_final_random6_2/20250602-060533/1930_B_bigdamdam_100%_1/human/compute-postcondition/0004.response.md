According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `p` is a list of n numbers where the first element is n-2 and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to n-2, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line**
