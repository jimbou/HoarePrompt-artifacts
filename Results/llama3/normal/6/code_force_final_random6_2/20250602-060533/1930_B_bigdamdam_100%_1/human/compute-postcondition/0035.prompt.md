Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 0 or 1, and the rest are zeros, ind is 1, i is n-2 or n, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    p[i] = ind
    ind += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 3, i is 1, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 0 or 1, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1, ind is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 3, i is 3, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 0 or 1, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 and the i-th element which is 3, ind is 5, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 5, i is 5, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, ..., 0 or 1, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 and the i-th element which is 5, ind is 7, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
