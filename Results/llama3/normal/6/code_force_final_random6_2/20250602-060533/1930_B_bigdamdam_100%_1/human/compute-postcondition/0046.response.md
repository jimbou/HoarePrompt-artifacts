Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on, and the rest are zeros, ind is -n if n is even and -n+1 if n is odd, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line, and the list p is not being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, the list `p` will have every other element starting from the first set to decreasing values starting from `n-2`, and the rest of the elements will be zeros. The value of `ind` will be either `-n` if `n` is even or `-n+1` if `n` is odd. The state of `stdin` and the fact that the list `p` is not being printed remain unchanged.
