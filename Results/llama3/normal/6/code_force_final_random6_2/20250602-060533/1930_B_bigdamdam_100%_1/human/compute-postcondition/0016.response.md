Output State: **n is at least 3, p is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the elements at index 1, 3, 5, and so on until the last element which is n-2 or n, which are 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, ind is n if n is odd and n+2 if n is even, i is n-2 or n, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `p` will have all its odd-indexed elements (starting from index 1) filled with either 1 (if `n` is odd) or 3 (if `n` is even), while the even-indexed elements remain unchanged. The variable `ind` will be equal to `n` if `n` is odd and `n+2` if `n` is even, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n-2` or `n`. The state of `n` and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
