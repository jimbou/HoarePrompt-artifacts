Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` numbers where every other element starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, `ind` is 1 if `n` is odd and 3 if `n` is even, `i` is `n-2` or `n`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.**

In this output state, the value of `ind` has been updated based on the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, `ind` is now 1, and if `n` is even, `ind` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
