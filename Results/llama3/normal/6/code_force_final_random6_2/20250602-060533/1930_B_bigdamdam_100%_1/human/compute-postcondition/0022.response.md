Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, p is a list of n integers where the first element is n-2 and the rest are zeros, ind is n-2, i is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines.**

The first line assigns the value of `ind` to the first element of the list `p`. Since `ind` is `n`, the first element of `p` becomes `n`. The second line decrements `ind` by 2, making it `n-2`. No other variables are affected.
