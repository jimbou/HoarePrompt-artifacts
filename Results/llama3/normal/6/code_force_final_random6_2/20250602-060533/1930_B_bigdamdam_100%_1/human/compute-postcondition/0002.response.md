To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the step size is 2). Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but we need to make sure it's at least 2 for the loop to execute. We also need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is equal to n, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line**
