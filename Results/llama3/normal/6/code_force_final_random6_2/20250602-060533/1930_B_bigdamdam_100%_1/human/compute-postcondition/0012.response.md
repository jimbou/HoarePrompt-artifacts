To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration (since the step size is 2).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `p` and `ind` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

The state of `stdin` is not modified in the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `p` is a list of n numbers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element which is 0 or 2, except the element at index 1 which is 1 if n is odd and 3 if n is even, `ind` is 3 if n is odd and 5 if n is even, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line.**
