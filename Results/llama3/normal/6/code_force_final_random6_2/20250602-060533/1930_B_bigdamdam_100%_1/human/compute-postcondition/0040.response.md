To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the step size is 2). 

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is `n`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line, and the list `p` is not being printed**
