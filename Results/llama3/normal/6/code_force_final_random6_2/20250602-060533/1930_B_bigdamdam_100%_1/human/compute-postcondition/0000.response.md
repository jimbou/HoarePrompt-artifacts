To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must evaluate to a value that allows the loop to run at least once.

Given that `int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input (`stdin`), we need to ensure that this input is provided and is a positive integer, as the loop will run from 0 up to but not including this value.

Since the problem statement mentions that the first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3), we can infer that this `t` is the value that `int(input())` will read. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be 0, as it will iterate from 0 up to but not including the value of `t`.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple lines of input where the first line contains a single integer `t` that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
