To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since the range starts from 0 and increments by 2). Before the loop starts, `i` is either `n-1` or `n+1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be within the range defined by `range(0, n, 2)`, which means `i` should be 0 (the starting point of the range). Additionally, `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is n, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first two lines.**
