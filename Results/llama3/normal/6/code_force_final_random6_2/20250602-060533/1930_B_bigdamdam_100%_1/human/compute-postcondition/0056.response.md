Output: **n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n-1 if n is odd and n-2 if n is even, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, and the elements at indices 1, 3, 5, and so on, are 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd, ind is n if n is even and n-1 if n is odd, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus the first line, and the list p is being printed.**
