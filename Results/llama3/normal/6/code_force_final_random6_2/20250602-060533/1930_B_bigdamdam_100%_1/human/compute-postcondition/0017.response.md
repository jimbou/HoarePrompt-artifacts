The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p`. Based on the precondition, the list `p` contains `n` numbers, where every other element starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, and so on until the last element which is `0` or `2`. The elements at index `1`, `3`, `5`, and so on until the last element which is `n-2` or `n` are `1` if `n` is odd and `3` if `n` is even.

Since `n` is at least `3`, the list `p` will have at least three elements. The first element will be `n-2`, the second element will be `1` if `n` is odd or `3` if `n` is even, and the third element will be `n-4`.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the elements of the list `p` and print them separately.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers, where every other number starting from the first is decreasing by `2` until it reaches `0` or `2`, and the remaining numbers are either `1` or `3` depending on whether `n` is odd or even.

Output: **A sequence of numbers, where every other number starting from the first is decreasing by 2 until it reaches 0 or 2, and the remaining numbers are either 1 or 3 depending on whether n is odd or even.**
