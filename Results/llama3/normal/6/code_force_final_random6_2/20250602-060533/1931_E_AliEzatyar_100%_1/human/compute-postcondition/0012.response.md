Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the index of the third last digit of `num`. If the second last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `num` and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. If the second last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` is now 2. Otherwise, `counter` is now 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
