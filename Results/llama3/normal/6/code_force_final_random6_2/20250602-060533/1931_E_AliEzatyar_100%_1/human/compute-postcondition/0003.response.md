The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `counter` was 0, so the value of `counter` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 1, `i` is the index of the last digit of `num`, and the current value of the last digit of `num` at index `i` is '0'.

Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 1, `i` is the index of the last digit of `num`, and the current value of the last digit of `num` at index `i` is '0'.**
