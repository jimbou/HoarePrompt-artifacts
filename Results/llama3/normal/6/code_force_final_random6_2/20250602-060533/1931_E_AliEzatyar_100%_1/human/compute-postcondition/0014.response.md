Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the index of the third last digit of `num`. If the second last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` is 2. If the second last digit of `num` is not '0' and the third last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` is 1. If the second last digit of `num` is not '0' and the third last digit of `num` is not '0', then `counter` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
