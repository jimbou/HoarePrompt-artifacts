To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. The loop will execute as long as `num` has at least one digit. Since `num` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, it can have 1 to 4 digits. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to have at least one digit.

State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 0, `i` is the index of the last digit of `num`**
