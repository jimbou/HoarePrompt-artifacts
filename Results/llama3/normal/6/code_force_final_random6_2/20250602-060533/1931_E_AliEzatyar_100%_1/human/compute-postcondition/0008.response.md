Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the index of the second last digit of `num`, `counter` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The index `i` still points to the second last digit of the integer `num`.
