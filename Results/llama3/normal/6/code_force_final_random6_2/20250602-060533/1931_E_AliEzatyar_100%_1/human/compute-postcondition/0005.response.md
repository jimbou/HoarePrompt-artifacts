Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 0, `i` is the index of the last digit of `num`, and the last digit of `num` is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The last digit of `num` is still not '0', as this condition was part of the initial state and has not been altered by the code.
