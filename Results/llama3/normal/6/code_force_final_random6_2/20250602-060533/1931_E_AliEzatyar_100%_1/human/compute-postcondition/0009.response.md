Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the index of the second last digit of `num`, `counter` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables.
