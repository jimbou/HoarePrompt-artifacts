Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is -1, `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `num` remains unchanged as an integer with at least one digit, `i` becomes -1 (since the loop iterates from the last index of `num` down to -1), and `counter` counts the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
