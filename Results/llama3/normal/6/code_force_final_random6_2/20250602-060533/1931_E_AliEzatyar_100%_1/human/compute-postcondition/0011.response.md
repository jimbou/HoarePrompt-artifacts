The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the second last digit of `num`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1. So `i` is the index of the third last digit of `num`.
State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the index of the third last digit of `num`. If the second last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
