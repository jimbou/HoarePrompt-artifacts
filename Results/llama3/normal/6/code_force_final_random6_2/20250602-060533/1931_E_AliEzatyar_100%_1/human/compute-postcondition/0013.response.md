Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the index of the third last digit of `num`. If the second last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional effect of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged, and the condition for `counter` is still dependent on the second last digit of `num`. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which was already the case for the initial state when the second last digit of `num` is not '0'.
