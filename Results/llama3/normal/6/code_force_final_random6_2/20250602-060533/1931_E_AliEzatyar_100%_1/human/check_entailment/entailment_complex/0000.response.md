Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first calculates the total number of digits in the input array.
2. It then counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer in the array and stores them in the `zeros` list.
3. The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order, and then the program subtracts the sum of every other element (starting from the first) from the total number of digits. This effectively simulates Anna's moves, where she reverses the integers with the most trailing zeros.
4. The program then checks if the resulting number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer by iterating from the end of the string representation of the integer and counting the consecutive zeros.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
