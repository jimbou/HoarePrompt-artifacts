Postcondition: ***start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a). If cycle_start is not -1, score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 for remainder_steps times, current_pos is the value of p at index p[current_pos - 1] - 1, remainder_steps is 0, all other variables remain unchanged. If cycle_start is -1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
