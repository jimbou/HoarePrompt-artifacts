Output: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 4]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 3]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 1]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 3t]` to `data[index - 2t - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 2t]` to `data[index - t - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and has at least three elements, `result` is the third result in the list, `index` is equal to `index + 4t`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty, and the third result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` which is the value of `result` is being printed**
