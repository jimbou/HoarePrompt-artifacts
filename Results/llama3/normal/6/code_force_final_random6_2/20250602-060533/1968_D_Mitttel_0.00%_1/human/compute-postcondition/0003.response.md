To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `t` is greater than the current iteration.

Since the loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 (since the current iteration has already been executed).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4]` to `data[index + 4 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4 + n]` to `data[index + 4 + 2n - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `index` is equal to `index + 4 + 2n`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `t`, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
