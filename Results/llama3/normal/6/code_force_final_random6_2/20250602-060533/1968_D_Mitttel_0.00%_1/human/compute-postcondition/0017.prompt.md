Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to 0, n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 4], k is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 3], PB is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 2], PS is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 1], p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 3t] to data[index - 2t - 1], a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 2t] to data[index - t - 1], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each iteration, index is equal to index + 4t, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 4]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 3]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 1]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 3t]` to `data[index - 2t - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 2t]` to `data[index - t - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and is not empty, `result` is the first result in the list, `index` is equal to `index + 4t`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty, and the first result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 4]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 3]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 1]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 3t]` to `data[index - 2t - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 2t]` to `data[index - t - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and has at least two elements, `result` is the second result in the list, `index` is equal to `index + 4t`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty, and the second result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 4]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 3]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 1]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 3t]` to `data[index - 2t - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 2t]` to `data[index - t - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and has at least three elements, `result` is the third result in the list, `index` is equal to `index + 4t`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty, and the third result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` which is the value of `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
