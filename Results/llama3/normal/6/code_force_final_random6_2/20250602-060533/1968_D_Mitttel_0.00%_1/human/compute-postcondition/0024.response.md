Output State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length is k - cycle_start, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index p[p[p...[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1 with k - cycle_start number of p's, _ is k - cycle_start - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop head variable `_` is equal to `k - cycle_start - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `k - cycle_start` times. The loop body variables `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` have been updated accordingly. `cycle_score` is the sum of the values of `a` at indices `cycle_pos - 1` for each iteration of the loop, and `cycle_pos` is the value of `p` at index `cycle_pos - 1` after `k - cycle_start` iterations.
