Output State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is the value of p at index p[current_pos - 1] - 1, steps is 0, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length is k - cycle_start, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index p[p[p...[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1 with k - cycle_start number of p's, _ is 0, remainder_steps must be greater than 0**

The code increments the `score` by the value of `a` at index `current_pos - 1`, and then updates `current_pos` to be the value of `p` at index `current_pos - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
