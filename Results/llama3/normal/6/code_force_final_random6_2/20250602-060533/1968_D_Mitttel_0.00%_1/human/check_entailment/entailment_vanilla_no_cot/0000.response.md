Correctness: **False** 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the cycle length is greater than the remaining steps. In this case, the program should only add the score for the remaining steps, but it adds the score for the full cycle instead.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
        return score
    else:
        return score
```

This corrected code will now correctly handle the case when the cycle length is greater than the remaining steps.
