Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" problem. It uses a combination of functions to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha, taking into account the permutation and array values, as well as the game duration.

The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the case where the game duration is less than the length of the permutation, and also handles the case where the game duration is greater than the length of the permutation by identifying cycles in the permutation and calculating the score accordingly.

The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the winner or a draw.

The `func_2` function correctly reads the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
