#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the total score after traversing a path defined by the list `p` and accumulating values from the list `a`, starting from a given position `start_pos` and taking a specified number of steps `k`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, parses it into integers and lists of integers, calls the function func_1 with the parsed input, and prints the results. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with the first integer representing the number of test cases, followed by the input for each test case. The function does not modify the input data, but rather processes it and prints the results. The final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the results have been printed, with the standard input being empty.
