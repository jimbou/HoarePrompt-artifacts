Output State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length must be at least 1, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1, _ is 0**

The code increments the `cycle_score` by the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos - 1`, and then updates `cycle_pos` to be the value of `p` at index `cycle_pos - 1`. No other variables are affected.
