Output State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length is at least 3, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1 plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1 plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index p[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1, _ is 2**

In this output state, the values of `start_pos`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `len(p)`, `len(a)`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, and `_` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `cycle_score` has been incremented by the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos - 1` twice, and the value of `cycle_pos` has been updated to the value of `p` at index `p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1`.
