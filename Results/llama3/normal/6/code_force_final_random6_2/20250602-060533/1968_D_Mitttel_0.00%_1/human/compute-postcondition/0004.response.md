Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, k is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 1]`, PB is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 2]`, PS is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 3]`, p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4]` to `data[index + 4 + n - 1]`, a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4 + n]` to `data[index + 4 + 2n - 1]`, results is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, index is equal to `index + 4 + 2n`, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code block executes a series of assignments and function calls, ultimately updating the values of several variables and appending a result to the `results` list. The initial state provides the context for these operations, including the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `results`, `index`, `data`, and `stdin`.

The first four lines assign the values from `data` to `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS`, respectively. These assignments update the values of these variables based on the corresponding values in the `data` list.

The next two lines increment the `index` by 4, effectively moving the pointer to the next set of values in the `data` list. The following two lines assign the values from `data` to `p` and `a`, respectively, using the updated `index` values. These assignments update the values of `p` and `a` based on the corresponding values in the `data` list.

The final two lines call the `func_1` function with the updated values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, and append the result to the `results` list. This operation updates the `results` list by adding the result of the function call.

Overall, the code block updates the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, and `results`, and increments the `index` by `4 + 2n`. The final state reflects these changes, while maintaining the initial values of `t`, `data`, and `stdin`.
