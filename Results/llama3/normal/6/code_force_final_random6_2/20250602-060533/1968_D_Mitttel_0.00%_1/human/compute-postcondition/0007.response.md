Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to 0, n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 4], k is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 3], PB is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 2], PS is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 1], p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 3t] to data[index - 2t - 1], a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 2t] to data[index - t - 1], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each iteration, index is equal to index + 4t, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of n, k, PB, PS, p, and a are updated to their respective values at the end of the loop. The results list contains the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each iteration of the loop. The index has been incremented by 4 times the original value of t, and the data list remains unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
