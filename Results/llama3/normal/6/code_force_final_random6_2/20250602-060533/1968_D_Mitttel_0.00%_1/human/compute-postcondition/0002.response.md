Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index], k is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index + 1], PB is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index + 2], PS is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index + 3], p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index + 4] to data[index + 4 + n - 1], a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index + 4 + n] to data[index + 4 + 2n - 1], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a), index is equal to index + 4 + 2n, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` have been updated based on the values extracted from the `data` list. The `results` list now contains the result of the `func_1` function call with the updated values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The `index` variable has been incremented by 4 plus twice the value of `n`, reflecting the number of elements extracted from the `data` list. The `data` list remains unchanged, and the `stdin` remains empty.
