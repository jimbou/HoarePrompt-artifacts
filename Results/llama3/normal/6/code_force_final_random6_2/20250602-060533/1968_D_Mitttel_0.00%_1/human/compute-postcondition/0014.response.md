The only variable in the loop head is variable `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least two elements, `result` is the second result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `result` is the third result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 4]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 3]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 1]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 3t]` to `data[index - 2t - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 2t]` to `data[index - t - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and has at least three elements, `result` is the third result in the list, `index` is equal to `index + 4t`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty, and the third result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is being printed**
