Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, p is a list of positive integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all i, a is a list of positive integers, results is an empty list, index is 1, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, excluding the first element which was the original value of t, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    PB = int(data[index + 2])
    PS = int(data[index + 3])
    index += 4
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index], k is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index + 1], PB is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index + 2], PS is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index + 3], p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index + 4] to data[index + 4 + n - 1], a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index + 4 + n] to data[index + 4 + 2n - 1], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a), index is equal to index + 4 + 2n, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, k is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 1]`, PB is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 2]`, PS is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 3]`, p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4]` to `data[index + 4 + n - 1]`, a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4 + n]` to `data[index + 4 + 2n - 1]`, results is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, index is equal to `index + 4 + 2n`, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4n - 4], k is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4n - 3], PB is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4n - 2], PS is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4n - 1], p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 3n] to data[index - 2n - 1], a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 2n] to data[index - n - 1], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) from the previous execution, index is equal to index + 4n, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
