Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the second result in the `results` list, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the second iteration.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the result. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function `func_1` for the second iteration.

Output: **the second result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) (where n is the value at data[index - 4t - 4], k is the value at data[index - 4t - 3], PB is the value at data[index - 4t - 2], PS is the value at data[index - 4t - 1], p is the list of values from data[index - 3t] to data[index - 2t - 1], and a is the list of values from data[index - 2t] to data[index - t - 1])**
