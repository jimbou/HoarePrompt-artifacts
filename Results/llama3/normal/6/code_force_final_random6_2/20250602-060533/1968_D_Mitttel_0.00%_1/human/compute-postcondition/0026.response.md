According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0.

State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `len(p)` = `len(a)`, `score` is the original score plus the sum of the values of `a` at indices `current_pos` - 1 plus `full_cycles` times `cycle_score`, `current_pos` is the value of `p` at index `current_pos` - 1, `steps` is 0, `visited` is a dictionary containing the `current_pos` as a key and the original steps as its value, `cycle_start` is the original steps and is not equal to -1, `cycle_length` is `k` - `cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the original cycle_score plus the sum of the values of `a` at indices `cycle_pos` - 1, `cycle_pos` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p...[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1` with `k` - `cycle_start` number of `p`'s, `_` is 0, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
