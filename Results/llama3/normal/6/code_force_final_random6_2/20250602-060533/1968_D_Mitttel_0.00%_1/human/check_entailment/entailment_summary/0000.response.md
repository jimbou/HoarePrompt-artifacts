Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on a permutation and an array. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. 

`func_1` compares the scores of two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on their respective scores calculated by the function `calculate_score`. It returns the name of the player with the higher score, or 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

`calculate_score` calculates the total score after traversing a path defined by the list `p` and accumulating values from the list `a`, starting from a given position `start_pos` and taking a specified number of steps `k`. If a cycle is detected during the traversal, the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by utilizing the cycle's score and length.

`func_2` reads input from standard input, parses it into integers and lists of integers, calls the function `func_1` with the parsed input, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given permutation and array. It handles cycles in the permutation and calculates the scores correctly. The input is read and parsed correctly, and the results are printed as expected.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
