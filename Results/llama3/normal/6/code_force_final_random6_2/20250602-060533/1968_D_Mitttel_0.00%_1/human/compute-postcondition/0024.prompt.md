Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length is k - cycle_start, cycle_score is 0, cycle_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cycle_length):
    cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
    cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length must be at least 1, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index cycle_pos - 1, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length is at least 2, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1 plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps and is not equal to -1, cycle_length is at least 3, cycle_score is the original cycle_score plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1 plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1 plus the value of a at index cycle_pos - 1, cycle_pos is the value of p at index p[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1, _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
