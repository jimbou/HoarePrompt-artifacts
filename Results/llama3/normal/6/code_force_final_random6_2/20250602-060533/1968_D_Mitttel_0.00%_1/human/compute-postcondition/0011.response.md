To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for result in results:`.

The only object in the loop head is the `results` list and the `result` variable. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second time.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and is not empty, and `result` is the first result in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least two elements, and the `result` variable must be the second result in the list.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 4]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 3]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index - 4t - 1]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 3t]` to `data[index - 2t - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index - 2t]` to `data[index - t - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and has at least two elements, `result` is the second result in the list, `index` is equal to `index + 4t`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty, and the second result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is being printed**
