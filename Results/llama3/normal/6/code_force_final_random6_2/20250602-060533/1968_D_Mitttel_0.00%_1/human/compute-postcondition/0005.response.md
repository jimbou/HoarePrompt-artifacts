To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means it's not used anywhere in the loop body.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `t` is a positive integer greater than 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than the current iteration number. Since the loop has already executed once, the current iteration number is 1. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

The state of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `results`, `index`, `data`, and `stdin`) does not affect the execution of the loop, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4]` to `data[index + 4 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of positive integers equal to the values from `data[index + 4 + n]` to `data[index + 4 + 2n - 1]`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `index` is equal to `index + 4 + 2n`, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `stdin` is empty**
