Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on a permutation and an array. The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in the permutation and move simultaneously for a certain number of turns. The player with the higher score at the end of the game wins.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` calculates the scores of Bodya and Sasha and determines the winner based on their scores. `func_2` calculates the score of a player given their starting position, the number of turns, the permutation, and the array. `func_3` reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case.

The program correctly implements the game logic and handles different scenarios, such as when a player stays at the same position or moves to a different position. It also correctly calculates the scores of the players and determines the winner.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program:

1.  The program assumes that the input is valid and does not contain any errors. If the input is invalid, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
2.  The program uses a dictionary to keep track of visited positions, which can be inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a set to keep track of visited positions.
3.  The program does not handle the case where the number of turns is zero. In this case, the program should return "Draw" as the result.

Despite these potential issues, the program is generally correct and should produce the correct results for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
