State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `len(p)` = `len(a)`, `score` is the original score plus the sum of the values of `a` at indices `current_pos` - 1, `current_pos` is the value of `p` at index `current_pos` - 1, `steps` is `k`, `visited` is a dictionary containing the `current_pos` as a key and the original steps as its value, `cycle_start` is the original steps and is not equal to -1, `cycle_length` is at least 3, `cycle_score` is the original cycle_score plus the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos` - 1 plus the value of `a` at index `cycle_pos` - 1, `cycle_pos` is the value of `p` at index `p[cycle_pos - 1]` - 1, `_` is 2**
