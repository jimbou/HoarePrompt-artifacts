Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to certain rules, accumulating scores based on the values at their positions. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha based on their respective scores calculated by `func_2`. It returns the name of the player with the higher score or 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

`func_2` calculates the total score after traversing a path defined by the list `p` and accumulating values from the list `a`, starting from a given position `start_pos` and taking a specified number of steps `k`. If a cycle is detected during the traversal, the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by utilizing the cycle's score and length.

`func_3` reads input from standard input, parses it into integers and lists of integers, calls `func_1` with the parsed input, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" problem. It accurately calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha, handles cycles in the permutation, and prints the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
