You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Return Postconditions: Case_1: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a), score is the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1, current_pos is the value of p at index current_pos - 1, steps is k, visited is a dictionary containing the current_pos as a key and the original steps as its value, cycle_start is the original steps if current_pos is in visited, otherwise it remains -1.

Case_2: The program returns the score, which is either the original score (if cycle_start is -1) or the original score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 plus full_cycles times cycle_score plus the sum of the values of a at indices current_pos - 1 for remainder_steps times (if cycle_start is not -1).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
