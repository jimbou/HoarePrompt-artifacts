Output State: **score is the original score plus the sum of the values of `a` at indices `current_pos` - 1 plus `full_cycles` times `cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is the value of `p` at index `p[current_pos - 1]` - 1, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `score` has been incremented by the value of `a` at the current position minus one. The value of `current_pos` has been updated to the value of `p` at the index `current_pos` minus one. The value of `remainder_steps` remains decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
