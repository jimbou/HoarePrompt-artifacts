The code prints the third result in the list `results`, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the third iteration.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the result. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function `func_1` for the third iteration.

Output: **the third result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) (where n is the value at data[index - 4t - 4], k is the value at data[index - 4t - 3], PB is the value at data[index - 4t - 2], PS is the value at data[index - 4t - 1], p is the list of values from data[index - 3t] to data[index - 2t - 1], and a is the list of values from data[index - 2t] to data[index - t - 1])**
