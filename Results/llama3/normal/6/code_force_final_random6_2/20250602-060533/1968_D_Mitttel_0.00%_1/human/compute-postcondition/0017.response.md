Output State: **t is 0, n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 4], k is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 3], PB is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 2], PS is a positive integer equal to the value at data[index - 4t - 1], p is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 3t] to data[index - 2t - 1], a is a list of positive integers equal to the values from data[index - 2t] to data[index - t - 1], results is an empty list, index is equal to index + 4t, data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, stdin is empty, and all results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) have been printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the results of the function func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) have been printed, and the loop has finished executing. The values of the variables t, n, k, PB, PS, p, a, index, and data remain unchanged, and the list results is empty because all its elements have been printed. The stdin remains empty.
