Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least as many test cases as the length of test_cases, n is the number of integers in the last test case, x is the first integer in the last test case, y is the second integer in the last test case, arr is the list of integers in the last test case that must have at least n integers, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for each test case, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for the last test case, mod_x_map is a dictionary with the key mod_x_key and value n, mod_y_map is a dictionary with the key mod_y_key and value n, num is the last integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `test_cases` list has been fully processed, and the `results` list contains the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each test case. The `count` variable holds the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the last test case. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries contain the key-value pairs for the last test case. The `num` variable holds the last integer in the last test case, and the `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` variables hold the corresponding values for the last integer in the last test case.
