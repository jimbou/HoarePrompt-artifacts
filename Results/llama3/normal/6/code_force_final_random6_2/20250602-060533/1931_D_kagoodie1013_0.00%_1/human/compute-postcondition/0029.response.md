In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The list of test cases, the number of integers in the third test case, the first integer in the third test case, and the second integer in the third test case remain unchanged.
* The list of integers in the third test case must have at least n integers.
* The results list contains the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively, plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively.
* The count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively.
* The mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries have a key mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively, with a value of n.
* The num variable is the last integer in the list arr.
* The mod_x and mod_y variables are the remainder of -num divided by x and num divided by y respectively.
* The mod_x_key and mod_y_key variables are the remainder of num divided by x and y respectively.
