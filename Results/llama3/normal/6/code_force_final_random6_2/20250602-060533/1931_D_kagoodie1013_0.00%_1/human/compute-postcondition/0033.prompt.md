You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.

        results.append(count)
        
    #State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least as many test cases as the length of test_cases, n is the number of integers in the last test case, x is the first integer in the last test case, y is the second integer in the last test case, arr is the list of integers in the last test case that must have at least n integers, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for each test case, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for the last test case, mod_x_map is a dictionary with the key mod_x_key and value n, mod_y_map is a dictionary with the key mod_y_key and value n, num is the last integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of results containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for each test case. The values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map are determined by the number of integers in the last test case (n), the first integer in the last test case (x), and the second integer in the last test case (y). The keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key are determined by the remainder of the last integer in the list arr divided by x and y respectively. The values of mod_x and mod_y are determined by the remainder of -num divided by x and num divided by y respectively.

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of results containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for each test case. The values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map are determined by the number of integers in the last test case (n), the first integer in the last test case (x), and the second integer in the last test case (y). The keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key are determined by the remainder of the last integer in the list arr divided by x and y respectively. The values of mod_x and mod_y are determined by the remainder of -num divided by x and num divided by y respectively.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
