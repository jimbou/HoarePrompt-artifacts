Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has created a new empty list called `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The `results` list is empty, waiting to be populated with results from the test cases.
