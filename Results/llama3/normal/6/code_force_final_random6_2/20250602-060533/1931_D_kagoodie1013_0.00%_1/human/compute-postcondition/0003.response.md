To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. 

State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x is the first integer in the first test case, y is the second integer in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case that must have at least 1 integer, results is an empty list, count is 0, mod_x_map is an empty dictionary, mod_y_map is an empty dictionary, num is the first integer in the list arr**
