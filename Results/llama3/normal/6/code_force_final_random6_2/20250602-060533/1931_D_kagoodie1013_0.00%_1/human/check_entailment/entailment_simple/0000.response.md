Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way the program counts the beautiful pairs. The program increments the count by the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, and then increments the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively. However, this approach is incorrect because it counts the pairs multiple times.

For example, consider the test case where n = 6, x = 5, y = 2, and arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]. The program will count the pair (1, 9) twice, once when it encounters the number 1 and again when it encounters the number 9. This is because the program increments the count by the value of mod_x_map for the key mod_x, which is 1, and then increments the value of mod_x_map for the key mod_x_key, which is also 1.

To fix this issue, the program should only increment the count by the value of mod_x_map for the key mod_x, and not by the value of mod_y_map for the key mod_y. This is because the pair (i, j) is beautiful if and only if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y. Therefore, the program should only count the pairs where a_i + a_j is divisible by x, and not the pairs where a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Correctness: **False**
