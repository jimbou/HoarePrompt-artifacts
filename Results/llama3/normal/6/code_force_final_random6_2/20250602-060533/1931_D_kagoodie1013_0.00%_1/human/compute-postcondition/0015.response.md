The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least n+1 integers the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least n integers, num is the first integer in the list arr, n is the number of integers in the second test case, x is the first integer in the second test case, y is the second integer in the second test case, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with the key mod_x_key and value 1, mod_y_map is a dictionary with the key mod_y_key and value 1, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least n+1 integers and the num is the next integer in the list arr.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n is the number of integers in the second test case, x is the first integer in the second test case, y is the second integer in the second test case, arr is the list of integers in the second test case that must have at least n+1 integers, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with the key mod_x_key and value 1, mod_y_map is a dictionary with the key mod_y_key and value 1, num is the next integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y**
