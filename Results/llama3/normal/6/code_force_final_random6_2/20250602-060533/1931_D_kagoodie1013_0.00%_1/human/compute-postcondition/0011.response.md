The only variables in the loop head are variables  n, x, y, arr and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 2 test cases the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x is the first integer in the first test case, y is the second integer in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case that must have at least n integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 test cases and n is the number of integers in the second test case, x is the first integer in the second test case, y is the second integer in the second test case, arr is the list of integers in the second test case that must have at least n integers.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n is the number of integers in the second test case, x is the first integer in the second test case, y is the second integer in the second test case, arr is the list of integers in the second test case that must have at least n integers, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key and a value of n, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key and a value of n, num is the nth integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y**
