    return results
    #The program returns a list of results containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively for each test case. The values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map are determined by the number of integers in the last test case (n), the first integer in the last test case (x), and the second integer in the last test case (y). The keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key are determined by the remainder of the last integer in the list arr divided by x and y respectively. The values of mod_x and mod_y are determined by the remainder of -num divided by x and num divided by y respectively.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the occurrences of these remainders. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the total number of pairs of integers in the corresponding test case that have the same remainder modulo x or y.
