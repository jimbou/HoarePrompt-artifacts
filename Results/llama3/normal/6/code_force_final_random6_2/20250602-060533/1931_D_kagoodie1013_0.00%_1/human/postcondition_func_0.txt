This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the occurrences of these remainders. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the total number of pairs of integers in the corresponding test case that have the same remainder modulo x or y.
