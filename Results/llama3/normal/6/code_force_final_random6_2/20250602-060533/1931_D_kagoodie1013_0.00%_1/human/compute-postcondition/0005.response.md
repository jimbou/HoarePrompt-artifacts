To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the number of integers in the first test case, `x` is the first integer in the first test case, `y` is the second integer in the first test case, `arr` is the list of integers in the first test case that must have at least 2 integers, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and a value of 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and a value of 1, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x_key` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y_key` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`**
