Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it counts the beautiful pairs. The program increments the count by the sum of the occurrences of the modulo x and modulo y of the current number, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to increment the count by the number of occurrences of the modulo x and modulo y that would make a beautiful pair with the current number.

For example, consider the input:

n = 6, x = 5, y = 2
arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]

The program would incorrectly count the pair (1, 2) as a beautiful pair, because it increments the count by the sum of the occurrences of the modulo x and modulo y of the number 1, which is 1. However, the pair (1, 2) is not a beautiful pair because 1 + 2 is not divisible by 5 and 1 - 2 is not divisible by 2.

A correct implementation would use two separate maps to count the occurrences of the modulo x and modulo y of each number, and then iterate over the array again to count the beautiful pairs. For each number, it would increment the count by the number of occurrences of the modulo x and modulo y that would make a beautiful pair with the current number.
