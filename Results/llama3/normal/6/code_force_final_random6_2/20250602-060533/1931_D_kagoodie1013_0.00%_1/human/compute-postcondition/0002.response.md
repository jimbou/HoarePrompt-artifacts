Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x is the first integer in the first test case, y is the second integer in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case, results is an empty list, count is 0, mod_x_map is an empty dictionary, mod_y_map is an empty dictionary**

The code initializes three new variables: `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map`. The `count` variable is set to 0, and the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` variables are initialized as empty dictionaries. The existing variables `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged.
