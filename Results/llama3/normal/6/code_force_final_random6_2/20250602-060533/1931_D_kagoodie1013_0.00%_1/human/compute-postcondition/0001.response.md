To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is the number of integers in the first test case, `x` is the first integer in the first test case, `y` is the second integer in the first test case, `arr` is the list of integers in the first test case, `results` is an empty list**
