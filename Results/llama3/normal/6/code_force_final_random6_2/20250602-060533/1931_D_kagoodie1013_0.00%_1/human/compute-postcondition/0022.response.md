Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n is the number of integers in the third test case, x is the first integer in the third test case, y is the second integer in the third test case, arr is the list of integers in the third test case that must have at least n integers, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, count is 0, mod_x_map is an empty dictionary, mod_y_map is an empty dictionary, num is the last integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y**

The code initializes `count` to 0, and creates empty dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
