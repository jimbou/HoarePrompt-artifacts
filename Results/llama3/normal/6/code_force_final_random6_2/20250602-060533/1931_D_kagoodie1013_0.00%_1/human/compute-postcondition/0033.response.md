Functionality: This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the occurrences of these remainders. The function returns a list of results, where each result is the total count of occurrences of the calculated remainders for each test case.
