Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x is the first integer in the first test case, y is the second integer in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case that must have at least n integers, results is a list containing the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key and a value of n, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key and a value of n, num is the nth integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y**

In natural language, the output state is that the results list now contains the count value, which is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
