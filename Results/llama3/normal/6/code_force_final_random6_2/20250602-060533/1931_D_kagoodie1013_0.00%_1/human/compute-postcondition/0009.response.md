Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is the number of integers in the first test case, x is the first integer in the first test case, y is the second integer in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case that must have at least n integers, results is an empty list, count is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key and a value of n, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key and a value of n, num is the nth integer in the list arr, mod_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, mod_x_key is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y_key is the remainder of num divided by y**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the integers in the first test case. The count variable now holds the total count of pairs of integers that satisfy the given conditions. The mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries now contain the frequency of each remainder when the integers in the first test case are divided by x and y respectively. The num variable now holds the last integer in the first test case, and the mod_x, mod_y, mod_x_key, and mod_y_key variables hold the corresponding remainders for this integer.
