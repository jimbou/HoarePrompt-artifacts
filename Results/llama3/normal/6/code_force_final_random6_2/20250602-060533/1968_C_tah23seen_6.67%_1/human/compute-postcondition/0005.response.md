Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `ans[i + 1]` is not less than the current value of `arr[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `ans[1]` has been updated by adding `ans[0]` to it, resulting in `ans[1]` being equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
