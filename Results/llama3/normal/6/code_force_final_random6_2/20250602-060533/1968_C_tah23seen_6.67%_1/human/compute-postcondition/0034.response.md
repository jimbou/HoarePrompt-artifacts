Output State: **The program returns a list of `n` integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the element at index `i + 1` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and if this value is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then it is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`. The last element is updated to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
