Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`, `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` is greater than or equal to `ans[n]`, `i` is less than `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` is less than or equal to `arr[n-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `ans[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the values of `arr` and `ans` are still valid, and the relationship between `ans[i + 1]` and `ans[i]` has been updated to reflect the new calculation.
