Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`, and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` is greater than or equal to `ans[n]`, `i` is `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is equal to `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged with `n-1` integers, and the integer `n` is still between 4 and 500. The list `ans` has been updated such that its last element `ans[n-1]` is now equal to the sum of `arr[n-2]` and `ans[n-2]`. All other elements in `ans` remain the same as before. The conditions regarding the relationships between `arr` and `ans` elements are still valid.
