Output State: **ans[i + 1] is equal to arr[i] + ans[i] + ans[i] + ... + ans[i] (i times), and i is equal to n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `i` times the value of `ans[i]`, and the loop has iterated `n-1` times. This means that the loop has updated the values of `ans` array based on the values of `arr` array and the previous values of `ans` array, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to `n-1`.
