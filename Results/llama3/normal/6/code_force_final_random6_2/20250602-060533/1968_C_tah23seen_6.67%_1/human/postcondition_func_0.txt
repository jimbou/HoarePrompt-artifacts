This function generates a list of n integers based on the input list arr of n-1 integers. It initializes the first element of the output list as arr[0] + 1 and the second element as 2 * arr[0] + 1. For each subsequent element, it calculates the value as the sum of the corresponding element in arr and the previous element in the output list. If this calculated value is less than the corresponding element in arr, it updates the value to arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]. Finally, it updates the last element to the sum of the second last element in the output list and the last element in arr. The function returns this generated list of n integers.
