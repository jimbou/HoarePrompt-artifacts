Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers where `arr[i + 1]` is greater than its current value, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, `ans[3]` is equal to `4 * arr[0] + 3`, `ans[4]` is equal to `5 * arr[0] + 4`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0**.

In this output state, the value of `ans[4]` has been updated to `5 * arr[0] + 4` because `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]`, and `i` is 0. The values of the other variables remain the same.
