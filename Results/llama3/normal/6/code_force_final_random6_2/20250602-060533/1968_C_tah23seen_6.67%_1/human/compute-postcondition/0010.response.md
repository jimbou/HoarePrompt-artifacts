Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, ..., `ans[n-1]` is equal to `n * arr[0] + (n-1)`, and `i` is `n-2`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ans[j]` is equal to `(j+1) * arr[0] + j` for `0 <= j <= n-1`, and `i` is `n-2`. The loop continues to execute until `ans[i + 1]` is not less than `arr[i + 1]`, at which point `i` is `n-2` and the loop terminates.
