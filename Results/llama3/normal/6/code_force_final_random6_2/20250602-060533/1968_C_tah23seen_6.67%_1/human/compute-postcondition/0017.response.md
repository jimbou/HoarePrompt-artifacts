Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i - 1]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`, `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[n]`, and `ans[i + 1]` is increased by `ans[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, and the list `ans` still has the same properties as before, but the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been increased by the value of `ans[i]`. All other conditions and properties of the variables remain the same.
