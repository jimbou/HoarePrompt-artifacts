Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 5

The program will output:

2 7 5

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. Specifically, 5 mod 2 is not equal to 1.

The issue with the program is in the function func_1. The line ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i] does not guarantee that ans[i + 1] will be greater than arr[i + 1], which is a requirement for the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} to hold. The subsequent while loop tries to increment ans[i + 1] until it is greater than arr[i + 1], but this is not sufficient to ensure that the condition is met.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
