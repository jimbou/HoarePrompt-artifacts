The variables in the loop head are `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, but `i` is `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is updated to `ans[n-1] + ans[n-2]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be less than `n-2`, so that `i + 1` is not equal to `n-1` and the update operation on `ans[n-1]` does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`, `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` is greater than or equal to `ans[n]`, `i` is less than `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` is less than or equal to `arr[n-1]`.**
