Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`, and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` is greater than or equal to `ans[n]`, `i` is `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is less than or equal to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans[n-1]` is updated to `ans[n-1] + ans[n-2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the value of `ans[n-1]` updated to be the sum of its previous value and `ans[n-2]`.
