To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, and `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0**
