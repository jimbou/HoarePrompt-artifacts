The value of `ans[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `arr[i] + ans[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `arr[0] + ans[0]`. The value of `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, so `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, which is `2 * arr[0] + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0**
