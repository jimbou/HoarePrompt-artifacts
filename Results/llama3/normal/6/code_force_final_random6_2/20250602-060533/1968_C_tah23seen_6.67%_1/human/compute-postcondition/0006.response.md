The variables in the loop head are `ans` and `arr`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `arr`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is not less than `arr[i + 1]`, so for the loop to be executed one more time `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to the current value of `arr[i + 1]`.**
