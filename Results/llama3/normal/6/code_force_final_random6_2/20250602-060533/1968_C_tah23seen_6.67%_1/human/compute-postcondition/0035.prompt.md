You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and all elements in arr are integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500.
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of `n` integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the element at index `i + 1` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and if this value is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then it is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`. The last element is updated to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of `n` integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the element at index `i + 1` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and if this value is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then it is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`. The last element is updated to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
