Output State: **ans[i + 1] is equal to arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i], and i is either 1 or n-1, and arr[2] is greater than or equal to ans[2], and arr[n] is greater than or equal to ans[n].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` plus `(i + 1)` times `ans[i]`, where `i` is either 1 or `n-1`. Additionally, `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` is greater than or equal to `ans[n]`. This means that the loop has iterated until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and the values of `ans[i + 1]` have been updated accordingly.
