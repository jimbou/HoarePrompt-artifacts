The only variables in the loop head are `ans` and `arr`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `arr`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `arr` so that `arr[i + 1]` is greater than `ans[i + 1]`. Since `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, we can adjust `arr` so that `arr[i + 1]` is greater than its current value.

State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers where `arr[i + 1]` is greater than its current value, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, `ans[3]` is equal to `4 * arr[0] + 3`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0**
