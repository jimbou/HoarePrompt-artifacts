The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-3`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n-2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`.
State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`, and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, and `arr[n]` is greater than or equal to `ans[n]`, `i` is `n-2`**
