Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, `ans[3]` is equal to `4 * arr[0] + 3`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `ans[i + 1]` is equal to the current value of `arr[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `ans[1]` has been updated. The value of `ans[1]` was initially `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and now it has been increased by `ans[0]`, which is `arr[0] + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1 + arr[0] + 1 = 3 * arr[0] + 2`. This value is equal to the current value of `arr[1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
