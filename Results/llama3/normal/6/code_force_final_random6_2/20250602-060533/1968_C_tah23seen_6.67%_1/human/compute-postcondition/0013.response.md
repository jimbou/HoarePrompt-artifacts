Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is either 1 or `n-1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `n` is still between 3 and 500, and the list `ans` has been updated such that the element at index `i + 1` is now equal to the sum of the element at index `i` in `arr` and the element at index `i` in `ans`. The value of `i` is still either 1 or `n-1`.
