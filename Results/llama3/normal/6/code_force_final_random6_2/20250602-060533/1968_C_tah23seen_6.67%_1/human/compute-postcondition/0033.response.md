Output State: **The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1] + (i + 1) * ans[i]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is updated to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is a list of `n` integers where the first two elements are calculated based on the first element of the input array `arr`, and the remaining elements are calculated based on the previous elements in the output list `ans` and the corresponding elements in the input array `arr`. The last element of the output list is updated to be the sum of the second last element of the output list and the last element of the input array.
