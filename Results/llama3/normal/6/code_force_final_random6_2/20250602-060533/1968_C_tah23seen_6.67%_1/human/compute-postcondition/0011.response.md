Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are either 0 or calculated as `k * arr[0] + (k-1)` where `k` is the index of the element in `ans` and `k` is larger than 1, and `i` is either 0 or `n-2`***
