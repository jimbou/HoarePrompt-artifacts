Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw which is False if the current value of nums[i] is 1, otherwise True.**

In this output state, the value of nw has been updated to be equal to cw. The value of cw depends on the current value of nums[i]. If nums[i] is 1, then cw is False, and therefore nw is also False. Otherwise, cw is True, and nw is also True. The other variables remain unchanged.
