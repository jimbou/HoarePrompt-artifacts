Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on a list of integers. The function reads a positive integer N and a list of N space-separated integers from standard input, sorts the list, and then iterates through the list in reverse order to determine the winner. The winner is either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the values in the list. The function prints the winner to the console.**
