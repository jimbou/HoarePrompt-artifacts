Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. nw is equal to cw which is True if the current value of nums[i] is 1, otherwise False. nw is now equal to not cw.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cw` has been updated to the opposite of its previous value, which is now equal to `nw`. This means that if `cw` was True (i.e., `nums[i]` is 1), it is now False, and if it was False (i.e., `nums[i]` is not 1), it is now True.
