Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. nw is equal to True, cw is True.**

The code sets the value of `cw` to `True`, which in turn sets the value of `nw` to `True` since `nw` is equal to `cw`. The other variables remain unchanged.
