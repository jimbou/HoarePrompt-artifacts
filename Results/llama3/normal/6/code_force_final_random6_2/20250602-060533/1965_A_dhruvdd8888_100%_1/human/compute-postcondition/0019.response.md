Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases. nw is equal to cw which is True if the current value of nums[i] is 1, otherwise False. If nums[i] is not 1, then cw is the opposite of nw.***
