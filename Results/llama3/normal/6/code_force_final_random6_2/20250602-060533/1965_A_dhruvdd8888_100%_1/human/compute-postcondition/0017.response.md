Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw which is True if the current value of nums[i] is 1, otherwise False, cw is the opposite of nw.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of N, nums, ls, i, and stdin remains the same as in the initial state. The value of nw and cw is updated based on the current value of nums[i]. If nums[i] is 1, then nw and cw are True, otherwise, they are False. Additionally, cw is the opposite of nw.
