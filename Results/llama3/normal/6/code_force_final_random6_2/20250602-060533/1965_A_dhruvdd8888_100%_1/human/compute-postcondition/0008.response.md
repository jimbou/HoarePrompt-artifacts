Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least N+1 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is N, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is True, cw is True.**

The provided code snippet does not modify any of the initial state variables (N, nums, ls, i, stdin). It only introduces two new boolean variables, nw and cw, and assigns them the value True. The initial state remains unchanged, with the addition of these two new variables.
