Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 2 elements, ls is equal to the sum of the second and third elements of the original list, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of N remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list nums is still a sorted list of N+1 positive integers, including 0, and all elements are less than or equal to 10^9. The list must have at least 2 elements. The variable ls now holds the sum of the second and third elements of the original list. The variable i remains unchanged at 1. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
