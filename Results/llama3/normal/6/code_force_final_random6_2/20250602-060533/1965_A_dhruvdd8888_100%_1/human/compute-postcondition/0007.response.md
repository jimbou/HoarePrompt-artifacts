Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least N+1 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is N, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except that the variable `ls` will be equal to the sum of all elements in the original list `nums`, and the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, which is the number of elements in `nums` minus 1. The list `nums` will still be sorted and contain `N+1` positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9. The variable `stdin` will still contain `t-1` test cases.
