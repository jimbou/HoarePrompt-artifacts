The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and list  nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is len(nums) - 3, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time the i is len(nums) - 4 and nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements.
State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. nw is equal to cw which is True if the current value of nums[i] is 1, otherwise False. nw is now equal to cw.**
