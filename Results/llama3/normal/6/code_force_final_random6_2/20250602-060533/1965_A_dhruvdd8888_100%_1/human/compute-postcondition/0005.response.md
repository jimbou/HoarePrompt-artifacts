To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(nums)):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`. Since `i` is 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2. Additionally, `nums` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of the second and third elements of the original list, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
