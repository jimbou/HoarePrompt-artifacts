To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):`

The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 (since the step is -1).

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw which is False if the current value of nums[i] is 1, otherwise True.**

Note that the states of `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `stdin`, `nw`, and `cw` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head. Only the state of `i` is adjusted.
