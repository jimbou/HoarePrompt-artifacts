Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw which is True.**

In this output state, the value of cw is changed to True, regardless of the previous value of nums[i]. The values of the other variables remain the same.
