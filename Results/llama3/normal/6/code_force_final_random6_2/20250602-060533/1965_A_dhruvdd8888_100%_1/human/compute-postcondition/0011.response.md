Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 3 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is len(nums) - 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is True, cw is False. The current value of nums[i] is 1.**

The code `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the opposite of `nw`. Since `nw` is True, `cw` becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
