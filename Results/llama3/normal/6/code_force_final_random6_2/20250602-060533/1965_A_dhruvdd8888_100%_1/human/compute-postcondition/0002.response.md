Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least 1 element, ls is equal to the first element of nums, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The first line subtracts the value of `ls` from the first element of `nums`. Since `ls` is 0, the first element of `nums` remains unchanged. The second line adds the value of the first element of `nums` to `ls`, making `ls` equal to the first element of `nums`. No other variables are affected.
