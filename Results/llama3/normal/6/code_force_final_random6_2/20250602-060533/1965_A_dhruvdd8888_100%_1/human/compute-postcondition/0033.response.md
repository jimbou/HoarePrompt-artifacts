Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of N+1 positive integers (including 0) less than or equal to 10^9 that must have at least N+1 elements, ls is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, nw is equal to cw. If nw is True, then 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Bob' is being printed.***
