Output: **t is 0, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is a positive integer equal to the number of i from 1 to k that are in a but not in b, n is a positive integer equal to the number of i from 1 to k that are not in a but in b, stdin contains no test cases, i is k, k is a positive integer, u is 1 if k is in a, otherwise 0, v is 1 if k is in b, otherwise 0, and this is printed: 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] which is 'Y' if f is 1 and m and n are both 0, 'N' if f is 0 or either m or n is greater than 0, 'E' if f is 1 and either m or n is greater than 0, 'O' if f is 0 and both m and n are 0, 'S' is not a possible output**
