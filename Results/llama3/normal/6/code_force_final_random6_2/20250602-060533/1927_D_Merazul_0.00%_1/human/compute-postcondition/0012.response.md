The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0, so for the loop to be executed one more time t must be not equal to 0.
State: **t is not 0, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is a positive integer equal to the number of i from 1 to k that are in a but not in b, n is a positive integer equal to the number of i from 1 to k that are not in a but in b, stdin contains no test cases, i is k, k is a positive integer, u is 1 if k is in a, otherwise 0, v is 1 if k is in b, otherwise 0, and this is printed: 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]**
