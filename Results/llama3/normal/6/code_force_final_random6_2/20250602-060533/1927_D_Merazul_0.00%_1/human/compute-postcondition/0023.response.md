The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of t needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1 and t currently must be greater than 0, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, n is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2, k is a positive integer, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, i is k, stdin contains no test cases, and this is printed: 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]**
