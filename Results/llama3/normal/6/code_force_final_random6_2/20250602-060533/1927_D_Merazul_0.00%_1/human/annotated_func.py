#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer representing the length of the list of integers. The list of integers contains positive integers. The second integer is a positive integer representing the length of the list of pairs of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of positive integers such that the first integer in each pair is less than the second integer.
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        *_, k = R()
        
        a = {*R()}
        
        b = {*R()}
        
        f = 1
        
        m = n = k // 2
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
        
    #State: t is 0, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 0, m is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of positive integers less than or equal to k that are in a and not in b, n is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of positive integers less than or equal to k that are not in a and are in b, k is a positive integer, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, i is k, stdin contains no test cases, and the string 'N' is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: an integer representing the length of a list of integers, the list of integers, an integer representing the length of a list of pairs of integers, and the list of pairs of integers. It then checks if the union of the list of integers and the list of pairs of integers contains all positive integers up to the length of the list of integers. If the union contains all positive integers, it prints 'Y', otherwise it prints 'N'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
