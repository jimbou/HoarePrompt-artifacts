The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k. If i is less than k + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, k is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again k must be at least 3.
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 1 if i is in a or b, otherwise 0, m is a positive integer equal to half of k minus 1 if i is in a but not in b, otherwise equal to half of k, n is a positive integer equal to half of k minus 1 if i is not in a but in b, otherwise equal to half of k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, k is at least 3**
