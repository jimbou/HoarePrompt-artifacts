Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains positive integers. The integer is a positive integer representing the length of the list of pairs of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of positive integers such that the first integer in each pair is less than the second integer. t is a positive integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. It then reads the first integer from stdin using this function and assigns it to `t`. The value of `t` is a positive integer. The remaining inputs in stdin are unchanged.
