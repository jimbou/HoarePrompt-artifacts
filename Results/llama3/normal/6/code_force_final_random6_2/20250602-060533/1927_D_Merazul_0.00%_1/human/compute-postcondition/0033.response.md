To calculate the postcondition, let's analyze the given print statement and the initial state.

The print statement is:
```
print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```
Here, `f` is 0, so `f ^ 1` is 1. The expression `m | n < 0` is a bitwise OR operation between `m` and `n`, and then a comparison with 0. Since `m` and `n` are positive integers, the result of `m | n` will always be non-zero, making the comparison `m | n < 0` always False.

The slicing `::2` means starting from the beginning of the string, take every 2nd character.

Now, let's evaluate the expression inside the square brackets:
```
'YNEOS'[1 or False::2]
```
Since `1 or False` is 1, we take the character at index 1 from the string 'YNEOS', which is 'N'.

So, the print statement will output the string 'N'.

Now, let's add this to the initial state to form the postcondition:

Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 0, m is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of positive integers less than or equal to k that are in a and not in b, n is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of positive integers less than or equal to k that are not in a and are in b, k is a positive integer, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, i is k, stdin contains no test cases, and the string 'N' is being printed**
