The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k. If i is less than k + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, k is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1 and k must be at least 3.
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 0, m is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus 1 if 1 is in a and 1 is not in b, otherwise m is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus 1, n is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus 1 if 1 is not in a and 1 is in b, otherwise n is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus 1, k must be at least 3, u is False, v is False, i is 3, stdin contains no test cases**
