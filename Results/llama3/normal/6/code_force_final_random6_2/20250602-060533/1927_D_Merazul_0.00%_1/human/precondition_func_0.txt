stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer representing the length of the list of integers. The list of integers contains positive integers. The second integer is a positive integer representing the length of the list of pairs of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of positive integers such that the first integer in each pair is less than the second integer.
