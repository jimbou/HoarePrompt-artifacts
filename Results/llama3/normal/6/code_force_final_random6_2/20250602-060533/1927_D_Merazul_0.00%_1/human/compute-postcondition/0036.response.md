Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: an integer representing the length of a list of integers, the list of integers, an integer representing the length of a list of pairs of integers, and the list of pairs of integers. It then checks if the union of the list of integers and the list of pairs of integers contains all positive integers up to the length of the list of integers. If the union contains all positive integers, it prints 'Y', otherwise it prints 'N'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
