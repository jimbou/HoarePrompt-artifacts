Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a set of positive integers, b is a set of pairs of positive integers, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise k // 2, n is a positive integer equal to k // 2 minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in b and not in a, otherwise k // 2, k is a positive integer, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, i is k, stdin contains no test cases, and this is printed: 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]**
