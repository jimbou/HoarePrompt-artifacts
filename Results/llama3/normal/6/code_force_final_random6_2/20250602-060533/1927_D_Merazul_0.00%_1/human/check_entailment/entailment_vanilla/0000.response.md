Reasoning:

The given Python program is attempting to solve the problem described, but it does not correctly implement the required logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the input and processes it. However, the function does not correctly handle the input data.

2. The program reads the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the array elements `a`, and the number of queries `q`. However, it does not correctly process the queries.

3. The program uses a set `a` to store the array elements, which is not necessary for this problem. It also uses a set `b` to store the query boundaries, which is not used correctly.

4. The program uses a variable `f` to track whether a pair of different elements exists for each query. However, it does not correctly update this variable based on the query boundaries.

5. The program uses variables `m` and `n` to track the number of elements in the first and second halves of the array, respectively. However, it does not correctly update these variables based on the query boundaries.

6. The program prints the result for each query using the expression `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`. However, this expression does not correctly represent the required output format.

7. The program does not correctly handle the case where a pair of different elements does not exist for a query. It should print `-1 -1` in this case, but the program does not do so.

Based on these issues, it is clear that the given Python program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
