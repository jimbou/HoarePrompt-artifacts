Output State: **k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to the original value of k.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of k will be 0, the value of i will be equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, the list arr will contain the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, and the list ans will contain the elements that were being printed during the loop's execution. The values of n and k0 remain unchanged.
