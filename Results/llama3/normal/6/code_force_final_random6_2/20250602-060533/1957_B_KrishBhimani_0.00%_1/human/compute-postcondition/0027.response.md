Output State: **n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is the next element in arr, c is either equal to n or less than n but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and the third element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first two elements, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even), and has at least two more elements.**

The code appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first two elements of `ans`. This new element is the third element in the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
