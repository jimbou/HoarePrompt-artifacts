Output State: **`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` is equal to `k0` divided by 2, `k0` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2 and `k0` is not equal to 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `arr` now depends on whether `k0` is an odd number or not. If `k0` is odd, `arr` contains two elements: 0 and 1. If `k0` is even, `arr` contains a single element: 1.
