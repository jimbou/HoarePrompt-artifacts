Output: ** `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `c` is equal to the original value of `c` plus the number of elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing elements equal to 1 shifted left by the values of `i` for each element in `arr`, and `ans` has been padded with zeros to a length of `n`. If `c` is equal to `n`, then `ans` also contains the new element `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are being printed**
