To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arr` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` has at least 1 index of the bits in the binary representation of `k0` that are equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more index.

Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the next element in `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `arr`.

The other variables `k`, `c`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 indices of the bits in the binary representation of `k0` that are equal to 1, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0` if `c` was equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` contains a single element equal to `k0` and a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`.**
