Postcondition: ***t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is either 0 (if k0 is odd) or 1 (if k0 is even), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0, if c is equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing one element equal to k0 - sum(ans), otherwise ans is an empty list, c is either equal to n - 1 or less than n - 1, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even).***
