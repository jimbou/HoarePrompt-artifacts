Output State: **`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` is equal to `k0` divided by 4, `k0` is equal to `k` multiplied by 4 and `k0` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 2. If `k0` is an even number, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `arr` now depends on whether `k0` is odd or even. If `k0` is odd, `arr` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2. If `k0` is even, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 2.
