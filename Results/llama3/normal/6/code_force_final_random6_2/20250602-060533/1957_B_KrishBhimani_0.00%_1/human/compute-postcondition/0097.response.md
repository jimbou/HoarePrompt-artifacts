Output State: **k is 0, i is the third element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 3 elements, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 3, ans is a list containing the original elements of ans plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of i. If c is equal to n, then ans also contains the new element k0 - sum(ans).**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1 from its original value plus 2, making it equal to the original value of `c` plus 3. The list `ans` now contains the original elements plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of `i`. Additionally, if `c` is equal to `n`, then `ans` also contains the new element `k0 - sum(ans)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
