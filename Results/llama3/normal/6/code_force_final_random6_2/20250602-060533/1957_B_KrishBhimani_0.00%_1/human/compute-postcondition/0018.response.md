Postcondition: ***`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 (if `k0` is odd) or 1 (if `k0` is even), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list containing either `k0` elements (if `k0` is odd) or `k0-1` elements (if `k0` is even).***
