Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: the first `n-1` elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the `n`th element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements, `_` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of `ans` are printed as separate values

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is equal to `n + len(arr) - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, and `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `c` is equal to the original value of `c` plus the number of elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing elements equal to 1 shifted left by the values of `i` for each element in `arr`, and `ans` has been padded with zeros to a length of `n`. If `c` is equal to `n`, then `ans` also contains the new element `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the elements of `ans` are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
