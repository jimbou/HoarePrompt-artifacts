Postcondition: ***k is 0, i is the next element in arr, arr is a list containing at least 2 indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0 if c was equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans contains a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, and a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans).***
