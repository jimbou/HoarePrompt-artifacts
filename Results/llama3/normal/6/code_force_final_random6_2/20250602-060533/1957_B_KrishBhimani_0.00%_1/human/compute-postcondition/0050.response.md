Output State: **k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, ans is an empty list, c is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `ans` and `c`, but does not modify the existing variables `k`, `i`, or `arr`. The variable `ans` is assigned an empty list, and `c` is assigned the value 0. The values of `k`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
