Output State: **n is an integer, k is not equal to 0 and is an odd number, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is 0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, arr is a list containing one element: 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
