Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is 0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, arr is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer equal to k0 shifted right by 1, k0 is an integer equal to k0, i is 1, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is an odd number, arr is a list containing one element: 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer, k is an integer equal to k0 shifted right by 2 and k is not zero, k0 is an integer equal to k0, i is 2, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is an odd number, arr is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one element: 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer, k is an integer equal to k0 shifted right by 3 and k is not zero, k0 is an integer equal to k0, i is 3, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is an odd number, arr is a list containing three elements: 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, arr is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
