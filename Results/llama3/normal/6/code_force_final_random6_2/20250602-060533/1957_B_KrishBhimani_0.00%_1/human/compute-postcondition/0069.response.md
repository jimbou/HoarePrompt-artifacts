Output State: **k is the value of the second integer in the input, i is 0, arr is an empty list, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, and n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to k.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to the second integer in the input, and `i` has been reset to 0. The list `arr` remains empty. The value of `c` is still equal to `n + len(arr) - 1`, but now `n` is the value of the first integer in the input. The list `ans` has been updated to contain a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`. The list `ans` has also been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros. The elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once. The value of `k0` is equal to `k`.
