Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is either equal to `n - 1` or less than `n - 1` but greater than its original value, `ans` is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `arr` is a list containing either `k0` elements (if `k0` is odd) or `k0-1` elements (if `k0` is even), and has at least one more element. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, and the second element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first element, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and `arr` is a list containing either `k0` elements (if `k0` is odd) or `k0-1` elements (if `k0` is even), and has at least one more element.***
