Output State: **t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is equal to k0 divided by 8, k0 is equal to k multiplied by 8 and k0 is greater than 4, i is 3, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 2. If k0 is an even number, arr is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been modified by the code, specifically by the line `k = k >> 1`, which performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. Since `k` was initially equal to `k0` divided by 4, the new value of `k` is equal to `k0` divided by 8. The value of `k0` remains the same, as it is not directly modified by the code. The value of `i` has also been modified by the code, specifically by the line `i += 1`, which increments `i` by 1, making it equal to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
