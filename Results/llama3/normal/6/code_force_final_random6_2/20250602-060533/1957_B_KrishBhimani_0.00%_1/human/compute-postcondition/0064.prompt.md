Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, ans is an empty list, c is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is 0, i is 0, arr is a list containing at least 1 index of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0 if c was equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans contains a single element equal to k0 and a second element equal to 1 shifted left by i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is 0, i is the next element in arr, arr is a list containing at least 2 indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n + 1, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0 if c was equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans contains a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, and a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and a new element equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is 0, i is the next element in arr, arr is a list containing at least 3 indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n + 2, ans contains a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), a new element equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and an additional element equal to k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
