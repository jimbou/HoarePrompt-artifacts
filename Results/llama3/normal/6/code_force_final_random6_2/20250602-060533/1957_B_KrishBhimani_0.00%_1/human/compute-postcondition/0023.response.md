Output State: **n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is the next element in arr, c is either equal to n - 1 or less than n - 1 but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, and the second element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first element, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even), and has at least one more element**

The code appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the existing elements in `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains one element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, the new element is equal to `k0` minus this value. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
