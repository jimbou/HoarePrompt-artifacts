Output State: **k is 0, i is the last element in arr, arr is an empty list, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable k remains 0, the variable i is the last element in the list arr, the list arr is empty, the variable c is equal to n plus the length of the original list arr minus 1, and the list ans contains a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1.
