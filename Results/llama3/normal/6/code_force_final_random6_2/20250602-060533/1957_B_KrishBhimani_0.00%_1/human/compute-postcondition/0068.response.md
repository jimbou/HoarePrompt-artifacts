State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is equal to `n + len(arr) - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, and `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once**
