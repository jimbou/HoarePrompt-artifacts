Output State: **n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is the next element in arr, c is either equal to n or less than n but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, and the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even), and has at least one more element.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and a new element has been appended to the `ans` list. The new element is equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` and `arr` is also updated to reflect the consumption of one line from `stdin` and the advancement of the iterator `i` in `arr`.
