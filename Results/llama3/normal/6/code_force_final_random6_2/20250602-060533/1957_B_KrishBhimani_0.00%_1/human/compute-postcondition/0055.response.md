Output State: **k is 0, i is 0, arr is a list containing at least 1 index of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0 if c was equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans contains a single element equal to k0 and a second element equal to 1 shifted left by i.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1, making it equal to `n`. Then, it appends a new element to the `ans` list, which is the result of shifting 1 to the left by the value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, this shift operation does not change the value, so the new element appended to `ans` is simply 1. The values of `k` and `arr` remain unchanged.
