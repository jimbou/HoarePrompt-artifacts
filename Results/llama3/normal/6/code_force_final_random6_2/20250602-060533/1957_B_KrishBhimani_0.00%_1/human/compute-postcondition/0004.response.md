Output State: **`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` must be non-zero and is currently an odd number, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is 0, `arr` now contains a single element 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
