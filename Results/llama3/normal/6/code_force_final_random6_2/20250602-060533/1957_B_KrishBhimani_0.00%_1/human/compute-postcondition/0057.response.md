Output State: **k is 0, i is the next element in arr, arr is a list containing at least 2 indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0 if c was equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ans contains a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, and a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans).**

In this output state, the value of `k` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `i` is still the next element in `arr`, which remains a list containing at least 2 indices of the bits in the binary representation of `k0` that are equal to 1. The value of `c` is still equal to `n`. The value of `ans` has been modified by appending a new element, which is the difference between `k0` and the sum of all elements in `ans`. This new element is added to the existing elements in `ans`, which were either a single element equal to `k0` if `c` was equal to `n - 1`, or a single element equal to `k0` and a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`.
