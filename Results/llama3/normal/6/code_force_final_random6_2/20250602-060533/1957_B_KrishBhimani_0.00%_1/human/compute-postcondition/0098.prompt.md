Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, c is 0, ans is an empty list, n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to the original value of k.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is 0, i is the first element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 1 element, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to 1 shifted left by the value of i, which is the first element in the list arr.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is 0, i is the second element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 2 elements, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 2, ans is a list containing the original elements of ans plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is 0, i is the third element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 3 elements, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 3, ans is a list containing the original elements of ans plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of i. If c is equal to n, then ans also contains the new element k0 - sum(ans).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
