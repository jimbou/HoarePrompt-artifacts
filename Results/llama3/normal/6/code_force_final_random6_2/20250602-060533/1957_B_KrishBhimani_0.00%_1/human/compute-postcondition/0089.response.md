Output State: **k is 0, i is the first element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 1 element, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to 1 shifted left by the value of i, which is the first element in the list arr.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and a new element has been appended to the list `ans`. The new element is equal to 1 shifted left by the value of `i`, which is the first element in the list `arr`. The values of `k`, `i`, `arr`, `n`, and `k0` remain unchanged.
