To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, which is 0, `i` is also 0.

So, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0.

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing at least 1 index of the bits in the binary representation of `k0` that are equal to 1, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
