Postcondition: **k is 0, i is the second element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 2 elements, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 1, if c is equal to n - 1, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the value of i, and the second element is equal to k0 - the first element. Otherwise, ans is a list containing a single element equal to 1 shifted left by the value of i.**
