Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is equal to k0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0, ans is an empty list, c is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing k0 elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., k0-1. If k0 is an even number, arr is a list containing k0-1 elements: 1, 2, 3, ..., k0-1.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is either 0 (if k0 is odd) or 1 (if k0 is even), c is either equal to n - 1 or less than n - 1 but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is the next element in arr, c is either equal to n or less than n but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, and the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even), and has at least one more element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is the next element in arr, c is either equal to n or less than n but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing either two or three elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and if c is equal to n - 1, the third element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first two elements, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even), and has at least two more elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
