The code snippet reads an integer t from stdin, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. It then initializes an empty list arr, assigns the value of k to k0, and sets i to 0.

Output State: **t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is an integer, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0**
