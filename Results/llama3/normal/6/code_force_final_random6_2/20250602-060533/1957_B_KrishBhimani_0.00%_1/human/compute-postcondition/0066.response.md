The code prints the elements of the `ans` list. Since `k` is 0, the first element of `ans` is 0. The second element of `ans` is 1 shifted left by the value of `i`, which is the last element in the empty list `arr`. Since `arr` is empty, `i` is undefined, so the second element of `ans` is undefined. The third element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, where `k0` is 0 and `sum(ans)` is the sum of the first two elements of `ans`, which is 0 + undefined = undefined. Therefore, the third element of `ans` is also undefined. The additional elements of `ans` are either 1 shifted left by the current value of `i` or `k0 - sum(ans)`, depending on the value of `c`. Since `c` is equal to `n + len(arr) - 1` and `arr` is empty, `c` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, the additional elements of `ans` are `k0 - sum(ans)`, which is undefined. The `ans` list has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, so the remaining elements of `ans` are zeros.

Output: **0, undefined, undefined, ..., 0 (where the number of zeros is n - 3)**
