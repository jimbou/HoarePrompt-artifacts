Output State: **`k` is not zero and is an odd number, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing a single element equal to 0, `c` is equal to `n + len(arr) - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1, a third element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 and `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, and `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` remains an odd number not equal to zero, `i` is still 0, `arr` now contains a single element which is 0, `c` is updated to be `n + len(arr) - 1`, `ans` remains the same list with its elements being printed, the loop has executed at least once, `n` is still the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is still equal to `k`.
