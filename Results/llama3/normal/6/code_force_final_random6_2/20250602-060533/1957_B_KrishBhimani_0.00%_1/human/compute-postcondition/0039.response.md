Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is not equal to 0, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is 0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is an odd number, arr is a list containing one element: 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.***
