Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`. Otherwise, the state of `ans` is not changed.***
