Output State: **k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable k becomes 0, the variable i becomes equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, and the list arr contains all the indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
