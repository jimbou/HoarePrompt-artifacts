Output State: **n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is the last element in arr, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is an empty list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `c` will be equal to `n`, and the list `ans` will contain `n` elements. The first `n-1` elements of `ans` will be equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the nth element will be equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements. The list `arr` will be empty, and the values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `_` will remain unchanged. The contents of `stdin` will also remain unchanged.
