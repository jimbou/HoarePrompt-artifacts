Postcondition: ***k is 0, i is the third element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 3 elements, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 2, ans is a list containing the original elements of ans plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of i. If c is equal to n - 1, then ans also contains the new element k0 - sum(ans).***
