Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is an integer, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is equal to k0 divided by 2, k0 is equal to k multiplied by 2, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` is equal to `k0` divided by 4, `k0` is equal to `k` multiplied by 4 and `k0` is not equal to 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1. If `k0` is an even number, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is equal to k0 divided by 8, k0 is equal to k multiplied by 8 and k0 is greater than 4, i is 3, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 2. If k0 is an even number, arr is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
