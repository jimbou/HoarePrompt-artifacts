Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer equal to k0 shifted right by 2 and k is not zero, k0 is an integer equal to k0, i is 2, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is an odd number, arr is a list containing three elements: 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, arr is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.***
