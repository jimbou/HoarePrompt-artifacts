Output State: **t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is equal to k0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing k0 elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., k0-1. If k0 is an even number, arr is a list containing k0-1 elements: 1, 2, 3, ..., k0-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` has been read from the standard input and is no longer available in the standard input.
* The value of `n` is an integer.
* The value of `k` is 0.
* The value of `k0` is a positive integer.
* The value of `i` is equal to the value of `k0`.
* The standard input contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
* The value of `_` is 0.
* If `k0` is an odd number, the list `arr` contains `k0` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `k0-1`. If `k0` is an even number, the list `arr` contains `k0-1` elements: 1, 2, 3, ..., `k0-1`.
