Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `k0` shifted right by 2 and `k` is not zero, `k0` is an integer equal to `k0`, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: the first `n-1` elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the nth element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing three elements: 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `arr` now depends on whether `k` is an odd number or not. If `k` is odd, `arr` contains three elements: 0, 1, and 2. If `k` is even, `arr` contains two elements: 1 and 2.
