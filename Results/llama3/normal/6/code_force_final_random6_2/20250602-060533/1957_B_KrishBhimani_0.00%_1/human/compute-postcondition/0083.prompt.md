Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is the value of the second integer in the input, i is 0, arr is an empty list, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, and ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, and n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to k.
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is half its original value, i is 1, arr is a list, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to k. If k is an odd number, arr contains a single element equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: k is half its original value, i is 2, arr is a list containing a single element equal to 1 if k is an odd number, otherwise it is a list, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to k.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: k is greater than 0, k is equal to its original value shifted right by 1, i is 3, arr is a list containing a single element equal to 1 if k is an odd number, otherwise it is a list, and the value 2 has been appended to it if k is odd, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is greater than 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
