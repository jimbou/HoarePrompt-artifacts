Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 indices of the bits in the binary representation of `k0` that are equal to 1, `c` is equal to `n + 1`. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`. Otherwise, `ans` contains a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, a new element equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and an additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`.***
