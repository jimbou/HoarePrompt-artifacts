Output State: **k is 0, i is 0, arr is a list containing at least 1 index of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, and c is equal to n - 1.**

Explanation: The first line appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the `ans` list. Since `ans` is initially empty, `sum(ans)` is 0, and the value appended to `ans` is simply `k0`. The second line breaks out of the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, this line has no effect. The values of `k`, `i`, `arr`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
