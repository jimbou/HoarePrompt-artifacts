Output State: **k is 0, i is the next element in arr, arr is a list containing at least 3 indices of the bits in the binary representation of k0 that are equal to 1, c is equal to n + 2, ans contains a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), a new element equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and an additional element equal to k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `k` remains 0. The value of `i` moves to the next element in the list `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged, containing at least 3 indices of the bits in the binary representation of `k0` that are equal to 1. The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `n + 2`. The list `ans` is updated by appending a new element equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`. The other elements in `ans` remain unchanged, including the single element equal to `k0`, the second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, the third element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`.
