To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

Since `i` is equal to `k0`, we can adjust `i` to be the first element in `arr`. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` contains `k0` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `k0-1`, so `i` can be 0. If `k0` is an even number, `arr` contains `k0-1` elements: 1, 2, 3, ..., `k0-1`, so `i` can be 1.

State: **`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 (if `k0` is odd) or 1 (if `k0` is even), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either `k0` elements (if `k0` is odd) or `k0-1` elements (if `k0` is even)**
