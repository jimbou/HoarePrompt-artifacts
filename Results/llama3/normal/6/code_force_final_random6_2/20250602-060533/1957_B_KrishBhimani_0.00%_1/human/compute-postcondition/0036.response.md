The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, k is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to k is not equal to 0.

State: **n is an integer, k is not equal to 0, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is 0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, arr is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k**
