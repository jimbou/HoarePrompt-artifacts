Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is 0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, arr is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers n and k, and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. This means that the value of n is updated to the new value read from stdin, and k is also updated to the new value read from stdin. The variable k0 is assigned the value of k, so k0 is now equal to k. The variable i is assigned the value 0. The variable arr is assigned an empty list. The variable ans is not modified by this code snippet, so it remains a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements. The variable _ is not modified by this code snippet, so it remains 1. The variable c is not modified by this code snippet, so it remains equal to n. Stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
