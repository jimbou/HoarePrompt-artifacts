The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k.  If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is equal to k0 divided by 2, and k0 is equal to k multiplied by 2. This means k is equal to k0 divided by 2, and k0 is equal to (k0 divided by 2) multiplied by 2. So k0 is equal to k0, which means k0 is equal to itself. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so k0 needs to be adjusted to k0 is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is equal to k0 divided by 2, k0 is equal to k multiplied by 2 and k0 is not equal to 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.**
