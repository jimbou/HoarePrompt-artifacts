Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers n and k.

2. It then generates a list of n elements, where the first n-1 elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the binary representation of k. This is done by iterating over the binary representation of k from right to left (i.e., from the least significant bit to the most significant bit), and for each '1' bit, it appends the corresponding power of 2 to the list.

3. The nth element is the difference between k and the sum of the first n-1 elements. This ensures that the sum of all elements in the list is equal to k, as required by the problem.

4. The program then prints the elements of the list as separate values, followed by zeros to fill the list to a length of n. This is done to ensure that the list has exactly n elements, as required by the problem.

5. The program repeats this process for each test case, until all input has been read.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
