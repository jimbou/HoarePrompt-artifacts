Output State: **k is 0, i is the third element in the list arr, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 and must have at least 3 elements, n is the value of the first integer in the input, k0 is equal to the original value of k, c is equal to the original value of c plus 2, ans is a list containing the original elements of ans plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of i and the new element k0 - sum(ans)**.

In this final state, the value of `k` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `i` is still the third element in the list `arr`. The list `arr` remains the same, containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and having at least 3 elements. The value of `n` is still the value of the first integer in the input. The value of `k0` is still equal to the original value of `k`. The value of `c` is still equal to the original value of `c` plus 2. The list `ans` now contains the original elements of `ans` plus the new element 1 shifted left by the value of `i` and the new element `k0 - sum(ans)`.
