Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: the first `n-1` elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the `n`th element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements, `_` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` has been extended with zeros to match the length of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the input in `stdin` is still present. The list `arr` is still empty, and the values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `c`, and `_` are the same as before.
