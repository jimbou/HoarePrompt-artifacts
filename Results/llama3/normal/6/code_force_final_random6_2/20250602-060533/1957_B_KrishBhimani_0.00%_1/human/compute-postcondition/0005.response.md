Postcondition: ***`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` must be non-zero, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0. If `k` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list.***
