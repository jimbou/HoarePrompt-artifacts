Output State: **n is an integer, k is 0, k0 is a positive integer, i is either 0 (if k0 is odd) or 1 (if k0 is even), c is either equal to n - 1 or less than n - 1 but greater than its original value, ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 shifted left by i, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, arr is a list containing either k0 elements (if k0 is odd) or k0-1 elements (if k0 is even).**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and the list `ans` now contains one element, which is the result of shifting 1 to the left by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is determined by whether `k0` is odd or even. The other variables remain unchanged.
