Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 1 and half its original value, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing a single element equal to 1 if `k` is an odd number, otherwise it is a list, `c` is equal to `n` + `len(arr)` - 1, `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0` - `sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0` - `sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n` - 1, and `ans` has been extended with `n` - `len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is equal to `k`.**
