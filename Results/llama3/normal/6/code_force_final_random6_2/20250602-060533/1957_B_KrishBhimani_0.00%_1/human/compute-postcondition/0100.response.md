The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. 

The list `ans` contains elements equal to 1 shifted left by the values of `i` for each element in `arr`. Since `i` is the last element in the list `arr`, and `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, the elements in `ans` are 1 shifted left by the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.

The list `ans` has been padded with zeros to a length of `n`, where `n` is the value of the first integer in the input.

If `c` is equal to `n`, then `ans` also contains the new element `k0 - sum(ans)`. However, since `k` is 0, `k0` is also 0, and `c` is equal to the original value of `c` plus the number of elements in `arr`, which is 0, `c` is not equal to `n`. Therefore, `ans` does not contain the new element `k0 - sum(ans)`.

Output: **A list of zeros of length n, with ones at the indices corresponding to the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0**
