Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a list of n elements, where the first n-1 elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the binary representation of k, and the nth element is the difference between k and the sum of the first n-1 elements. The function prints the elements of the list as separate values, followed by zeros to fill the list to a length of n. The function repeats this process for each test case, until all input has been read.**
