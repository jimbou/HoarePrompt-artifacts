The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least one more element the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least one more element and `i` is the next element in `arr`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is either equal to `n` or less than `n` but greater than its original value, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, and the second element is equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `arr` is a list containing either `k0` elements (if `k0` is odd) or `k0-1` elements (if `k0` is even), and has at least two more elements.**
