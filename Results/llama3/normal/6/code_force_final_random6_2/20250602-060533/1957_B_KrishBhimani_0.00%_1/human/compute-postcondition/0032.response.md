The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains `n` elements. The first `n-1` elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the `n`th element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements. Since `i` is the last element in `arr` and `arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined. However, since `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, the first `n-1` elements of `ans` are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, which are all zeros. Therefore, the first `n-1` elements of `ans` are all zeros. The `n`th element of `ans` is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements, which is equal to `k0` minus zero, which is equal to `k0`. Therefore, the `n`th element of `ans` is equal to `k0`.

Output: **[0, 0, ..., 0, k0] (where k0 is the value of k0 and there are n-1 zeros)**
