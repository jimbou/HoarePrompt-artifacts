Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer equal to k0 shifted right by 3 and k is not zero, k0 is an integer equal to k0, i is 3, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements: the first n-1 elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of i, and the nth element is equal to k0 minus the sum of the first n-1 elements, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is an odd number, arr is a list containing three elements: 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, arr is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2.**

In this output state, the value of k has been shifted right by one more bit, resulting in k being equal to k0 shifted right by 3. The value of i has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
