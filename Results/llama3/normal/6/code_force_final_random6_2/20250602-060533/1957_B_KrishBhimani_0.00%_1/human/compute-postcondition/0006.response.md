The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. The second line increments `i` by 1.

Output State: **t has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, n is an integer, k is equal to k0 divided by 2, k0 is equal to k multiplied by 2, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, _ is 0. If k0 is an odd number, arr is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.**
