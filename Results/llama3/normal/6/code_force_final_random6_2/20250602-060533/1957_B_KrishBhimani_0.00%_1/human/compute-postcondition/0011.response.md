The variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k.  If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is equal to k0 divided by 4 and k0 is not equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time k0 must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` has been read from stdin and is no longer in stdin, `n` is an integer, `k` is equal to `k0` divided by 4, `k0` is equal to `k` multiplied by 4 and `k0` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0. If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1. If `k0` is an even number, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1.**
