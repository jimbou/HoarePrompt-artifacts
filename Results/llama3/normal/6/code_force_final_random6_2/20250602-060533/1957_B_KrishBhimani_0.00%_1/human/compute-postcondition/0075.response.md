The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is half its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, k must not be equal to 0, which means that k0 must be greater than 1.
State: **k is greater than 1 and half its original value, i is 1, arr is a list, c is equal to n + len(arr) - 1, ans is a list containing a single element equal to k0, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of i, a third element equal to k0 - sum(ans), and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of i, and k0 - sum(ans) if c is equal to n - 1, and ans has been extended with n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, n is the value of the first integer in the input, and k0 is equal to k. If k is an odd number, arr contains a single element equal to 0.**
