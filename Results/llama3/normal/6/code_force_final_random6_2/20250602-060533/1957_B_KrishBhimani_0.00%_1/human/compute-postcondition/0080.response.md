Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing a single element equal to 1 if `k` is an odd number, otherwise it is a list, and the value 2 has been appended to it, `c` is equal to `n` + `len(arr)` - 1, `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0` - `sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0` - `sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n` - 1, and `ans` has been extended with `n` - `len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is greater than 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 2, and the list `arr` now contains the value 2 in addition to its previous element(s). The value of `c` remains the same, calculated as `n` plus the length of `arr` minus 1. The list `ans` still contains its previous elements, and its elements are still being printed. The loop has executed at least once, and `n` is still the value of the first integer in the input. The value of `k0` is still greater than 1.
