The code prints the elements of the list `ans` as separate values.
The list `ans` contains `n` elements: the first `n-1` elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the `n`th element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements.
Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `k0` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements: the first `n-1` elements are equal to 1 shifted left by the previous values of `i`, and the `n`th element is equal to `k0` minus the sum of the first `n-1` elements, `_` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and `ans` has been extended with `n - len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of `ans` are printed as separate values**
