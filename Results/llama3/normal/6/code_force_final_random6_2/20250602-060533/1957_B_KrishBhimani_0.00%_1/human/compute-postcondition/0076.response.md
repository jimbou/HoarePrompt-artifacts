Output State: **`k` is greater than 1 and half its original value, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing a single element equal to 1 if `k` is an odd number, otherwise it is a list, `c` is equal to `n` + `len(arr)` - 1, `ans` is a list containing a single element equal to `k0`, a second element equal to 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, a third element equal to `k0` - `sum(ans)`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0` - `sum(ans)` if `c` is equal to `n` - 1, and `ans` has been extended with `n` - `len(ans)` zeros, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once, `n` is the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is still greater than 1 and half its original value. The value of `i` remains 1. The list `arr` now contains an additional element equal to 1, but only if `k` is an odd number. The value of `c` is still equal to `n` plus the length of `arr` minus 1. The list `ans` remains the same, containing elements equal to `k0`, 1 shifted left by the previous value of `i`, `k0` minus the sum of `ans`, and additional elements equal to 1 shifted left by the current value of `i`, and `k0` minus the sum of `ans` if `c` is equal to `n` minus 1. The list `ans` has been extended with `n` minus the length of `ans` zeros. The elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the loop has executed at least once. The value of `n` is still the value of the first integer in the input, and `k0` is still equal to `k`.
