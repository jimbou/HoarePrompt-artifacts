Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+4, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx-1 in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, _ is n, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-2 in data.**

Explanation:

The first line assigns the integer value at index idx in data to n. Since n is at least 0, this line does not affect the value of n. The second line increments idx by 1, making idx equal to t+2t+2n+4. The third line creates a new list v with n+1 elements, all initialized to 0. This line does not affect any other variables.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution. The value of n is updated to the integer value at index idx-1 in data, which is at least 0. The list v is updated to have n+1 elements, all initialized to 0. The values of idx, t, results, data, _, i, cnt, and x remain unchanged.
