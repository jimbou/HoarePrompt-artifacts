Output State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 1, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is n. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the product of `v[i]`, `v[i] - 1`, and `v[i] - 2`, divided by 6, to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
