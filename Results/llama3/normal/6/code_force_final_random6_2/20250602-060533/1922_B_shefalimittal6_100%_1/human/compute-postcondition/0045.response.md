Output State: **`idx` is `t+2t+2n+3`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`. The current value of `v[i]` is at least 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and `v[i] - 1`, divided by 2. Since `cnt` is 0, the value of `ans` is also 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
