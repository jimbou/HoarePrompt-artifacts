Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+3, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data. If the value of v[i] is at least 3, then ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 and v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i in range n+1. Otherwise, ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i in range n+1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates over the range of n+1, and in each iteration, it updates the values of cnt and ans based on the value of v[i]. If v[i] is at least 3, it adds the product of cnt, v[i], and (v[i] - 1) divided by 2, and the product of v[i], (v[i] - 1), and (v[i] - 2) divided by 6 to ans. If v[i] is at least 2 but less than 3, it adds the product of cnt, v[i], and (v[i] - 1) divided by 2 to ans. After the loop finishes, the value of i is n, the value of cnt is 2n, and the value of ans is the sum of the products of cnt, v[i], and (v[i] - 1) divided by 2, and the products of v[i], (v[i] - 1), and (v[i] - 2) divided by 6 for all i in range n+1.
