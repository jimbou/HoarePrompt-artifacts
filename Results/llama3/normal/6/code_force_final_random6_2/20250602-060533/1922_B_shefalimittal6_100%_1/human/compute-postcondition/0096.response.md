Output State: **`idx` is `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing three string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24`, the second element is the string representation of `ans`, and the third element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `cnt` is `n + n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`, and `ans` is either `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, or `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1)` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains a third string element, which is the string representation of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `idx`, `t`, `data`, `n`, `v`, `_`, `i`, `cnt`, and `x` retaining their original values, and `ans` being either a specific value based on the condition or another specific value.
