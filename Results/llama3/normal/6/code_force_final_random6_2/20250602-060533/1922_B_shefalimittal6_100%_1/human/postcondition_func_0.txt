This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain an integer t, followed by t blocks of two lines, where the first line of each block contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. The function calculates a value for each block based on the occurrences of each integer and prints the results as a list of strings, one for each block. The calculation involves counting the number of pairs and triples of each integer and summing up the counts. The function does not modify the input data and does not have any side effects other than printing the results.
