Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+3, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx in data, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has iterated 'n' times, and in each iteration, it has incremented the 'idx' variable by 1, and updated the 'v' list by incrementing the element at index 'x' by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
