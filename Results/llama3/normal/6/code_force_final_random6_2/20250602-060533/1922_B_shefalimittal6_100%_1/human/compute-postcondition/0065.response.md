The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is n-1, `t` is an integer greater than n. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is n and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than n.
State: **idx is t+2t+2n+3, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data. If the value of v[i] is at least 3, then ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 and v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i in range n+1. Otherwise, ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i in range n+1.**
