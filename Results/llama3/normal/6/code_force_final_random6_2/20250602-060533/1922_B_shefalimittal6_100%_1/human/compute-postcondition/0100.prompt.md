You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+2t lines. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the next t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3*10^5) and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). The sum of n over all blocks does not exceed 3*10^5.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: idx is t+2t+2t+1, t is 0, results is a list containing t string elements where each element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx-n-1 in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n+1, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data, and ans is either cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 if v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, or cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) otherwise.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the string representation of ans, repeated t times, where ans is either cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 if v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, or cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) otherwise, and v[i] is n, and n is at least 0

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
