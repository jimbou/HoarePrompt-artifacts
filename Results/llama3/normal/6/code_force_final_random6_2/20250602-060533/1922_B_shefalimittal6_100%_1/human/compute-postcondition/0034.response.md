Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+3, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx in data, v is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, _ is n, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `idx`, and `v`. The first line assigns the integer value at index `idx` in `data` to `n`, effectively updating the value of `n`. The second line increments `idx` by 1. The third line reinitializes `v` as a list of `n+1` elements, all of which are 0. The values of `t`, `results`, `data`, `_`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
