To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable, and `n`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `n` is still an integer greater than 1

The other variables in the state, such as `idx`, `t`, `results`, `data`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, and `x`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`idx` is t+2t+2n+6, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24` and the second element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `2n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx` in `data`**
