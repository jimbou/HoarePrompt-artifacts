The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, idx is t+2t+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **idx is t+2t+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 zeros, _ is 0**
