Output: **idx is t+2t+2t+1, t is 0, results is a list containing t string elements where each element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx-n-1 in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n+1, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data, and ans is either cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 if v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, or cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) otherwise, and the string representation of ans is printed t times**
