Output State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 2, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2n, `ans` is 0 + 2n * 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 = 0 + 0 * (-1) // 6 = 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 0 + 0 * (-1) // 6 = 0, since the value of `v` at index `i` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
