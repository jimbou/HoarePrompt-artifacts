Output State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 0, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is n, If the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been updated to be equal to `n`, which is the value of the element at index `i` in the list `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `v[i]`, but now it is calculated using the updated value of `cnt`.
