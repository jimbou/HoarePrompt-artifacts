To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is `n-1`, and `t` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is `n`, and `t` is an integer greater than `n`.

The other variables in the state, such as `idx`, `results`, `data`, `n`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `n*(n+1)/2`, `ans` is `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24**
