Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+7, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n must be greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 3 and all other elements are 0, _ is 2, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data**

Explanation:
The code block modifies the values of `idx`, `x`, and `v`. Initially, `idx` is `t+2t+n+6`, and `x` is the integer value of the element at index `idx` in `data`. The first line assigns the integer value of the element at index `idx` in `data` to `x`. The second line increments `idx` by 1, making it `t+2t+n+7`. The third line increments the value of the element at index `x` in `v` by 1. Since `x` is the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`, the element at index `x` in `v` becomes 3. All other elements in `v` remain 0. The values of `t`, `results`, `data`, `n`, `_`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
