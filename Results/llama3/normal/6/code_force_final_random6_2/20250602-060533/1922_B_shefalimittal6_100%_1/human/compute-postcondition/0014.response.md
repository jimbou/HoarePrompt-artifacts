Postcondition: ***`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 0, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 0. If the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.***
