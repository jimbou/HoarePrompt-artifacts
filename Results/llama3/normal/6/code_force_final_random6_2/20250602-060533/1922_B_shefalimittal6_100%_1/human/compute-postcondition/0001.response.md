To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` because it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, the adjusted state is:


State: **stdin is empty, data is a list of t+2t lines, idx is t+2t+1, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list**
