Output State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 1, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2n. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `ans` is `2n * n * (n - 1) // 2 + 2n * n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, then `ans` is `2n * n * (n - 1) // 2 + 2n * n * (n - 1) // 2**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been updated to 2n by adding the value of `v[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `v[i]`, but now `cnt` is 2n.
