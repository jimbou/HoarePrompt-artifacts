Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, data is a list of t+2t lines, idx is t+2t+1, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is t+2t+n+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: idx is t+2t+2n+3, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data. If the value of v[i] is at least 3, then ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 and v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i in range n+1. Otherwise, ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i in range n+1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx` is `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing three string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24`, the second element is the string representation of `ans`, and the third element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `cnt` is `n + n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`, and `ans` is either `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, or `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1)` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
