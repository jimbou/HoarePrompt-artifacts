Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+7, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 3 and all other elements are 0, _ is 2, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `x` has been updated to the integer value of the element at the new `idx` index in the `data` list. The value of `v[x]` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
