To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-2` in `data` and is at least 1. We also know that `_` is 0.

To execute the loop again, the loop head must be re-evaluated. Since `_` is 0, it will be incremented to 1. The `range(n)` will be re-evaluated, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `_` is incremented to 1
* `n` must be greater than 1 (since it was at least 1 previously)

The other variables in the state, such as `idx`, `t`, `results`, `data`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, and `x`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`idx` is t+2t+2n+5, `t` is an integer greater than n, `results` is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 1 and all other elements are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is n, `cnt` is 2n, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data**
