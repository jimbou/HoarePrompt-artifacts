Postcondition: ***`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 2, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2n. If the value of `v` at index `i` is greater than or equal to 2, then `ans` is 0 + 2n * 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 = 0.***
