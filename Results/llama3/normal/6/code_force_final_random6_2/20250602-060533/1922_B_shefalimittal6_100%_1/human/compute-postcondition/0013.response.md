Output State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 0, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0. The current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and `v[i] - 1`, divided by 2. Since `cnt` is 0, the value of `ans` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
