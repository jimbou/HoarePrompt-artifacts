Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is t+2t+2n+n+1, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx-n-1 in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is 0, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24` and the second element is the string representation of `ans`. `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx` is `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24` and the second element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `cnt` is `n + n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` which is equal to `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx` is `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24` and the second element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is `n+2`, `cnt` is `n + n + v[i]`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is 2, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` which is equal to `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
