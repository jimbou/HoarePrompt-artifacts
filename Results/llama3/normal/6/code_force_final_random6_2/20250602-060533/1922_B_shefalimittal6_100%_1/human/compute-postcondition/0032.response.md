Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string representation of `ans`, which is the result of the expression `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24`. All other variables remain unchanged.
