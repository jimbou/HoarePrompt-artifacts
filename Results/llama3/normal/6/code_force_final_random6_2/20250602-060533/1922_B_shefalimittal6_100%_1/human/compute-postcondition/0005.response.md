The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **idx is t+2t+3, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 1 and all other elements are 0, _ is 1**
