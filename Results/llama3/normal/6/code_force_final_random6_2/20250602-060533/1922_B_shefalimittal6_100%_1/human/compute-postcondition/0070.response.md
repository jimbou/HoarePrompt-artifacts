Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+6, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 2 and all other elements are 0, _ is 1, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx in data**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of the element at index `idx` in `data` to `x`. Since `idx` is `t+2t+2n+5`, `x` becomes the integer value of the element at index `t+2t+2n+5` in `data`. The second line increments `idx` by 1, making `idx` equal to `t+2t+2n+6`. The third line increments the value of the element at index `x` in `v` by 1. Since `x` is the integer value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`, the element at index `x` in `v` becomes 2. No other variables are affected.
