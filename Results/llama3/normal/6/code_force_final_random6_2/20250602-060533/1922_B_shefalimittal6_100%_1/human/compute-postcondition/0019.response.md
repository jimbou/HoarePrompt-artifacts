The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 1.
State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 1, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is n, If the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`**
