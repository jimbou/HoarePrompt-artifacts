Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+n+1, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx-n-1 in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n+1, cnt is n + n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data. If v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, ans is cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6. Otherwise, ans is cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 which is equal to cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop iterates n+1 times, and since n is at least 0, the loop will execute at least 1 time. After the loop executes 3 times, the value of i is n+1, which is the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
