Output State: **`idx` is `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24` and the second element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `idx` is still `t+2t+2n+n+1`, `t` is still an integer greater than `n`, `results` is still a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24` and the second element is the string representation of `ans`, `data` is still a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is still an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx-n-1` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is still a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is still `n-1`, `i` is still `n+1`, `cnt` is still `n`, `x` is still an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`. The only change is that `ans` has been updated to `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
