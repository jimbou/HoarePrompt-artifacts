Output State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 1, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is n, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and `v[i] - 1`, divided by 2, to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `v[i]` is 1 (because `i` is 1 and `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0), `ans` is now `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `cnt * 1 * 0 // 2 + cnt * 1 * 0 // 2`, which is 0.
