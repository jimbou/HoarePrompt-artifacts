Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. 

The program first reads the input and stores the counts of each stick length in the array `v`. Then, it iterates over the array and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle. 

The calculation involves two cases: 

1. When there are at least two sticks of the same length, the program adds the number of ways to choose one stick from the previous sticks and two sticks from the current sticks to the answer. 

2. When there are at least three sticks of the same length, the program adds the number of ways to choose three sticks from the current sticks to the answer. 

The program correctly handles the cases when there are less than two or three sticks of the same length, and it does not count the cases when the three sticks are the same length more than once. 

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Correctness: **True**
