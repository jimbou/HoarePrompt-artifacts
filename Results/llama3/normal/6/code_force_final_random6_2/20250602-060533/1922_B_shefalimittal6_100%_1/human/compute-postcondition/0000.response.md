Output State: **stdin is empty, data is a list of t+2t lines, idx is t+2t+1, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, results is an empty list.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the standard input (stdin) is empty because the `input()` function has read all the lines. The `data` variable now holds a list of all the lines that were in stdin, which consists of `t+2t` lines. The `idx` variable has been incremented to `t+2t+1`, indicating that all lines have been processed. The `t` variable holds an integer value between 1 and 10^4, which was read from the first line of stdin. Finally, the `results` variable is an empty list, waiting to be populated with results from future computations.
