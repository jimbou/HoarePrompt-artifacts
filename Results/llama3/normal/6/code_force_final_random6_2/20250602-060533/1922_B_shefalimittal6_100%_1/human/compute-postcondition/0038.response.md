Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+6, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n must be greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 2 and all other elements are 0, _ is 1, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx in data**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx`, `x`, and `v`. The first line assigns the value of the element at index `idx` in `data` to `x`. Since `idx` is initially `t+2t+n+5`, `x` becomes the value of the element at index `t+2t+n+5` in `data`. The second line increments `idx` by 1, making it `t+2t+n+6`. The third line increments the value of the element at index `x` in `v` by 1. Since `x` is now the value of the element at index `t+2t+n+5` in `data`, the element at index `x` in `v` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
