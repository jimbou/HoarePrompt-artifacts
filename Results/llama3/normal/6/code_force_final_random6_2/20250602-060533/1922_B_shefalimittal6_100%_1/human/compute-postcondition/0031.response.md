Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates n+1 times, and in each iteration, it updates the value of cnt and ans. The final value of cnt is the sum of all elements in the list v, which is n*(n+1)/2. The final value of ans is the sum of all products of three distinct elements in the list v, which is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24.
