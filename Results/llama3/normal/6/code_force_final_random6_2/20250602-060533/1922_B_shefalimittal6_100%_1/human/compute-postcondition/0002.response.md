Output State: **idx is t+2t+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 zeros**

The code first assigns the integer value of the element at index `idx` in the `data` list to `n`. Since `idx` is `t+2t+1`, `n` becomes the integer value at that index in the `data` list. The second line increments `idx` by 1, making it `t+2t+2`. The third line creates a new list `v` with `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `results`, and `data` remain unchanged.
