Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index `idx` has moved `n` steps forward, the list `v` has been updated to have `n` occurrences of the element at index `x`, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
