To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute.

State: **`idx` is t+2t+n+2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of t+2t lines, `n` must be at least 0, `v` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, `_` is n-1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
