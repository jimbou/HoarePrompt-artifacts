The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **idx is t+2t+n+6, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n must be greater than 1, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 2 and all other elements are 0, _ is 2, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx in data**
