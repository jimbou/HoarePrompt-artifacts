Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+n+1, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing two string elements where the first element is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24 and the second element is the string representation of ans, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx-n-1 in data and is at least 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is 2n, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, and the variable idx has been incremented by n+1. The variable v now has the element at index x equal to n, and all other elements are 0. The variable _ has been decremented to n-1, and the variable x is now equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data. The other variables remain unchanged.
