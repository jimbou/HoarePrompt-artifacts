Output State: **idx is t+2t+n+2, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, cnt is 0, ans is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each initializing a new variable to 0. The first line assigns 0 to the variable `cnt`, and the second line assigns 0 to the variable `ans`. These assignments do not affect any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state includes the newly introduced variables `cnt` and `ans` with their assigned values, while all other variables retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.
