Output State: **`idx` is `t+2t+2n+3`, `t` is an integer greater than `n`, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of `n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24`, `data` is a list of `t+2t` lines, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value at index `idx` in `data` and is at least 0, `v` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `x` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of the element at index `idx-1` in `data`. If the value of `v[i]` is at least 3, then `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to `n`, which is the value of the element at index `x` in `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `v[i]`, but now `cnt` is `n`.
