State: **idx is t+2t+n+5, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n must be greater than 0, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is 1 and all other elements are 0, _ is 1, i is n, cnt is n*(n+1)/2, ans is n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data**
