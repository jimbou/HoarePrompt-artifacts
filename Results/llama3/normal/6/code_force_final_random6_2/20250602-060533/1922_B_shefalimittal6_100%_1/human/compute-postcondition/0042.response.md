Output State: **idx is t+2t+2n+3, t is an integer greater than n, results is a list containing one string element which is the string representation of n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(3n-1)//24, data is a list of t+2t lines, n is an integer equal to the integer value at index idx in data, v is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index x is n and all other elements are 0, _ is n-1, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index idx-1 in data**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value of 0 to the variables `cnt` and `ans`, respectively. The initial state provides values for various variables, including `idx`, `t`, `results`, `data`, `n`, `v`, `_`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `x`. After executing the code, the values of `cnt` and `ans` are updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged.
