Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`***
