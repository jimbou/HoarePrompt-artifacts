The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 0, so the new value of `cnt` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 1, ans is equal to n, i is 0, and the current value of a[i] is equal to tmp.
