Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1).**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 2 and `ans` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is now 1 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
