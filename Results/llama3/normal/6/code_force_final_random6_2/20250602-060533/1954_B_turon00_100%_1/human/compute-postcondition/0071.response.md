Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`. The current value of `n` is either 1 or equal to `ans`, and -1 is printed**
