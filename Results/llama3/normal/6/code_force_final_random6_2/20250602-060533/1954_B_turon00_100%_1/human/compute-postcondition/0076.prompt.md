Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` which is `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`, is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
