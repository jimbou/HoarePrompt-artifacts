Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element or reaches the end of the array. If the minimum count is equal to the length of the array or the array contains only one element, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only considers the consecutive occurrences of the first element, but it does not consider the case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements that are not the first element. For example, in the test case [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3], the program will print 3, but the correct answer is 1, because removing the single occurrence of 5 is enough to make the array non-beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
