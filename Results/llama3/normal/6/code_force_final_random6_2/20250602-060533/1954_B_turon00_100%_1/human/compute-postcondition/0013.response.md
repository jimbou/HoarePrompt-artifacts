To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1).**
