The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. Since `i` is 2, we need to check the value of `a[2]` and compare it with `tmp`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact values of `a[2]` and `tmp`. Therefore, we can only update the value of `cnt` based on the given condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2 if `a[2]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is 0**
