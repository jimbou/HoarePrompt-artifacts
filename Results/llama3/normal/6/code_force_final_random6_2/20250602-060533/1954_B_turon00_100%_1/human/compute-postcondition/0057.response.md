Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, stdin is empty, and the current element of a (a[i]) is not equal to tmp**

The code snippet updates the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected.
