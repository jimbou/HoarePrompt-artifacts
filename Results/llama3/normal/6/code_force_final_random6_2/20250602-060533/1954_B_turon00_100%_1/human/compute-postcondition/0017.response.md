Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is n, cnt is the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp at the end of a, ans is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, stdin, n, a, and tmp as in the initial state. The loop counter i will be equal to n, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable cnt will store the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp at the end of list a. The variable ans will store the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in list a.
