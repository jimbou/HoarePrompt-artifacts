Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`.
