Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 3 or 1, `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to either 3 or 1, depending on whether the current element of `a` (a[i]) is equal to `tmp`. If a[i] is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3; otherwise, `cnt` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
