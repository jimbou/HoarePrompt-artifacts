Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 0, cnt is 1, ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, stdin is empty. The current value of a[i] is equal to tmp.**

In this output state, the value of cnt has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of ans is still the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, but since cnt has increased, the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a has also increased. The current value of a[i] is still equal to tmp, indicating that the sequence of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a has not been broken.
