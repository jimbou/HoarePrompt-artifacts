Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 2, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 2, and `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`, `ans` will be either 0 or 2, depending on the value of `cnt`. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is not affected as it is already empty.
