Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is equal to `n`. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1). If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` and `cnt` is 0, then `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1).***
