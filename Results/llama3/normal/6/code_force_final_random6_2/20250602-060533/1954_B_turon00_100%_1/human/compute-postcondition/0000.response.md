The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since stdin contains t test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers, the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs are still in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers.**
