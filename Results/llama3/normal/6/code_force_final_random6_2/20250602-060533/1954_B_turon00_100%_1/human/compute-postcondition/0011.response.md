Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the original cnt, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the original value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` was 0 or 1, `ans` is now the minimum of its original value and 0 or 1. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
