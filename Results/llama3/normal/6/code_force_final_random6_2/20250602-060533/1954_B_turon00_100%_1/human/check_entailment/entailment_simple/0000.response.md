Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes a variable `tmp` to the first element of the array `a`.
4. It initializes a variable `cnt` to 0, which will be used to count the consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the array.
5. It initializes a variable `ans` to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.
6. It then iterates through the array `a`. If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
7. After the loop, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one last time.
8. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful. It does this by counting the consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array, and updating the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element.

Correctness: **True**
