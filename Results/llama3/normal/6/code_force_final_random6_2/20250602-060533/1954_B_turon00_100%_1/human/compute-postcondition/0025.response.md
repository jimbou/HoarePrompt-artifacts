Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` which is `ans` is printed.***
