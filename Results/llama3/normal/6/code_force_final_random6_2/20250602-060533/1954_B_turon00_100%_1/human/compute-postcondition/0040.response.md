Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 2, cnt is 0, and ans is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially 0 and `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `ans` remains 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values. The final state includes all the variables with their updated values after the execution of the code.
