The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is equal to n does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is equal to n, i is 0**
