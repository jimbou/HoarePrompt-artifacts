Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty. If the current element of `a` (a[i]) is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`.**
