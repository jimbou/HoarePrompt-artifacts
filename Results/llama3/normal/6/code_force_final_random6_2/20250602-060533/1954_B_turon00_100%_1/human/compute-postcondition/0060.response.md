Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2 if the current element of `a` (a[i]) is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current element of `a` (a[i]) is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
