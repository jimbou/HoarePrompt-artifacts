Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the original cnt, and i is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and the original `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 0, `stdin` still contains `t-2` test cases, `n` remains an integer greater than 0, `a` is still a list of integers, `tmp` is still equal to the first element of `a`, and `i` remains 0. The current element of `a` at index `i` is still not equal to `tmp`.
