The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0.

Since `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the value of `ans` will be either the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` or 0.

Output: **the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and 0 (where tmp is the first element of a)**
