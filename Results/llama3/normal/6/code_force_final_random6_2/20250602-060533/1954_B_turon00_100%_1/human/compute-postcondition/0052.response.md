Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer from stdin, a is a list of integers from stdin, tmp is the first element of a, i is not defined, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, stdin is empty**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, overwriting its previous value. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`, overwriting its previous value. The first element of `a` is assigned to `tmp`, overwriting its previous value. The variable `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, so its value is not updated. The variable `cnt` is set to 0, regardless of its previous value. The variable `ans` is set to the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
