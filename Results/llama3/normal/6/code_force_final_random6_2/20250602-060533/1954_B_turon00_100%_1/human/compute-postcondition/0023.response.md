The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. 

`cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, where `tmp` is the first element of `a`. 

Since `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and either `n` is not equal to 1 or `ans` is not equal to `n`, the value of `ans` will be the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a` that is less than `n` or not equal to `n`.

Output: **the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp at the end of a that is less than n or not equal to n**
