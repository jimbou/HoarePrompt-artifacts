Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in a list of integers. If the list contains only one element or the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the list length, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.**
