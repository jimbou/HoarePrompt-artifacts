stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). The array a is beautiful, meaning that all its elements can be made the same by using the given operation an arbitrary number of times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
