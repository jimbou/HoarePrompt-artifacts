Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers from stdin, tmp is the first element of a, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, stdin is empty. The current value of a[i] is equal to tmp.**
