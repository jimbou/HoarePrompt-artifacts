Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array contains only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] will return 1, but the correct answer is 2, because we need to remove at least two elements to make the array not beautiful.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements, but it does not consider the case when the elements are alternating. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check for the minimum count of alternating elements as well.
