Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element. If the array contains only one element or the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the array length, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It initializes the minimum number of consecutive occurrences to the length of the array and then updates it as it iterates through the array. It also correctly handles the edge cases where the array contains only one element or the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the array length.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
