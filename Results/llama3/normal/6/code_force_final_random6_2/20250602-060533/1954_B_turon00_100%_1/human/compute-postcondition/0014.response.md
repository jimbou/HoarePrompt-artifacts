Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is equal to `n`. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current element of the list `a` at index `i` is equal to the temporary value `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 3 and `ans` remains equal to `n`. If the current element of `a` at index `i` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 2 and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the original value of `cnt`, which is 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
