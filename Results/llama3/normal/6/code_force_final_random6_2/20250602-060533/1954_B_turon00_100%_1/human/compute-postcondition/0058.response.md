Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 0, stdin is empty. If the current element of a (a[i]) is equal to tmp, then cnt is 1 and ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, and the current element of a (a[i]) is not equal to tmp.**
