Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`, is printed.**
