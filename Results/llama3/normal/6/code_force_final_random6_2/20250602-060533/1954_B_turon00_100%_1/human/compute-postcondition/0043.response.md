Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 1, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of integers, `tmp` is still the first element of `a`, `i` is still `n`, `cnt` is still `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is still 0. The only change is in `ans`, which is now the minimum of its original value (the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`) and `cnt` (which is `n` if all elements of `a` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise 0).
