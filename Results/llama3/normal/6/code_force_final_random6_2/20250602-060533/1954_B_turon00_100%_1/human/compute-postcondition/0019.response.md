Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The current value of `n` is either 1 or equal to `ans`. stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**
