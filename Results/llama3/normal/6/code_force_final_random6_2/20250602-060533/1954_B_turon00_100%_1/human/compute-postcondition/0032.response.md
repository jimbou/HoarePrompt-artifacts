Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and 0, i is 0, and the current element of a (a[i]) is not equal to tmp**

Explanation:

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0.

The initial state provides the following information:

* `t` is an integer greater than 1
* `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0
* `a` is a list of integers from stdin
* `tmp` is the first element of `a`
* `cnt` is 0
* `ans` is `n`
* `i` is 0
* stdin is empty
* The current element of `a` (a[i]) is not equal to `tmp`

After executing the code, the following changes occur:

* `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (`n`) and 0. Since `n` is greater than 0, `ans` becomes 0.
* `cnt` is reset to 0.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is 0, i is 0, and the current element of a (a[i]) is not equal to tmp**
