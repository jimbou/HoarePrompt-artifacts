Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 1, cnt is 0, ans is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially 0 and `cnt` is also 0, `ans` remains 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0, which doesn't change its value since it was already 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
