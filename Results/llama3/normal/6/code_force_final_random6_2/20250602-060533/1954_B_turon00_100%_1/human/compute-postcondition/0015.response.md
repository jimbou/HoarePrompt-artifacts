Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 2, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the original cnt (which is 1).**

The code first assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and the original `cnt` (which is 1) to `ans`. This means that `ans` will be either its original value or 1, whichever is smaller. Then, it resets `cnt` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
