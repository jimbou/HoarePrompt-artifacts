Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is equal to n**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, leaving `t-2` test cases. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input. The list `a` is populated with integers from the input, and `tmp` is set to the first element of `a`. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and `ans` is set to the value of `n`.
