The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. Since `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, and `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of these two values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**
