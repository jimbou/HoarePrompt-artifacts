The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the original `cnt`.**
