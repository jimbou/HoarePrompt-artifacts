The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 0, so the new value of `cnt` is 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
