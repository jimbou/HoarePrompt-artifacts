Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`, is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input. The loop has iterated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. In each iteration, the loop has processed a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The loop has kept track of the first element of `a` in the variable `tmp`, and has counted the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a` in the variable `cnt`. The loop has also kept track of the minimum of `cnt` and `n` in the variable `ans`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the loop has printed -1. Otherwise, the loop has printed the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`.
