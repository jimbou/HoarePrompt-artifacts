Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is n, stdin is empty. cnt is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a starting from the last element of a, and ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`. The value of `ans` is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
