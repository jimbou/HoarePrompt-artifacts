To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer and stdin contains `t-1` test cases, we can infer that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
