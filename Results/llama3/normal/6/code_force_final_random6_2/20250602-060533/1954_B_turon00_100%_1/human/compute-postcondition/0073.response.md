The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of `cnt` and `n`. Since `ans` is less than `n`, it means `cnt` is less than `n`.

`cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`. Since `cnt` is less than `n`, it means there are less than `n` consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` starting from the last element of `a`, which is less than `n`.

Output: **the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a starting from the last element of a (which is less than n)**
