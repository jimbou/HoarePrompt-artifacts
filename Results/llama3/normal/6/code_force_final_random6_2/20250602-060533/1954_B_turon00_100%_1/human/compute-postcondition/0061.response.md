Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is the first element of a, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a and n, cnt is 0, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and `n`, and `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
