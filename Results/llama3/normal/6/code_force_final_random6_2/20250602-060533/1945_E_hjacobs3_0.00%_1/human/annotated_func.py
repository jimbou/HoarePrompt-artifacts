#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: l is equal to r + 1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two elements: the string representation of l+1, where l is equal to r+1 and is not equal to the index of the element 'find' in the array, and the string representation of the index of the element 'find' in the array plus 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: l is equal to r + 1, and l is equal to array.index(find), and this is printed: 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of distinct integers to find a target value. If the target value is found, it returns a list containing the index of the target value plus one, and the index of the target value in the original list plus one. If the target value is not found, it prints 0. The function takes a list of integers and a target integer as input, and returns a list of two string representations of indices, or prints 0 if the target is found at the expected index.
