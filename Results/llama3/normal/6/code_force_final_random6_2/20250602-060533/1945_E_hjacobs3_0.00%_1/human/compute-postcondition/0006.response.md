Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is the length of array, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, and the value of `array[mid]` is less than `find`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `mid` and the average of `l` and `r` is still valid, and the value of `array[mid]` is still less than `find`.
