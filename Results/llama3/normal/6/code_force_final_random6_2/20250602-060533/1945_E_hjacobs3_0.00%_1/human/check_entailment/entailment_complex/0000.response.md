Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search, but the permutation is not sorted. To solve this, the program is allowed to swap two elements in the permutation at most twice before performing the binary search.

2. The program first reads the input, which includes the size of the permutation `n`, the number to be found `x`, and the permutation `p` itself.

3. The program then calls the function `func_1` with the permutation `p` and the number to be found `x` as arguments.

4. Inside the function `func_1`, the program performs a binary search on the permutation `p` to find the number `x`. The binary search is implemented correctly, with the `l` and `r` variables representing the left and right boundaries of the search range, and the `mid` variable representing the middle index of the search range.

5. After the binary search, the program checks if the index `l` is equal to the index of the number `x` in the permutation `p`. If they are not equal, it means that the number `x` is not at the expected index, and the program prints `1` to indicate that one swap operation is needed.

6. The program then returns a list containing the index `l+1` and the index of the number `x` in the permutation `p` plus one. These indices represent the positions of the two elements that need to be swapped to move the number `x` to the expected index.

7. If the index `l` is equal to the index of the number `x` in the permutation `p`, it means that the number `x` is already at the expected index, and the program prints `0` to indicate that no swap operations are needed.

8. The program repeats this process for each test case, reading the input, calling the function `func_1`, and printing the result.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where the number `x` is not at the expected index by printing the indices of the two elements that need to be swapped.

Correctness: **True**
