Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program implements a binary search algorithm on a permutation array to find a given number x. The binary search algorithm is applied after at most two swap operations are performed on the array to ensure that the array is sorted.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation array and the number to be found. It then reads the permutation array.

The function `func_1` is called with the permutation array and the number to be found as arguments. This function performs a binary search on the array to find the number. If the number is not found at the expected index, it means that the array is not sorted, and a swap operation is needed.

The function prints the number of swap operations needed (0 or 1) and the indices of the elements to be swapped. If no swap operation is needed, it prints 0.

The program then decrements the number of test cases and repeats the process until all test cases are processed.

The execution states of the program provided as comments show that the program correctly handles different scenarios, including when the number to be found is already at the correct index and when a swap operation is needed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
