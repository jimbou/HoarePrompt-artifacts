Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid` - 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, and the current value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `array` remains unchanged, containing distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. The value of `find` is still an integer between 1 and `n`. The length of `array` is still `n`. The left boundary `l` is still 0. The right boundary `r` has been updated to `mid` - 1. The middle index `mid` is still the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`. The value of `array[mid]` is still greater than or equal to `find`.
