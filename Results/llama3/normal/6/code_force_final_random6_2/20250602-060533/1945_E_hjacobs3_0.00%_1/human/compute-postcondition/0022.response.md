Output State: **The program returns a list containing two elements: the string representation of l+1, where l is equal to r+1 and is not equal to the index of the element 'find' in the array, and the string representation of the index of the element 'find' in the array plus 1.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list with two strings. The first string is the value of l (which is r+1) incremented by 1, converted to a string. The second string is the index of the element 'find' in the array, incremented by 1, converted to a string.
