Output State: **l is equal to r + 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `l` will be one more than the value of `r`. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and in each iteration, `l` and `r` are updated such that `l` is either increased or `r` is decreased. Eventually, `l` will become greater than `r`, at which point the loop will terminate.
