This function performs a binary search on a list of distinct integers to find a target value. If the target value is found, it returns a list containing the index of the target value plus one, and the index of the target value in the original list plus one. If the target value is not found, it prints 0. The function takes a list of integers and a target integer as input, and returns a list of two string representations of indices, or prints 0 if the target is found at the expected index.
