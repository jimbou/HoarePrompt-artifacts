Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are updated such that if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `r` is less than `mid`, otherwise, `l` is the integer average of `mid` and `r` plus 1***
