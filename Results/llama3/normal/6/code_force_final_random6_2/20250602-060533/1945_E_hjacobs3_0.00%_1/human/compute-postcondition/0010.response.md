Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2, `r` is `mid - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `mid - 1`, which means the right boundary of the search range has been narrowed down. The other variables remain unchanged, with `array` still being a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` being an integer from 1 to `n`, and `n` being the length of `array`. The relationship between `l` and `r` has also been updated, with `l` now being less than or equal to `mid - 1`.
