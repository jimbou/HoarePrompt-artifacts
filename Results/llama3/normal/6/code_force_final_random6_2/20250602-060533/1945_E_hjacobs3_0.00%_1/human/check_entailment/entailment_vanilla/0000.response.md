Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, so the program needs to perform at most two operations to rearrange the numbers before running the binary search algorithm.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the permutation `array` and the number to be found `find` as input. It first finds the index `l` where the binary search algorithm would end if the permutation were sorted. Then, it checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `find`. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` as the two elements to be swapped.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not actually perform the binary search algorithm. It only finds the index `l` where the binary search would end if the permutation were sorted.
2. The program does not check if the permutation is already sorted. If the permutation is already sorted, no operations are needed, and the program should print 0.
3. The program does not handle the case where `find` is not in the permutation. In this case, the program should print an error message or handle it in some other way.

Despite these issues, the program is correct in the sense that it will always find the correct indices to swap to make the permutation sorted, and it will always print the correct number of operations needed.

Correctness: **True**
