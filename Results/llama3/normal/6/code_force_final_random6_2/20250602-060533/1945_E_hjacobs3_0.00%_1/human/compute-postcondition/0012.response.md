Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1` and `r` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `mid + 1` and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.***
