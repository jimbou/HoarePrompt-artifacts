Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program performs a binary search on a list of distinct integers to find a target value. If the target value is found, it returns a list containing the index of the target value plus one, and the index of the target value in the original list plus one. If the target value is not found, it prints 0. This behavior matches the problem description, which requires the program to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. The program achieves this by swapping the elements at positions i and j if necessary.

Correctness: **True**
