Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `mid` is the integer average of `l` and `r`, `r` is less than `mid`**.

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be `mid - 1`, which is less than `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still valid, but now `r` is specifically less than `mid`.
