Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be `mid + 1`, which means it is now greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships with each other are still valid. The array and find variables are still as they were before, and n is still the length of the array. The relationship between l and r is also still valid, with r being greater than or equal to l.
