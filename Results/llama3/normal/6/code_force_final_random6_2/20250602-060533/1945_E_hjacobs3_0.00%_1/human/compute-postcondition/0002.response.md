Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is the length of array, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, which are 0 and n-1 respectively. Therefore, `mid` is equal to `(0 + n - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
