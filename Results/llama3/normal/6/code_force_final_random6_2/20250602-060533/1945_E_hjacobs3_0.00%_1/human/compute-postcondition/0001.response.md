To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `l <= r`. Given the initial states:

- `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order.
- `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

The condition `l <= r` will always be true given the initial values of `l` and `r`, since `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, and `n` is a positive integer (as it represents the length of `array`). Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1**
