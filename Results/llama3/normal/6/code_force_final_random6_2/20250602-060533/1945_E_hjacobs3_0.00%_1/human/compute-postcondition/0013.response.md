To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `r` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, we have two possible scenarios:

1. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1` and `r` is `mid - 1`. In this case, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.
2. If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` is equal to `mid + 1` and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. In this case, `r` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.

Since we don't know which scenario occurred, we need to adjust both `l` and `r` to ensure the loop can execute again. Specifically, we need to ensure that `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`.**
