To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `l <= r`. The loop will execute again if this condition is true.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order.
- `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`.
- `n` is the length of `array`.

The loop head variables are `l` and `r`. According to the code, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid` - 1. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid` + 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `r` so that `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Since `l` and `r` are updated based on the comparison of `array[mid]` and `find`, we need to consider the possible values of `mid`.

If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid` - 1. In this case, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid` - 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` is updated to `mid` + 1. In this case, `r` must be greater than or equal to `mid` + 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

Since we don't know the exact values of `array[mid]` and `find`, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `r` so that `l` is less than or equal to `r` in both cases.

Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
