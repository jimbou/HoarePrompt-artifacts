Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the integer average of `mid` and `r` plus 1, `mid` is the integer average of `l` and `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be the integer average of `mid` and `r` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` has also been updated to reflect that `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, since `l` has been incremented by 1.
