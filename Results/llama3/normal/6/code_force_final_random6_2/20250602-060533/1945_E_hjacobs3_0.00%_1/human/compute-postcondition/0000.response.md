Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1**

The code assigns the length of the array to the variable n, and then assigns the values 0 and n - 1 to the variables l and r, respectively. The array and find variables remain unchanged.
