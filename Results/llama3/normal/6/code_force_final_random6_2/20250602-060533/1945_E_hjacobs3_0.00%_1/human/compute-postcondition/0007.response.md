Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is the length of `array`. After the if-else block, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid` - 1. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid` + 1, and `mid` is recalculated as the integer part of the average of the new `l` and `r`.***
