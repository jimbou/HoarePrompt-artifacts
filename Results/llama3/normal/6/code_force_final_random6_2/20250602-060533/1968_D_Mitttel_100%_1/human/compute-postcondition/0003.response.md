To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `vis`, `s`, and `k` because they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `vis`, `s`, and `k`. If `vis[s]` is not equal to 1 and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `vis[s]` is 1, `k` is equal to `k - 1`, and `s` is equal to `p[s]`. `vis[s]` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `vis[s]` is not equal to 1. `k` being equal to `k - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1. `s` being equal to `p[s]` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not equal to `p[s]`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `p` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), `s` is an integer not equal to p[s], `k` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the length of p, `mx` is the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], `cur` is equal to cur + a[s], and `vis` is a list of zeros of length n with vis[s] not equal to 1**
