Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. In the game, each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation. However, in the program, the player always moves to the position indicated by the permutation. This means that the program does not correctly simulate the game, and the results it produces are not accurate.

For example, consider the case where the permutation is [2, 1], the array is [1, 1], and the starting positions are 1 and 2. In this case, the program will always move the players to the opposite position, resulting in a score of 2 for both players. However, in the actual game, the players can choose to stay at their current position, resulting in a score of 1 for both players. Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game in this case.
