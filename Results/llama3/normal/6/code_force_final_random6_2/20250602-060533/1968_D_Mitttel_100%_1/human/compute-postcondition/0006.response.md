Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is an integer equal to p[s], k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + 3 * a[s], and vis is a list of integers of length n with vis[s] equal to 1 and other values unchanged.**

The code modifies the values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, `k`, and `s`. The first line sets `vis[s]` to 1. The second line updates `mx` to be the maximum of its original value and `cur + k * a[s]`. The third line increments `cur` by `a[s]`. The fourth line decrements `k` by 1. The fifth line updates `s` to be `p[s]`. The values of `a`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged.
