Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is an integer equal to p[s], k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + 2 * a[s], and vis is a list of integers of length n with vis[s] equal to 1 and other values unchanged.**

In this final state, the value of `s` has been updated to `p[s]`, and the value of `k` has been decremented by 1. The value of `mx` has been updated to the maximum of its original value and `cur + k * a[s] + a[s]`, which is the new maximum value after considering the updated `cur` and `k`. The value of `cur` has been incremented by `2 * a[s]`, which is the sum of the original `cur` and `a[s]`. The value of `vis[s]` has been set to 1, indicating that the index `s` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged.
