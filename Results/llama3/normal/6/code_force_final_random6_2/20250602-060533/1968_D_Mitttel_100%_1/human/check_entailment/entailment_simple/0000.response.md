Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. It then calls the function `func_1` twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position, to calculate their respective scores.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the score for a given starting position. It uses a while loop to iterate through the permutation, keeping track of the current position, the current score, and the maximum score that can be achieved. It also uses a visited array to keep track of the positions that have been visited to avoid infinite loops.

The function returns the maximum score that can be achieved from the given starting position.

The main program then compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
