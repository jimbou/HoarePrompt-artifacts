The code initializes several variables and a list. The first line assigns the length of list `p` to `n`. The second and third lines initialize `mx` and `cur` to 0. The fourth line creates a list `vis` of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.

Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p), k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of zeros of length n.**
