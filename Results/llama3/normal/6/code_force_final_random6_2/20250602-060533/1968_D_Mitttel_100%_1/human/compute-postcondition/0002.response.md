Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is an integer equal to p[s], k is an integer equal to k - 1, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is equal to cur + a[s], and vis is a list of zeros of length n with vis[s] equal to 1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list `a` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers. The list `p` also remains unchanged, still containing distinct integers from 1 to its length. The variable `s` now holds an integer value equal to the value of `p[s]`. The value of `k` has decreased by 1. The length of `p`, denoted by `n`, remains the same. The maximum value `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `cur` and `k` times the value of `a[s]`. The current value `cur` has been incremented by the value of `a[s]`. The list `vis` still has a length of `n`, but the value at index `s` has been set to 1, indicating that it has been visited.
