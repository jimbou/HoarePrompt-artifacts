Functionality: This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a list of non-negative integers (a) in a specific order defined by another list of distinct integers (p), starting from a given position (s) and taking a limited number of steps (k). The function returns the maximum value that can be achieved by adding the current value at the starting position to the sum of the values at the subsequent positions, considering the limited number of steps.
