Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program takes input for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha. It then reads the permutation and array elements.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and taking a limited number of steps `k`. This function iterates through the permutation, keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved by adding the current value at position `s` to the sum of the values at the subsequent positions, considering the limited number of steps.

The main part of the program iterates through each test case, calls `func_1` for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions, and compares their scores to determine the winner.

Correctness: **True**
