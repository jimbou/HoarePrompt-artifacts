Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the list `a` in a specific order defined by the list `p`, starting from a given position `s` and taking a limited number of steps `k`.
3. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of the game. It keeps track of the current position `s`, the current score `cur`, and the maximum score `mx` that can be achieved. It also keeps track of the number of steps `k` remaining.
4. The function `func_1` correctly updates the current position `s`, the current score `cur`, and the maximum score `mx` at each step.
5. The function `func_1` correctly returns the maximum score `mx` that can be achieved.
6. The main program correctly calls the function `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions and compares their scores to determine the winner.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic of the game and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
