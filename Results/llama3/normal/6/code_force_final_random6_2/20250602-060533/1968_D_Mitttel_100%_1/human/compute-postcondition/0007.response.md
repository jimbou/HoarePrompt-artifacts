Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is an integer equal to p[s], k is 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + k * a[s], and vis is a list of integers of length n with vis[s] equal to 1 and other values unchanged.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The list `a` remains unchanged, `p` remains a list of distinct integers from 1 to `len(p)`, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]`, `k` is 0, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is the maximum of the original `mx` and `cur + k * a[s] + a[s]`, `cur` is equal to `cur + k * a[s]`, and `vis` is a list of integers of length `n` with `vis[s]` equal to 1 and other values unchanged.
