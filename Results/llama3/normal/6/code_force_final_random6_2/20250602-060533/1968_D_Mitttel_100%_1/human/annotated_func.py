#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p), and k is a non-negative integer.
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is an integer equal to p[s], k is 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + k * a[s], and vis is a list of integers of length n with vis[s] equal to 1 and other values unchanged.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], where mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + k * a[s], k is 0, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is an integer equal to p[s], p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), and n is the length of p.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a list of non-negative integers (a) in a specific order defined by another list of distinct integers (p), starting from a given position (s) and taking a limited number of steps (k). The function returns the maximum value that can be achieved by adding the current value at position s to the sum of the values at the subsequent positions, considering the limited number of steps.
