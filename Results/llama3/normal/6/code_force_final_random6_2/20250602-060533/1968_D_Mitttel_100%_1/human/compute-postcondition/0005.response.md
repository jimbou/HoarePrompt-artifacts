To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `vis`, `s`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `vis[s]` is 1, which means `not vis[s]` is False. To make `not vis[s]` True, we need to adjust `vis[s]` to 0.

The state of `s` is not explicitly mentioned, but since `vis[s]` is 1, we can infer that `s` is an index in the list `vis`. We don't need to adjust `s` explicitly.

The state of `k` is greater than or equal to 0, which is not sufficient to ensure the loop can execute again. We need to adjust `k` to be greater than 0.

The other variables, `a`, `p`, `n`, `mx`, `cur`, and the other values in `vis`, do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `p` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), `s` is an integer equal to p[s], `k` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of p, `mx` is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], `cur` is equal to cur + 2 * a[s], and `vis` is a list of integers of length n with vis[s] equal to 0 and other values unchanged.**
