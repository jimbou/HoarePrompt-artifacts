You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p), and k is a non-negative integer.
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is an integer equal to p[s], k is 0, n is the length of p, mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + k * a[s], and vis is a list of integers of length n with vis[s] equal to 1 and other values unchanged.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], where mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + k * a[s], k is 0, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is an integer equal to p[s], p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), and n is the length of p.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], where mx is the maximum of the original mx and cur + k * a[s] + a[s], cur is equal to cur + k * a[s], k is 0, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is an integer equal to p[s], p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), and n is the length of p.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
