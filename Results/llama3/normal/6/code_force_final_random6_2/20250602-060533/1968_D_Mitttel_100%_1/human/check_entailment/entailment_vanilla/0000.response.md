Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to certain rules. The player with the higher score after a certain number of turns wins the game.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It then reads the permutation and the array of scores.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position. This function uses a greedy approach, always choosing the move that maximizes the score.

The main part of the program iterates over each test case, calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function, and then compares these scores to determine the winner.

The program correctly implements the rules of the game and the greedy approach to maximize the score. However, there is a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function only considers the case where the player stays at the same position, but it does not consider the case where the player moves to a different position. This means that the function may not always return the maximum possible score.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
