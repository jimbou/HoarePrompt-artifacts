Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `cou` is increased by 1.**

The value of `cou` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The loop continues with the next iteration because the frequency of `i` in `arr` is less than 2.
