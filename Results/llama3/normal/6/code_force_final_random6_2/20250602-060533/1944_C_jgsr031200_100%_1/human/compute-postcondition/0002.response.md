The code increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is initially 0. After the increment, `freq[i]` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 1, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
