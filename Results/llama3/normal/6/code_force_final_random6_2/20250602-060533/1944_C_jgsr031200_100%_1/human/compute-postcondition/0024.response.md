Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1, and we continue to the next line of code inside the current loop.**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `arr`, `freq`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code inside the loop continues to execute because the frequency of `i` in `arr` is less than 2.
