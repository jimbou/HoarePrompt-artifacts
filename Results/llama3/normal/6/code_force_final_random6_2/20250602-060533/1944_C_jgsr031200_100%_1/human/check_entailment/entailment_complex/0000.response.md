Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and deleting them, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the remaining array.

The program first reads the input array and calculates the frequency of each element in the array. It then iterates over the frequency list to find the first element that appears only once or does not appear at all in the array. This element is the MEX of the array, which is the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, as it accurately calculates the frequency of each element and finds the first element that meets the condition for the MEX. The program also handles the case where the input array is empty, as it will print 0 in this case.

However, the program has some unnecessary code and variables, such as the `big` variable and the `func_1` function call. These can be removed without affecting the program's correctness.

Overall, the program is correct and effectively solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
