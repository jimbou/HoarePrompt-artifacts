This function takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer n as input, calculates the frequency of each integer in the list, and prints the first integer that appears only once or does not appear at all in the list. The function modifies the input list by creating a frequency list and iterating over it to find the desired integer. The function returns no value but prints the result to the console.
