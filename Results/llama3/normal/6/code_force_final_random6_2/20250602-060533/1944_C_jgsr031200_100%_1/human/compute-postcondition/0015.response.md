Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0. If the current value of `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is 1. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
