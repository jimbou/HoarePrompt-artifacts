Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the array elements.
2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the array as input and calculates the frequency of each integer in the array using a list `freq`.
3. The program iterates over the `freq` list to find the first integer that appears only once or does not appear at all in the array. This is done by checking if the frequency of the current integer is 1 or 0.
4. If the frequency of the current integer is 1, the program increments a counter `cou`. If `cou` becomes 2 or the frequency of the current integer is 0, the program prints the current integer as the result.
5. The program correctly handles the case where the input array is empty or contains only one element.

The execution summary provided matches the program's behavior, and the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
