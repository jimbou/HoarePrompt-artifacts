Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1 and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
