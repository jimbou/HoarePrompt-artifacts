According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers and `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
