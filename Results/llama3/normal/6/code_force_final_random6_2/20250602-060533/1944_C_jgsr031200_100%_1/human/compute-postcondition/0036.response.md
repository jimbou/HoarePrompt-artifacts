Output: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `cou` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
