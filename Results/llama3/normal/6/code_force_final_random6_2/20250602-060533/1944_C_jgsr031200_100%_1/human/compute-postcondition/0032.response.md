Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is at least 2, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the loop continues with the next iteration.***
