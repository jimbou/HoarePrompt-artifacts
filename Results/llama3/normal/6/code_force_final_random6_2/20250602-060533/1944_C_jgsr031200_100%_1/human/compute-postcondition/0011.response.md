The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `freq[i]` is at least 2, the value of `freq[i]` is still at least 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `freq[i]` is at least 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
