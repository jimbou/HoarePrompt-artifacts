#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: `arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n`, `cou` is either 0 or 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer n as input, calculates the frequency of each integer in the list, and prints the first integer that appears only once or does not appear at all in the list. The function modifies the input list by creating a frequency list and iterating over it to find the desired integer. The function returns no value but prints the result to the console.
