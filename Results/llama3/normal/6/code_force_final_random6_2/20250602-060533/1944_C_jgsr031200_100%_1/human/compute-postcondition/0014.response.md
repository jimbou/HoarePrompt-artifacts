Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 1, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still a non-empty list of non-negative integers, the list `freq` still has length `n + 1` and its elements represent the frequency of each integer in `arr`, the value of `n` is still at least 0, and the value of `i` is still 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is still 1.
