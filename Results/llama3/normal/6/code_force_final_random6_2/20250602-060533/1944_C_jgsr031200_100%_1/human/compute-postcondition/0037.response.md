Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2. The state of `cou` is not affected by the `break` statement. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
