Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If `cou` is 2 or the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `cou` remains unchanged.***
