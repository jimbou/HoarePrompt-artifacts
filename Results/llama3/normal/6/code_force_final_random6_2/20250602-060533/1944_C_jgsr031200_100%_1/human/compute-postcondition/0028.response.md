Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The value of `i` is still 1, and since the code inside the loop continues to execute, the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. Additionally, the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
