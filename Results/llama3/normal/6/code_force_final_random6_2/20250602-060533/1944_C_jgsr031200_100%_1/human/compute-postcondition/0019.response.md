Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `cou` is either 2 or the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `cou` is still either 2 or the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, as the code does not modify it. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
