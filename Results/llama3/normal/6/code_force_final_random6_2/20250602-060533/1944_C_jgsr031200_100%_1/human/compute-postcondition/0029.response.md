Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` which is 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, then `cou` is increased by 1 and the code inside the loop continues to execute. Otherwise, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed.***
