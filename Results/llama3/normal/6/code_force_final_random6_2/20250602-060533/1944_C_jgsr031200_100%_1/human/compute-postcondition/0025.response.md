Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, then `cou` is increased by 1 and the code inside the loop continues to execute. Otherwise, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed.***
