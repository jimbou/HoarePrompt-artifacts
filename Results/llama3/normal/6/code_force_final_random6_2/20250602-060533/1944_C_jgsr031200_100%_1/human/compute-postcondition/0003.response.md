The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 1, `i` is the first element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 1, `i` is the second element in `arr`**
