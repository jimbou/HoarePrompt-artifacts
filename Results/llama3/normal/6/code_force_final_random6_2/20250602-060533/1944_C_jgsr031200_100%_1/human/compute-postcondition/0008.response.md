Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0**

The code initializes a new variable `cou` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables, `arr` and `freq`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `cou` with its assigned value, and the unchanged values of `arr` and `freq` as described in the initial state.
