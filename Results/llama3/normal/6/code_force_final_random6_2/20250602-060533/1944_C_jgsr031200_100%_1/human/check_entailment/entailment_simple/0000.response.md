Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array of integers. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program first reads the input array and calculates the frequency of each integer in the array. It then iterates through the frequency array and checks for the following conditions:

1. If the frequency of an integer is greater than or equal to 2, it skips that integer.
2. If the frequency of an integer is 1, it increments a counter `cou`.
3. If the counter `cou` is equal to 2 or the frequency of an integer is 0, it prints the current integer `i` and breaks the loop.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. By iterating through the frequency array and checking the conditions, the program is able to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, which is the MEX of the array c.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the possible cases:

* If the input array contains all non-negative integers from 0 to n-1, the program will print 0, which is the correct MEX.
* If the input array contains all non-negative integers from 0 to n-1, except for one integer, the program will print the missing integer, which is the correct MEX.
* If the input array contains duplicate integers, the program will skip them and find the correct MEX.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
