Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of Alice's array. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the array, then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n. If a number has a frequency of 1, it increments a counter. If the counter reaches 2 or the frequency of a number is 0, it prints the current number as the MEX.

This strategy is correct because Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to include as many numbers as possible in her array. By choosing numbers with a frequency of 1, she ensures that Bob cannot choose the same number, thus maximizing the MEX. If a number has a frequency of 0, it means that Bob has already chosen that number, so Alice cannot include it in her array, and the MEX is the current number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the input array is empty, or the case where all numbers in the array have a frequency of 1. Therefore, the program is correct.
