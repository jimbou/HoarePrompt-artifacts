Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is that `arr` remains a non-empty list of non-negative integers, and `freq` becomes a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1`, where each index `i` in `freq` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`.
