The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the second element in `arr`. The value of `i` is the second element in `arr`, so `freq[i]` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 2, `i` is the second element in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 2, `i` is the second element in `arr`.**
