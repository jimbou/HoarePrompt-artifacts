Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n`, `cou` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n`, and the value of `cou` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the frequency of any `i` in `arr` is 1. The loop has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement when `cou` is 2 or the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 0.
