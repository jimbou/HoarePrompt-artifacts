According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0**
