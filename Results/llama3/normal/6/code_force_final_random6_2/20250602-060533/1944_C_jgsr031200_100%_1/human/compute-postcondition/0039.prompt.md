Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0. If `cou` is 2 or the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` which is 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, then `cou` is increased by 1 and the code inside the loop continues to execute. Otherwise, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n + 1` where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If `cou` is 2 or the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `cou` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
