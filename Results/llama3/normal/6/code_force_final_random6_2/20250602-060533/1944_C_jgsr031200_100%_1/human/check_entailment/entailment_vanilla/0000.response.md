Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array of integers. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the array elements. It then defines a function func_1 that takes the array as input and calculates the frequency of each element in the array.

The function then iterates over the frequency array and checks for the first occurrence of an element that has a frequency of 1 or 0. If it finds such an element, it prints the index of that element as the final score of the game.

The reasoning behind this approach is that Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she wants to include as many elements as possible in the array c. On the other hand, Bob wants to minimize the score, which means he wants to exclude as many elements as possible from the array c.

By iterating over the frequency array and checking for the first occurrence of an element with a frequency of 1 or 0, the program is essentially finding the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array c, which is the definition of the MEX.

Therefore, the given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
