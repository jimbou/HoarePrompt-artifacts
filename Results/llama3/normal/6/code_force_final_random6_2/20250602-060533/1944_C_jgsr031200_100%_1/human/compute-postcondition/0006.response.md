Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 3, `i` is the third element in `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables, `arr` and `i`, remain unchanged. The length of `freq` is still `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The index `i` in `freq` now has a value of 3, indicating that the third element in `arr` has a frequency of 3.
