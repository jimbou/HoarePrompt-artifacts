Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading one book with the highest number in each pile. The given program sorts the input numbers in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest numbers, which corresponds to the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly implements the required logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It processes all test cases and terminates as expected.

Correctness: **True**
