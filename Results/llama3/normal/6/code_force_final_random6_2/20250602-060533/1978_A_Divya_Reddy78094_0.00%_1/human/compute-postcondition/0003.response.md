Based on the precondition, we know that `nums` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.

The `print` statement is printing the sum of the first two elements of the `nums` list, which are `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` is the second-largest integer in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **The sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list**
