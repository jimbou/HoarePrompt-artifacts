Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, _ is t-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the two largest numbers in the list is being printed**.

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` still represents the number of integers in the last test case, and `nums` is still a sorted list of those integers in descending order. The variable `_` has been incremented to `t-1`, which is -1 in this case, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been processed. Finally, the sum of the first two elements of the list `nums`, which are the two largest numbers in the list, is being printed.
