To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
