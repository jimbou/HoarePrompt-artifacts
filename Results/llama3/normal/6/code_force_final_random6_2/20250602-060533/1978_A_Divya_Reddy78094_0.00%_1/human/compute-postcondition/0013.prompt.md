Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    print(nums[0] + nums[1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the two largest numbers in the list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the two largest numbers in the list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the two largest numbers in the list is being printed which is equal to nums[0] + nums[1]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
