The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) first, and that integer is assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
