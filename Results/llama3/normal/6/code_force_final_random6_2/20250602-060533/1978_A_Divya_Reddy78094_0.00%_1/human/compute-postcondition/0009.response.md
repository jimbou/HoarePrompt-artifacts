The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums which are the two largest numbers in the list is being printed**
