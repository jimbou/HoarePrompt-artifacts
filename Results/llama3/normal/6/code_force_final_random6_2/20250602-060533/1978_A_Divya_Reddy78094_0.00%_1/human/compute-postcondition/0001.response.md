The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to 0, since it will be the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `_` is 0**
