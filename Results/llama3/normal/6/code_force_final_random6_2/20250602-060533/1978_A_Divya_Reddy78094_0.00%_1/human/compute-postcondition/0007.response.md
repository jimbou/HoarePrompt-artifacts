The code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list `nums` in descending order.
Since `nums` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, the first two elements (`nums[0]` and `nums[1]`) are the largest and second-largest integers in the list, respectively.
Output: **the sum of the largest and second-largest integers in the sorted list nums**
