Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, it remains an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `nums`. Since `nums` was previously a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, it remains a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order. The third line sorts `nums` in descending order. Since `nums` was already sorted in descending order, this line does not change the state of `nums`. 

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2 as two inputs are read from stdin.
