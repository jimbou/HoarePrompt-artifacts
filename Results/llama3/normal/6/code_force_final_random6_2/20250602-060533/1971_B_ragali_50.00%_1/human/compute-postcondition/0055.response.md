Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, s is a string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, i is the last character in the string s, a is a set containing all unique characters in the string s, and the current value of a contains more than one unique character, newstr is a string that is a rotation of s by half its length, isreverse is a string that is the reverse of s, 'YES' is being printed. If newstr is not equal to s, then the second half of the string s followed by the first half of the string s is being printed. If newstr is equal to s, then if the reverse of s is not equal to s, the reverse of s is being printed. Otherwise, the second half of the string s followed by the first half of the string s is being printed.**
