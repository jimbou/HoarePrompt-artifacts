Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, s is an empty string, i is the last character in the string s, a is a set containing all unique characters from the input string s. If newstr is not equal to s, the second half of the string s concatenated with the first half of the string s is printed. If newstr is equal to s, the string s is rearranged by swapping its first and second halves, and if isreverse is equal to s, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the value of isreverse is printed.***
