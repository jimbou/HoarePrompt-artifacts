The code `t = int(input().strip(' '))` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, then assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and then `t` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10. The first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) which is assigned to `t`. The stdin now contains `t` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` inputs: strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10.**
