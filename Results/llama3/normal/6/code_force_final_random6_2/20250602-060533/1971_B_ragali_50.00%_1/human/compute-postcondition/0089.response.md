Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all characters in the string `s`, `t` is greater than the last character in the string `s` plus 1, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `stdin` is empty. If `a` has more than one character, 'YES' is printed. If the rotation of `s` by half its length is not equal to `s`, then the second half of the string `s` followed by the first half of the string `s` is printed. If the rotation of `s` by half its length is equal to `s` and the reverse of `s` is not equal to `s`, the reverse of `s` is printed. If the rotation of `s` by half its length is equal to `s` and the reverse of `s` is equal to `s`, then the second half of the string `s` followed by the first half of the string `s` is printed. If `a` has only one character, 'NO' is printed.***
