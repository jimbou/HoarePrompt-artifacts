According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 1, i is the last character in the string s, a is an empty set. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and the i is the first character in the string s.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `s` is a string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the string `s`, `a` is an empty set**
