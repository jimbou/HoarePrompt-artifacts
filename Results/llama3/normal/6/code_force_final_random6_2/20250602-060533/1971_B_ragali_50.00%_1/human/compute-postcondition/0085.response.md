Postcondition: ***s is a non-empty string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, a is a set containing all characters in the string s and has more than one character, t is greater than the last character in the string s plus 1, i is the last character in the string s, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed. If the rotation of s by half its length (newstr) is not equal to s, then the second half of the string s followed by the first half of the string s is being printed. If the rotation of s by half its length (newstr) is equal to s, then if the reverse of s (isreverse) is not equal to s, the reverse of s (isreverse) is being printed. If the rotation of s by half its length (newstr) is equal to s and the reverse of s (isreverse) is equal to s, then the second half of the string s followed by the first half of the string s is being printed.***
