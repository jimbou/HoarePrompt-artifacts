This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string has more than one unique character, and if so, prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string. The modification is either a rotation of the string (swapping its first and second halves) or its reverse, depending on whether the original string is equal to its rotation or reverse. If a string has only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple strings based on an initial input specifying the number of strings to process.
