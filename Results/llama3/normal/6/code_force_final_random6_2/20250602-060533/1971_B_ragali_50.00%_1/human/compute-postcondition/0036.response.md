To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is not the last character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, and `s` must have at least 2 characters.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the third character in the string `s`, and `s` must have at least 3 characters. Additionally, `a` must contain the first, second, and third characters of `s`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `s` is a string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `a` is a set containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`.**
