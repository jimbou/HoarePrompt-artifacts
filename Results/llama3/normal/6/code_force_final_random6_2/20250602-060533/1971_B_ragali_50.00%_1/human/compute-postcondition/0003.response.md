The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s is not empty the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an empty set. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must not be empty and the i is 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, s is the input value from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed and must not be empty, a is an empty set**
