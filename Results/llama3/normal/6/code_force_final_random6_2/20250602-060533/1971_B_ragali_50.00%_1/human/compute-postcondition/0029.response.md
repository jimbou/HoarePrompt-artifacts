Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `s` is an empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the input string `s`. If the number of unique characters in `s` is more than 1, then if newstr is not equal to s, the second half of the string s concatenated with the first half of the string s is printed. If newstr is equal to s, the string s is rearranged by swapping its first and second halves, and if isreverse is equal to s, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the value of isreverse is printed. If the number of unique characters in `s` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed.***
