The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has a length reduced by 1, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 1 character and `i` is the next character in the string `s`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `s` is the input value from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed and has a length reduced by 1, `a` is a set containing the values 0 and the next character in the string `s`**
