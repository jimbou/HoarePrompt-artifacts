Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `s` is a string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in the string `s`. If `a` contains more than one unique character, 'YES' is printed and either the reverse of `s` or the second half of `s` followed by the first half of `s` is printed depending on whether the reverse of `s` is equal to `s` or not. If `a` contains only one unique character, 'NO' is printed.***
