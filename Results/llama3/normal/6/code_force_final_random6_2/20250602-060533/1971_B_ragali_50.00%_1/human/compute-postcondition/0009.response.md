Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `s` is an empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the input string `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have `t` remaining greater than 0, `i` will be the last character processed from the string `s`, the string `s` will be empty since all its characters would have been processed, and the set `a` will contain all unique characters that were present in the input string `s`.
